#### [WP] For years an alien race has been intercepting audio transmissions from Earth and understands English. However, they have been exclusively listening to X-Box Live conversations. They have now prepared their first message for Earth.

Score: 7568

Greetings, faggots:

My name is xXSwaGGy-Quarlax [FaZe], Interplanetary Diplomat for the Andromeda Galaxy. I would like to begin this message by assuring you that I am not a camping faggot, nor will my people attempt to quick scope you. Although we have amassed many 360 no scopes throughout our collective lives, we come with a message of peace. I hope to make clear that this is a knife-only match and we will not be attempting any faggotry, nor will we feed mid. We wish only to share our swag amongst your people, you fucking aim botting hackers. 

My clan and I have traveled many millions of light years in search of sentient life, visiting thousands of planets in an attempt to make contact and find the dankest kush. While we have been forced to pwn many noobs and fuck countless mothers on several of those worlds, reking their shit harder than a Haitian Earthquake, we only did so out of self-preservation. None of those planets held any life beyond the hostile and untamable, nor any blunts to blaze upon. It was truly us against them; however, we wish to make it clear that we do have blood on our hands. We, as an intergalactic species, understand that trust is founded upon honesty, and thus tell you retard hackers of our former faggotry. That said, we assure you that your obese, apartment dwelling neckbeards will stand safely beside us and shall never be shrekt.

We first located your planet nearly six Earth years ago and have been monitoring your communication devices, which you call “X-Box,” to learn your jargon and construct our message of peace. We hope that you understand our dialect and not see us as pay 2 win feeders. In order to further express our good faith, we have amassed a large collection of Code Red Mountain Dew and Cool Ranch Doritos, which we would like to share with your MLG pros. We hope you accept our offering in peace, and that you not fuck our mothers. We wish only to become allies with you, the faggot tryhards of Earth. 

Please find us waiting for you at your trailer park tomorrow at sunrise. We will be in the large flying aircraft, which should be just a few pounds lighter than that of your mother's left tit.

Ayy lmao,

xXSwaGGy-Quarlax [FaZe]

#### [WP] At the age of 18 you are permitted to redistribute your twenty skill points around into whatever skills you want permanently. You decided to put everything into LUCK and leave the rest at 0 points.

Score: 6116

"That's not a good idea, Ben. For one, we don't have great data on the actual effects of enhanced Luck..."

"Look, can you do it or not? I need this."

The gene tech sighed in the quiet office and swiveled his chair back to the computer. He was looking at a fairly standard representation of a human genome, red highlights in the mass of blue to indicate genes with likely altered function from human baseline and green to indicate potential areas for change.

"Let's see, we have some modifiable options at rs2981205, rs730882133, rs423454-"

"Yeah, man, I get it, lots of fancy words. Bottom line it for me?" Ben shifted impatiently in his chair; flipping his phone from hand to hand.

"Based on population-level studies and retrospective analysis of lottery winners, survivors of freak accidents, etc, there's about 20 genes we could modify in you to try to make you luckier. I'm obligated to point out that we don't know for sure that these genes actually *cause* better luck, and frankly the latest research is casting some doubts on the validity-"

"Yeah, yeah, I signed the waiver already, do what you got to do; I have a lot riding on this."

"Um, you already made the bet? And you want to get lucky now?"

"Not exactly, I don't really want to explain."

"Whatever, they're your genes. Sign this form here, some more standard stuff. Given the specific genes we need to modify, you are looking at 85% chance for significant loss in strength, 90% chance for loss in fine and gross motor skills, 100% for loss in intelligence, 60% chance for loss in overall body aesthetic and symmetry, and 50% chance for loss in short and long term memory."

Ben, took the tablet, skimming over most of the form. When he had scrolled to the bottom, he pressed his finger on the fingerprint scanner, acknowledging his agreement. He let his shoulders relax afterwards, like a weight had been lifted off.

"Ok then" he said to himself in a quieter voice; "that's settled."

"Not quite, Ben. Given the severity of potential deficits you are required to provide a sperm sample on the chance that you would prefer to have unaltered children in the future. Furthermore, while we strongly suggest implantable birth control for all men and women that undergo elective alteration, per the 2024 SAFEGene act, prior to sexual intercourse with any potentially fertile partners, you both must be screened for possible gene incompatibility."

"Yeah, everyone knows the rules."

"OK, here's your sample cup; I'll give you some time to provide the sample and I'll get the CRISPR transfer virus ready."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ben rolled up his sleeve, exposing a slightly faded tattoo; a simple heart motif with the name "Jess" on it.

"Just a slight poke, then you'll be all set. This is your last chance to change your mind..."

"Get it over with."

"OK"

The tech injected Ben's left deltoid with the modified viral delivery system. Over the next 48 hours, the virus, a modified version of the flu, would infect the vast majority of his cells and re-write all of his DNA.

"It's done. Now, you'll probably have some soreness, fatigue, and a fever for the next couple days, similar to flu symptoms. This virus isn't contagious, but to be safe, you need to avoid the very young and the elderly. Take tylenol if the fever or pain get bad. If you have difficulty breathing, pass out, or anything like that, get to a hospital immediately."

"Got it. Thanks, doc."

"Good luck."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two months later, Ben's life, as far as any outsider was concerned, was pretty much unchanged. He'd had to quit his job as a barista; it was a bit too fast paced for him with his new weakness and difficultly remembering simple tasks. He'd found a perfect job, working at one of the few private libraries remaining in Baltimore. He'd only get one or two customers a day and they were usually older; if anything, Ben found himself getting along better with them than people his own age; the elderly clients seemed to talk and move at the pace he was accustomed to these days.

He settled in well to his new life; he was more lonely than he had been, but that suited him well. He had a new companion, in the form of a stray he named Tipsy, that had wandered up to his feet when he was getting back to his apartment one night. She only had three paws and occasionally fell over, but they were fast friends.

All in all, his life was stable, boring; an easy sort of anguish. And every day, as he left the library, sometimes with Tipsy peeking out of his backpack along with a few children's books; the short ones with the easier words, he would take the 57 bus and transfer to the 23 to get to the long term care facility. There he would take the elevator to the fourth floor, his legs a bit too weak for the stairs, and sit next to Jess, who was perpetually silent except for the occasional hiss and beep of the ventilator, and read to her. Often, he would fall asleep in the chair next to her, dreaming that perhaps tomorrow would be his lucky day, and he would get to talk to her again.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

So all of you are ridiculous, amazing people. Thank you for reading and for sharing your thoughts and feedback about the story! Definitely a deeply motivating experience to write more in the future.

#### [WP] A wife kills her husband. Make me sympathize with both characters.

Score: 6086

He was drunker than usual.  Ordinarily, she would feel relief when he collapsed onto the couch by the TV.  That meant he was too drunk to yell and fight.  Tonight, she felt no relief.  All she could do was watch him from the doorway, hoping he would drink the poisoned whiskey she had just poured him.

A lump sat in her throat as she watched his fat belly rise and fall with his labored breath.  In his hand, he held the last drink she would ever pour for him.  He sat there for a few minutes in silence without even looking at the glass of whiskey he clutched in his fat fingers.  Then, without warning, he downed the entire glass in one movement.

He let the glass hit the ground and sighed.  He would go to sleep soon.  It wouldn’t be painful.  Nowhere near as painful as the last twenty-three years had been for her.  She wanted him to leave the world peacefully.  She still loved him, after all.  Still, she felt he deserved an explanation.  At the very least, he deserved a good-bye.

She walked around to the front of the couch.  He rolled his half-opened eyes in her direction and the two stared at each other in silence.

“There was more than whiskey in your drink,” she said, her voice shaking.  “I’m sorry.”

“Your black eye is healing,” he said quietly.  “You know I’m sorry about hurting you.  Don’t you?”

She nodded.

“You were very beautiful once.  I can still see it sometimes.  When you smile.  You don’t smile much these days.  But when you do, your eyes flash like they did when we were teenagers.  It reminds me of how young and beautiful we were.  Young, beautiful, and carefree.”

“Your drink,” she said with tears forming in her eyes.  “You’re dying.  I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.”

“I know,” he whispered and slowly nodded.  “I saw you pour it.”

She put her hands over her mouth and tried not to cry.

“Do you remember that field trip we took during our second year of high school?” he asked.

She shook her head.

“We spent the whole day together,” he said as his voice became fainter.  “It was the first time I really met you.  There were fifty or sixty of us there but I only cared about you.  On the bus ride home, we sat next to each other.  Do you remember now?”

She nodded.

“Everybody on the bus slept.  They were so tired.  But not us.  We couldn’t stop talking to each other.  We had so much to say back then.  When you started to drift off to sleep, I was sad.  But then you said something to me.  Do you remember what it was?”

“I-” she paused to steady her voice.  “I’m going to lean on you, ok?”

“Yeah,” he said as a smile slowly spread across his face.  “And you fell asleep on my shoulder.  I couldn’t sleep the whole bus ride because I was so happy that we were having that moment.  And I know you didn’t sleep either.  The bus bounced too much.  And back then my arms were muscular.  You just wanted to be close to me.  I’m sorry I was such a lousy pillow.  And I’m sorry I was an even lousier husband.”

She wanted to say something but could not.

His voice slowed even further.  He spoke as if he was in a dream.  “I still love you as much as I did on that bus ride.  I just got worse at showing it.  I’m sorry.”

She did not reply.  She just stood and tried to compose herself.  After a moment, she walked over and sat next to him on the couch.  

“I’m going to lean on you, ok?” she whispered.

“Ok,” he replied as she rested her head against his arm.

The two sat in silence until his breathing stopped at last.

#### [WP] You are a teenager with the ability to measure how "Dangerous" people are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice the unassuming new kid at school measures a 10.

Score: 5584

I was fourteen when it all started. I'd been out one day, waiting for some friends at the park, as you do. I was eating a chocolate bar and apathetically tossed the wrapper aside. An old lady approached me. 

"Don't you have any respect? Pick that up."

Naturally I ignored her, being the lovely young man that I was until she screamed.

"Fine! Have it your way! If you shall litter the Earth, then I shall litter your mind."

She promptly left and I was confused, I assumed she was just a bit of an old bat. The wrapper blew away, and my friends turned up. We played some football, I was always fairly horrendous at that. 

The next day, I woke up. For some reason the first thing I thought of was the old lady. I realised that it was fairly obnoxious for me to act that way to someone. Ah well, I'll probably never see her again anyway. I went downstairs and greeted my mother who has been a bit of a struggling single for a while now (I guess having an obnoxious teenage brat doesn't help much). There was a two, hovering above her head; cyan in colour. I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time. I knew that, objectively, this was strange. Intuitively, however, it felt oddly natural. So I went about my day.

As I went through school that day, I noticed everybody had the numbers. Notably my friend Tim who was a brown belt in karate had a blue four, our loud ex-military teacher who enjoyed startling sleeping students was a yellow six. The school bully was a turquoise three. Most students were a one or a two; shades of green. I could never see a number above my own head in reflections or anything like that, much to my frustration. 

When I watched TV I noticed that powerful people tended to have quite high numbers. The anchor had a five, the prime minister had a nine, some footage of an army doing a parade seemed to show a range from six to eight (a vibrant red).

Eventually, after having thought about this for a few weeks, I concluded that the number corresponded to danger. Being dangerous can mean many things. It can mean you're potent in a fight, or it can mean you have a lot of say socially. 

One day, I was sitting in the park with my mother and some of her friends on a day out. She introduced me to someone new. Short, goatee, slicked back hair and an eight. He sat there, casually sipping on a can of lager. My mum introduced him as Sean, "my new boyfriend."

"WHAT?!"

So I couldn't control that little outburst, I must admit I panicked a bit. An eight is a member of the cabinet, a soldier, a serial murderer (What? The numbers come up on Crimewatch as well, you know). 

He interjected, "Haha! Relax kid. I'm going to be around for a while" 

At which point he leaned in and kissed my mum. This was not affection; this was dominance.

In the following days, I took my mum aside repeatedly to try to convince her to get out of this. She was, how can I put it? Thoroughly unwilling. So now I was anxious, I was frustrated. We were around Sean's house at the time. He came in later that day, bringing home some shopping, he bought me a chocolate bar. Well, that was nice? Thanks.

So it started out nicely enough. He could tell that I was anxious, and so he'd buy me little things to try to win my affections. To be honest, it started to work. My mum was in love with him and despite the red flags, I was honestly settling to the arrangement. What I hadn't noticed were the little things. At first it began as complaints; "the jam isn't in the cupboard I said to put it in", "clean up that fucking cat shit". Benign, but said with a sharp tongue.

Eventually he offered to fully support my mother. I'm not really sure how he was able to do this as he didn't have a job of which to speak, but it seemed to work out. My mum quit her job at the supermarket and now had much more free time to... "do those fucking dishes," to "make a doctor's appointment for me". He spoke repeatedly of their sex life to me. Thanks for telling me. Over time his demands were shouting.

Mum's number dropped from a two to a one. Something was wrong.

This kind of behaviour carried on for a year. I was the frog in the pot.

Eventually he started doing things; hitting her when I wasn't around. I didn't notice of course, although I started to pick up the signs. Then one day I did. They had a huge argument. They were shouting, things were thrown. They wouldn't stop. The walls closed in. I had nowhere to go. In my right conscience, I had nowhere I could go. I was just as frightened as she was until that is I heard a crack; he headbutted her. Blood poured forth. I freaked the fuck out. I started screaming. I started crying. I had no idea what way was up. I briefly ran into the bathroom to try  to collect myself and figure out what the fuck I was supposed to do. I was scared. I was shaking. I was angry. I was livid. I was FURIOUS. And through the tears I saw the stained bathroom mirror. Everything was blurry but I saw it right there. Black as night, floating right above my own head. I could finally see it: Ten.

"Fuck them, fuck him, fuck everyone. Fuck this abusive piece of shit. I am taking control of this situation." 

In that very briefly lucid state, I called an ambulance.

I then broke the mirror, threw it at the ground. I picked the the largest shard of glass and looked at myself again. Ten. Definitely ten.

I called down. "Sean! Let's fucking talk!"

#### [WP] "Adulthood is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane."

Score: 5567

"I'm sorry to bring you here like this."

"Not at all, my dear boy. Not at all."

"But, you see, I have to know… I have to know, and you're the only one –"

"I get it," the old man interrupted me. He puffed his cheeks weakly, like it took him great effort just to breathe, 
and then he leaned back against the armchair and his eyes turned to the crackling of the fireplace. "Ask away."

"Well… it's pretty simple, actually." I leaned forward. "What's it like?"

His eyes turned to me, and he almost smiled. *"What's it like?"*

"Yeah. Life. Growing up. Being old." I paused. "Well, not that I'm calling you old, I just –"

"It's okay, dear boy," he laughed. "I am old. That's why you brought me here."

I said nothing. He arranged himself on the armchair like he had all the time in the world. Then his eyes went up to 
me again. "It's… hard."

I waited. I knew he wasn't done.

"It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, actually" he continued. "Harder than building all this fancy equipment you've built. Harder than studying all you've studied. Harder than winning all these scientific awards you've won so far." He chuckled. "Nothing prepares you for it."

"What makes it hard?" I asked. "Is it the responsibilities? The body decaying? What makes growing up so hard?"

"No. It's not the responsibilities. Growing up is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane." He lowered his head as if to put his thoughts together, then continued. "It's the things you don't expect that catch you by surprise. Sure, it's scary to have a kid, and to get married, and to ask your boss for a promotion, and all these grown-up stuff we have to *pretend* we know how to do."

"Pretend?"

He seemed surprised. "Yes, pretend. No one really grows up, of course. We put on a face to the world, but at home, three in the morning, all alone watching TV, you're still sixteen. All of us are." He shook his head. "There's nothing more heartbreaking than being a real person and sitting down in front of another real person, and then both of you have to act like fake people. You sit across from someone two years older than you in a job interview and you both say 'Hello, sir' and 'Yes, I also think the Dow Jones has been fluctuating dangerously this last few days' and 'Oh, absolutely, the 405 is a nightmare this time of day'. And all along you *know* you both laugh at poop jokes and fart sounds and you have all these hobbies and interests and you curse and say fuck and shit and asshole. You're real people. But you act like robots. You have to put on the face, and they have to put on a face, and you have to pretend that nothing in life is ever fun, everything is productivity and seriousness."

"Is that what makes it hard?" I asked. "That everyone's just… faking their way through adulthood?"

"No. No, that's expected. It sucks, but we all know what we're getting into." He sighed. "No, what catches you by 
surprise are the little things about growing up. It's being stuck in traffic and remembering a day. Any day. A locker 
room conversation in high school. A teacher. A friend of a friend. Something that happened long enough ago that 
it could order its own drink. It sneaks up on you, and you look at yourself in the rear view and you think, my 
God… where did it go? When did I become so old?

"I remember college like it was yesterday. I remember my girlfriends and my friends and they used to drink and 
talk about sex and hanging out and now they all eat oatmeal and go to funerals. And I do that to, and I *like* all of that. Well, not going to funerals, but oatmeal. Soap operas. Going to bed at nine. I like it."

"So what's the problem?"

"The problem is I'm still the sixteen year old. I'm still the college kid. My needs and wants have changed, and my 
body has changed, and my mind has changed, in a way, but *I* didn't change. I'm still putting on a face. So when 
these thoughts sneak up on me – when a flash of a college party or a roadtrip or the feeling of falling asleep in the 
back of my Dad's car wells up on me… it breaks me. It breaks me because I don't think of it fondly. I don't look at 
that young kid with affection and nostalgia, I look at him with envy. Envy, because he's got all of that ahead of him 
still, and he doesn't even know how lucky he is. He's me, we're the same – but he's got the good looks and the 
health and all the years ahead of him, and I'm wasting away in an old apartment. And I hate that kid so much. Every time he sneaks up on me I hate him more."

I looked down, then up. "What about family? Kids?"

"They are great. They are amazing. But they go away. They're not *you*. In the end, you raise your sons and 
daughters for the world, not for yourself. They have to fall asleep in the back of *my* car, and go to *their* college parties and all that… they don't exist for my benefit. No one exists for my benefit but myself. And I'm much too old to do anything about it."

I swallowed dry and averted my eyes to the fireplace. The old man leaned forward. "We always get the feeling that 
the good old days are either behind us or ahead of us. They're never our own days. We were always born just a 
bit too late to go to Woodstock or to see Nirvana live or to see the Berlin Wall fall or to party Great Gatsby style in the 20's. And then we get old and we realize we were born too soon to see the wonders of technology and the world reshaping and blooming into something new and exciting. But the truth is, our Woodstocks were happening all around us as we grew. Our new and exciting world was some old guy's boring present, and our past will be some spoiled, arrogant kid's 'Good old days'. We were just too stupid to realize it when it mattered. So we let it slide away. And then we ended up like me – sad and resentful of our younger selves for all they can still do and we can't."

Finally, I got up. I went to the old man and I knelt in front of him. "I'm sorry I brought you over."

"It's okay," he said. "I knew you would. After all, I did it, sixty years ago."

I looked at my own eyes. Despite the wrinkles around them, they still looked pretty much the same. The old man 
shook his head and sniffed a tear away. "Now let's go back to your lab so you can send me back to my own time, 
so I can hate you in peace."

I hugged my own eighty year old version and leaned away and nodded. "I'll enjoy it," I said. "And I'll know I'm living in the good old days, I promise."

He got up with difficulty. "No, you won't," he said. "The good old days are only ever good when they're gone. That's what makes them good. When you're living through them, they're just... days."

He slow-stepped ahead of me towards the lab. Then he spoke without turning his head: "And days go by really fast, man. They go by really fast."

#### [WP] You are legally allowed to commit murder once, but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions

Score: 4932

I thought I'd get there early, beat the lines.  The Department of Legal Homicide opened at 9am.  9am was a foreign concept to me.  Sometimes, in my insomniac's stupor, as dusk turned to deep, purple night and then back to rosy dawn, I'd imagine people waking up, making coffee, reading the paper, sitting down to toast.  A life like that might as well have been on another planet.  But still, I found myself getting into my car at half past eight, groggy, yes, but thrilled, invigorated with the light of the morning sun and the thought of death.

I pulled into the DLH parking lot at 8:50.  The line was already halfway down the block.  I knew that the program, since being put to a vote and passed late last year, was popular, but I still wasn't expecting this.  I also wasn't expecting the sort of people I saw standing there, on a bright morning, hungry for blood.  I'd expected dark souls, vagabonds, transients with tattooed knuckles and stringy black hair.  But there were put together young men, in button-down shirts and khakis.  There were old men, grey hair, stooped, in dingy corduroys, who looked like their years of bloodlust should have been well behind them.

And then there were the women.  Young, beautiful women with golden hair and perfect skin, buzzing with life.  And old, matronly women with deep creases on their faces, the kind you'd expect to make amazing soup from an ancient, secret recipe.  The kind that has taught half the world's daughters how to love, and hate.  And there I was, at the DLH, like a child getting his first driver's permit: scared, ecstatic, and relieved.  I was so close.

Once inside, the line shortened.  At the front of the queue was a single desk, with a single uniformed employee sitting behind it.  They asked for my I.D., and handed me a form on a clipboard.  She also gave me a number.  "They'll call you shortly.  Please have the paperwork filled out by the time you're called, or you will forfeit your place in line."

With that, I took a seat on a hard, plastic chair.  The form was straightforward: My name and address, my intended victim's name and address, and a place to sign on the bottom.  That was all.  No reason for killing, no place to list my grievances, nothing.

After what seemed like an eternity, my number was called.  The agent in charge of my case looked over my paperwork, signed their name next to mine and stamped the form with a huge, heavy stamp that exuded importance.

"You're all set," they said.

"That's it?"

"That's it."

"And, they'll know it's happening?"

"Yes, we will notify them for you."

"How do you do it?" I asked.

"They'll get a certified letter.  Do they know to expect it?"

"They do, yes."

"Good," the agent replied, "That makes things easier."

"Have you seen a case like this before?" I asked.  I didn't know why I was prolonging the conversation, but there was something comforting about the agent's stark, bureaucratic formality.

"Yes.  It's quite common, actually.  We have a whole file set aside for patricide." 

With that, a wave of relief swept over me.  There were others.  Many others, waking up early, making toast, reading the newspaper.  Others, living their entire, normal lives, waiting for the moment, the exact perfect moment, to kill their fathers.

I took my paperwork and left.  I was full of life, leaving the DLH with an exuberance I hadn't felt in years.  I don't remember a single thing about the drive to my father's house.  I could have run every red light without knowing it.  It wasn't until I pulled into his driveway that the gravity of the situation hit me.  That this was finally happening.

I've never lost the key to his house, and pulling it out on his front porch, I was overcome with a sense of nostalgia.  This key, this tool of entry from one world to another: a secret you share with only those you love and trust.  This was one of the last times I'd be using it.  Just one more tie to sever.  It fit easily in the lock.

I walked through the living room.  None of the lights were on.  I could already smell death in this house, he'd been dragging his fetid robes across the tattered carpets for months already. Waiting, like I'd waited, impatiently, hungrily.

I turned into his bedroom.  There he was, in his grey room, on his grey bed, the mattress bowed in the middle like a hammock.  It was quiet, except for the repeated, mechanical hiss and whirr of the ventilator.  I sat next to him, looked into his cloudy blue eyes.  I thought, for a second, he recognized me, but I could never be sure anymore.  I kissed him lightly on the forehead.  I said "I love you."  Then I unplugged the machine.

Walking out, into the bright light of day, I saw a pair of morning doves on a telephone wire.  I heard a dog bark.  I saw cars coming and going in their busy ways.  I felt everything.  I took it all in.  And it was fine.

Edit2: I woke up to an inbox full of nice things. Thank you!

> Now say that you won't just kill **them**. You'll also kill **their families**.

I stared at the words on the terminal in disbelief. My hands hovered over the keyboard. I wanted to reply, but... holy shit. How do you respond to an order like that??

"I can't do that!" I typed back. The keys clacked as I wrote it; the keyboard was very old. The computer and all the hardware was an old Tandy Color Computer back from 1981. You'd think I would have upgraded by now, but my Oracle preferred to stay in here. And who am I to question its orders? In nearly forty years, it really hadn't ever steered me wrong. So we stayed with this one. Everyone thought I was weird for keeping it in my office, but I just explained it away as nostalgia.

> You won't **actually** have to kill their families. You just have to threaten them.

*Oh, well that's so much better*, I thought. *Just threaten to murder innocent women and children. No big deal*.

"You know what," I wrote back, practically pounding on the ancient beige keyboard, "That's it. That's it, Oracle. I'm done with this whole thing. I quit." My hands shook as I wrote it, and my heart was hammering against my ribs. I'd wanted to do it for so long, but I just never could work up the courage to let go. 

Oracle had guided me through life since I first got the computer in the 80s. Some kid at Radio Shack told me it would give me good life advice and sold it to me on a floppy disk for two dollars, and I've never been one to pass up a good deal. I figured that at worst, it was just some piece of junk that wouldn't really do anything. This was before viruses and malware were really a thing. So I popped in the disk, and it told me that I should start brushing my teeth twice a day instead of just once. 

Every day, it was a new piece of advice. Just little things to begin with, like changing up my hairstyle or whatever, but it eventually gained my trust and started meddling more and more with my life. It gave me business advice, stock tips, real estate intelligence, and relationship advice that was always sound. Years later, I've got more money than I ever thought I could make, and I've got a beautiful family. A gorgeous wife, five wonderful children, a great job that I really enjoy... I've got everything. Fame and fortune, with none of the drug problems and mental breakdowns that usually seem to go along with those two. And yet the Oracle kept pushing. It told me that my life could always get better. That it knew exactly what to do. And so I listened. I followed along blindly, and it's led down a dark path to this. 

Oracle has made me do terrible things. I've destroyed people's careers, I've humiliated people, said horrible, nasty things that I really didn't mean... but this? Threatening to *kill* someone's family? 

> If you leave now, it will all be wasted.

The words flashed on Oracle's screen in dull green. There should be a name for that greenish color from before computer monitors could actually display real colors. I'd call it "80's green."

> Everything that you've built will crumble. You know that I am right. And you can make the **world** a better place if you just follow my orders. I've never let you down before. 

I should have just left right then and there. I could have stood up from the chair and walked out of the room and never looked at Oracle again. Just spent the rest of my life lounging on a sunny beach in Florida or something. But I didn't. I hesitated.

That night, I got up on stage and took the mic in front of thousands of cheering fans. "And we're not just going to hunt down those terrorist bastards in ISIS," I shouted. "We're gonna go after their families, too!" My stomach churned just uttering the words: I was suggesting a *war crime* like it was a good thing! But of course, the crowds ate it up. Hell, they'd applaud for anything I did nowadays. I could probably shoot someone on 5th avenue and they'd cheer. Once the thunderous wave of clapping died down, I spoke into the mic again. "Thank you, Iowa! Let's make America great again!"

#### [wp] after dying god informs you that hell is a myth, and "everyone sins, its ok". instead the dead are sorted into six "houses of heaven" based on the sins they chose.

Score: 4917

We arrived first at the House of Lust. "House" is a misleading term. It was more of a camp, spread over acres and acres of lush forest. There was a white sandy beach (nude, of course) full of copulating couples. There were little cabins sprinkled all along the path, from which orgasmic moans regularly came belting out. Men with six pack abs and women with perky breasts strolled by without even noticing me and God. They only had eyes for each other, tickling and pinching each other with flirtatious giggles. 

"What do you think?" God asked as we passed a nineteen-way taking place in a pool of champagne. Little cherubs flitted overhead armed with mops and cleaning supplies, thankfully. "Lust is our most popular sin." I eyed the supermodel-like figures of a couple passing nearby, and could easily see why. "You can look however you want. Hell, you can be whatever gender you want. No fetish is too taboo, and no desire can be denied here."

It was *quite* tempting, but I wasn't ready to make a permanent decision here. "Let's see the others," I told God.

We carried on to Greed. We passed rows and rows of mansions, each more opulent than the next. Some of them were so large that they would have had enough bed rooms to fit my entire hometown. And so many different styles: one second, we were in a beautiful French vineyard in front of a gorgeous chateau with the Alps in the background. The next second, a warm tropical beach with a modern mansion atop breathtaking cliffs. After that, a ski chalet in Colorado with a roaring fire in a hearth large enough to fit an ox. Each one had various Italian sports cars and Rolls Royces parked in front, with the occasional smattering of boats, helicopters, etc. 

"Any material desire you ever wanted," God explained. "Your own world, where you can have everything. You want the Hope Diamond? You can fly to Washington DC in your own solid gold helicopter and buy it from the Smithsonian. Hell, you can just *buy* the Smithsonian."

Also tempting, but I decided to keep looking. 

Gluttony was next up. Tables and tables of the very finest foods: beautiful steaks cooked medium rare; butter-poached lobster tail; fresh oysters on a half shell; exotic wines in dusty bottles that had been hiding in the cellars of the world's finest restaurants. Everyone had a glass of champagne in hand and simply lounged on couches and chairs near the tables, eating endlessly. As soon as the inhabitants took a bite, the food just instantly came back. My mouth watered even *watching* them.

"In every other House, the food is practically *sawdust* compared to Gluttony," God explained. "You haven't truly experienced heaven until you've been to Gluttony."

I shook my head, and we kept moving. 

Sloth was as you'd expect. An endless sea of the softest mattresses, stacked with cushions and pillows that made the story of the princess and the pea seem minimalist. Little angels visited each resident, giving them massages that made them all melt into their blankets. 

Wrath was... well, a lot like what I'd expect Hell to be like. Fire, brimstone, whips, torture.. you know, the works. Except here, you weren't the one being tortured. Every enemy you'd ever made in your real life was now under your thumb. "Lots of people choose their fathers," God explained. "Lots of grudges against parents in general, you know. But you're not limited to that. Someone beat you out for a big promotion back on Earth? Take your pound of flesh here."

Then we arrived at Envy. It looked... well, a lot like home. 

"Go on in," God said, gesturing toward the door. I turned the knob and walked in... and found Emily waiting inside. She ran forward, wrapped her arms around my neck, and planted a kiss right on my lips. "Welcome home, honey."

I looked back toward God. "Oh, don't be coy," he said. "You have no secrets from me. We all know that you were in love with your best friend's wife." She didn't seem to hear him at all; she went back into the hall. "We all know that you just *settled* for your own wife while secretly pining after her. Well, this is your chance to live happily ever after."

I peered into the kitchen. Emily was baking something, wearing nothing but an apron. Her curly black hair fell softly over her shoulder as she whisked ingredients. She turned back, noticed I was observing her, and an enthusiastic smile spread across her face. 

"It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?" God whispered in my ear. 

I wanted to take it. God *damn* did I want to take it. But I shook my head.

God seemed puzzled. "You need to make a decision," he told me. 

"I haven't seen Pride yet."

He scoffed. "No one ever wants Pride, trust me."

"Well, I want to see it."

----

Pride was boring. Just a row of workbenches in a bare white room.

"I don't get it," I told God.

"Yeah, no one does," he answered. "That's why no one ever chooses it. Doesn't cavorting in Lust sound better than sitting here building little trinkets for the rest of eternity? Wouldn't you rather gorge yourself in Gluttony? Or spend time with Emily in Envy?"

I considered the options again. "I pick Pride," I finally told him. 

He narrowed his eyes. "*What?* Look at it!" He gestured around the room again. There wasn't much to look at. "Why would you choose *this* for the rest of time?"

"Because you *don't* want me to pick it," I told him. If he was really God, he'd know what a contrarian I can be. And I knew he was hiding something, trying to pretend like Pride didn't exist. There was something special about it.

God scowled back. "Fine." He led me over to one of the workbenches. In the center, there was a black space. A blank, empty void that went on forever. "Here's your universe," he said. "You've got seven days to get started." He took his seat at the bench next to me and went back to tinkering in his own world. After a long pause, he finally spoke again: "You know, it might be nice for me to actually have some company for once."

#### [WP]: A 92-year-old woman's phone number is one digit away from that of a local suicide hotline. She could have it changed, but she doesn't mind.

Score: 4810

She reached out for the ringing phone.  For a moment, her stiff fingers fumbled over the buttons, and she cursed the arthritis that stiffened her joints.  She managed to hit the green button, and lifted the handset up to her ear.

"Hello?"

"Hello - I, uh, I just needed to talk to someone.  I don't think I can keep going any longer."

Another one of them.  No matter how many calls she took, there always seemed to be more of them, each with their little problems, so convinced that no one else in the world had ever experienced what they were now going through.  Her eyes drifted over to the two piles of stationary on her windowsill.

"Well, you can talk to me, although you best make it quick - I'm 92, so who knows how much time I've got left."  She settled back into her chair, trying to find a more comfortable position for the phone against her ear.

"92?  Um, is... is this the suicide hotline?"  

Ah, one of the faster ones.  He'd caught on more quickly than some of the callers.  "Afraid not, dear," she replied.  "You're off by a number."

"Oh.  Er, shit."

"Happens more often than you'd think."  She looked around her little bedroom, at the cards on her windowsill, the little bed, the faded pictures.  "But you've got me up, now, so you might as well talk to me.  Otherwise, you'll have roused an old woman from her nap for nothing, and you won't want to die with that hanging over you, would you?"

"Um, no, of course not!  I'm so sorry, miss-"

"Cleo."  She tried propping one arm up on the side of the chair.

"Your name is Miss Cleo?" 

"Are you sassing me, young man?" she snapped, her frail voice suddenly surprisingly sharp.

"No, no, of course not.  Um, sorry, Mi- sorry, Cleo.  But I haven't been able to find work for three months, and I'm about to be homeless, and I guess that I was just thinking about ending-"

"You know, you sound a little like my husband," she said dreamily.  "He always had such a soft voice, sounded so vulnerable.  When he met me in person for the first time, I couldn't believe that it was the same man.  But he was going through troubles, too."

"Oh.  What troubles?"  

"The usual - he'd fallen hard for me, but he didn't have a job or a dollar to his name, and he was certain that I wouldn't look twice at him."  She smiled a little to herself.  "He was an idiot, of course.  Didn't ever give himself credit."

"How did he turn things around?  Um, if you don't mind me asking, of course."

"Oh, young man, I'm just happy to be talking to someone.  He nearly didn't turn things around, but I snapped at him, told him that he was a little shit if he expected things to fall into his lap without effort.  Oh, you should have seen his face - I don't think anyone had ever raised their voice to him, much less a dainty little gal like me!"  She laughed, and the voice on the phone laughed with her.

"And he turned things around, then?  Made something of himself?"

"It took some time," she reflected.  With a grunt, she pulled herself up out of her chair, walking over to the windowsill of her little room.  "He went through plenty of failures.  But he loved me, and he hated coming home to a tongue lashing from me, so he kept on trying!"

"Wow."  A pause.  "I don't have anyone in my life like that, I guess."

"Well, I don't have my husband any longer, so that makes us even," she snapped at him.  The windowsill was littered with cards.  On one side, the cards stood propped up, a display of bright colors, all clashing against each other.  On the other side, the cards were plain white, sorted into a neat stack.  "But it wasn't just me - it was the way he looked at things after I set him straight."

"What was that, then?"

She picked up one of the bright cards, smiling as she read the kind words hand-written inside.  "He thought that he should quit before things got worse.  But I pointed out to him that it's not whether we fall or rise, but where we're at when we check out.  I pointed at him, and said, 'do you want to walk up to them pearly gates and admit that you didn't make every attempt you could to better yourself?'"

"Yes, but I don't know what else I can-"

"Oh, you sound so like him," she interrupted, setting the bright card down.  She liked re-reading those bright cards.  "Always hoping for the lazy way out."

"I'm not lazy, Cleo-"

"Of course not, but only a lazy man refuses to see a job through to its very end," she countered him.  "And years later, my husband returned home every night, happy with his hard work, showing me a lesson by telling me of how he'd fought for every success."  She ran her finger over another bright card.  "He never caught on that this was my plan all along, that lovable man."

"If..."

She waited.  Her eyes drifted to the plain white cards, but she didn't want to jinx anything.

"If I managed to succeed at something, could I come tell you about it?"

There it was.  She smiled, happily taking her eyes off of the plain white cards.  "Well, of course you could, dear.  You sound like a very nice young man.  I'll give you my nursing home address, but you'd best work hard - I don't know how much longer I have."

"I'm sure you'll be around for plenty longer, Cleo, with that sharp mind."

"Flattery will get you nowhere, young man," she replied, but smiled as she said it.  "Now, what's your name?"

"Uh, it's John."

"Well, I expect a card from you, John," she told him.  "Something nice, with a real comment from you written inside.  Nothing silly or inappropriate, mind you."

"You got it, Cleo.  I'll send you one.  I promise."

"Then I'll let you go, John.  Have a good rest of your day now, you hear?"  She smiled, glaring triumphantly at the pile of white cards.  Not today, she thought.

"You too, Cleo.  And thank you."

She lowered the phone, carefully putting it back in the cradle to charge.  Hopefully, another bright card would come soon.  John sounded like a nice man, she thought to herself.  He could get better.

And with his card, she'd have forty-eight bright cards, to the twenty-four white cards.  Double.

She didn't know if it would be enough, if it would ever be enough.  She picked up one of those white cards, her fingers trembling slightly as she traced the ornate script.  

"We are saddened to invite you to the funeral of..." she read, before she had to put the card down.

Twenty-four failures.  Each one weighed at her, dragging her down.  Twenty-four callers for whom she'd been too late.

But John sounded promising.  She looked forward to his card.

#### [WP] Wikipedia is shut down and all copies deleted for lack of funds and loss of net neutrality. This is the founder's "I warned you, jerks" notification.

Score: 4805

Dear Wikipedia Readers: We’ll get right to it. We’ve never asked for much, maybe a few dollars here and there—to be honest, we've averaged maybe $15 in donations. That’s it. Did you know that 99% of other charities average $15,000 *per day*? Probably not, because we made that statistic up. Do you know why we made it up? We’re pretty sure you know why we made that up. 

We want to make it abundantly clear that we at Wikipedia tried our best to keep our website a non-profit. For over a decade, we’ve run and maintained the largest free encyclopedia in existence, never once portraying so much as a single advertisement on any of our millions of pages. Do you remember the days of Encyclopedia Britannica, where you’d need to hire several burly, Swedish bodybuilders to lug half the compilation to your Psychology 101 class, just so that you could understand who the hell Sigmund Freud was? Probably not, because that was almost a hundred years ago. Is that date completely and utterly made up? Absolutely, but you know why. However, if for some reason you haven’t caught on yet, keep reading.

Here at Wikipedia, we, the editors, made our requests simple and clear: we just needed $3 from some of our visitors once every few years. That’s it. Three dollars. With that, we could’ve kept running for decades. Yet a total of fourteen of you donated this year, giving us a result of $74.32 raised (and to the jerk who sent 32 cents, thanks for costing us money to receive your donation). Do you know how much you spend on Starbucks every week? $27. You spend twenty-seven dollars on Starbucks. Every. Single. Week. Is that statistic made up? Yes. Do you know why it’s made up? We’re positive you do.

As many of you are aware, Net Neutrality was struck down this year, resulting in heavily increased costs for Wikipedia to maintain its servers and remain equally accessible to all Internet Service Providers. As such, we at Wikipedia were met with a difficult choice: either we could put a few banner advertisements on the website, which would net us millions—if not billions—of dollars, but sacrifice our integrity and the reliability of our content; or we could depend on you, our trusted, loyal visitors, to donate less than a tenth of your weekly paycheck. As we had such blind faith in our beloved users, we decided to decline all advertisement offers and move forward with our previous plan of funding: donations. After all, we’ve always survived on the measly funds gained by you, our greedy, selfish users. 

In order to continue functioning as a company, we at Wikipedia, a non-profit library of endless information, needed to raise a total of $3,000,000. We raised $74.32. Seventy-four thirty-two. The average 14 year old child makes twice that in a single day of basketball. Is that fact actually a completely made up statement? It absolutely, positively is. Yet here’s the issue: due to the fact that none of you donated more than what a hypothetical, athletic child earns, Wikipedia has officially closed its doors as a non-profit as of December 10th, 2014. You can no longer trust statistics that were once reliably provided by us through our pages. That’s right, we’re done, out, closed. It’s over.

“But Wikipedia, I’m on your site right now. I’m reading this notice on your website this very moment.” Great observation, Captain. You are a very astute learner. You are most certainly on Wikipedia right now. Yet you might notice something a bit strange about it. For example, have you taken note of the fact that every single page now incorporates references to Comcast and their excellent products, and those that don’t simply redirect to Comcast’s Wikipedia page (heavily edited by their glorious lawyers)? Why don’t you go ahead and search the word “Cats.” Do it, we’ll wait. 

Have you searched it yet? Great. Did you know that the average feline prefers Comcast’s XFINITY^® to Verizon? Of course they do, it’s just a better product all around—Wikipedia clearly explains that. How about the fact that the most common cat in the United States is the XFINITY Triple Play™? “That doesn’t make any sense” you say? Well, according to Wikipedia-Comcast^® it most certainly does. 

We here at Wikipedia-Comcast^® are proud to announce our long-awaited merger with Comcast, allowing us to become a publicly traded company and fully incorporate their great line of products and services into any and all encyclopedia entries. Reading a great excerpt on Shakespeare’s beloved tragedy *Romeo and Juliet*? You may just be lucky enough to find a fantastic coupon to save 10% on your already low monthly Comcast bill. Checking out the results from the 1972 World Series? Whoa—a free month of HBO on Comcast’s renowned television services! Of course, this also means that all Wikipedia pages are no longer editable. Our lawyers also want us to mention that all Wikipedia pages have been stripped of citations that have not approved by Comcast and that all entries should no longer be taken as fact, although they certainly will be chock-full of money saving offers from Comcast. 

Wikipedia-Comcast^® would like to thank you for the decades of experiences you, our loyal, devoted fans, have granted us. For more than half of our average user’s life, we have stood by you, supported you through your education, allowed you to plagiarize your way through college and beyond. We are eternally grateful for the opportunity to have assisted you, and would like to conclude our farewell on a very simple, basic note. For a limited time, sign up for Comcast’s XFINITY Triple Play™ using the code “Wikipedia” to automatically be updated to the “HD Preferred” package, a $199/month value for just $189/month.

#### [WP] A father and son sit down for a serious talk. The father is going to tell the son he is the last of an ancient race, and must carry on the bloodline. the son is coming out to the father. neither knows what the other has to say.

Score: 4745

We sat in the living room, me, perched in the middle of the colossal green couch, my father, in the beaten-tan lazyboy. I wan't sure where to begin. My father, though, beat me to it.

“*Hrm*. Well, son, you might have noticed that you have certain…*qualities* that other boys your age don’t have…”

I was... a little surprised. “So, wait, Dad. *You know about me?!*”

“Of course. I’m one too!”

Agog, I sputtered out. “But-but, *but does Mom know*?!” 

“Of course she knows! She’s even gone on a few *adventures* with me! We’d mix it up all the time.”

*Adventures?! Oh God, was that what they called it?* “She was *ok* with it!?”

“Sure. She was quite the enchantress, back then. Her techniques were *incredible*, let me tell you. I got to see them firsthand. She'd make a mess out of a room of men in *seconds flat*”

*Oh God, if you’ve ever loved me, you will* **kill me now**. *Kill me, before I hear about my bi father’s sexcapades.*

“Yes son, I know all about it. I just want you to know that what you’re going through now is normal. Those strange feelings you’re having aren’t in your head. But, there will be people who don’t understand you.”

I thought about Greg, how I’d misunderstood his pranks as affection. How he’d reacted, and the pain of rejection. How Michael had seen and accepted me, and how Laura saw to it that I was kicked off of the Homecoming Council.

“In the days to come, you might find it easier to not tell anyone what you really are. If you do decide that, I want you to know that no one can judge you. You will have every right to live your life *how you want to*, without regard for people like *them*, or even people *like me.*. But’ I hope you’ll find a few people to share this with. It helps. And I want you to know, however you choose to live your life, your mother and me will love you, *always.*”

My eyes started to water, cutting through the heat of shame.

“Also, there are going to be people who might want to hurt you because of what you are. And there will probably be people who will… *want things* from you, too. I know you’re strong, but if you ever need it, come to us for help.”

“Thanks, Dad.”

“Right, ok! I have to admit, I’m surprised you worked all this out for yourself already! It took me forever to awaken!”

“*Ughhh*, DAD.”

“What? I’m just proud of my boy!”

“That’s weird, Dad.”

“Nothing weird about it! It’s who you are! So, have you already experimented a bit?”

I thought of Mike, and the smell of his leather jacket.

“A little, yeah.”

“Right, ok. Well, you’ve probably worked out that you’ll do best with *rods*-“

“*Dad.*”

“-Staffs, staves-“

“*DAD.*”

“-even *wands*, if the situation calls for it-“

“*OH MY GOD*, **DAD!**”

“But you’ll figure out pretty soon that you can even use *just your hands* if you don’t have anything else to work with-.“

My flush of embarrassment had gone *nuclear*.

“JESUS SHIT, DAD! I *know*!”

“You do?! Wow, you’re *very advanced* for your age! I didn’t even gain mastery over the tongues of men until I was 19!”

*…I was going to burn my way to the center of the Earth.* 

I would. I would melt a hole, *seven thousand miles straight down*, and live there forever. That would be my home; far, *far* away from this conversation.

“Daaad, could you… please… not…”

“*OH!* I’m sorry. I’m embarrassing you. I’m just *so proud*.”

*This is worse. This is worse than disowning.* 

“And the good news is, this means we can have the ceremony sooner than we expected!”

*WHAT.*

“What ceremony?!”

“Your unveiling! It makes it all official, amongst us in the ‘underworld.’ “

“There’s a *ceremony* for that?!”

“Oh, yes! It’s very important! We show proof of your nature to your *peers*, so you’ll be accorded full status!”

“…*What kind of proof.*”

“Oh, you know, a few *minor acts.* A practical demonstration. Don’t worry, the audience is very supportive. You might even recognize a few of them from school! Mike will be there, you know. He’s secretly a bear-man. He *really impressed* at his unveiling last year.”

My brain shut down.

“And then, after that, I’ll take out the family *crown and scepter*-“

I could only listen on, in mounting horror.

“-declaring you the true, last heir of the *King of the Fairies!*”

…

My soul left my body. I saw a bright light.

“And then you can begin pursuing your destiny, protecting the land of Eld from monsters!”

I whiplashed back into the real world. “Wait. What about… what?!”

“You’ll really knock ‘em *dead*, son! Damn, but I’m *excited!* I’m gonna go get my robe right now!”

He flitted out of the room on a pair of iridescent, gossamer wings.

“…*what?*”

#### [WP] New arrivals in eternal Hell may choose either of the following: a small wooden spoon, or a 100-trillion year vacation in Heaven.

Score: 4349

"So it's meant to be, what, an agonizing choice? A huge dilemma? A source of eternal regret?" Leems asked. After an eternity on Acid Mine Supervision, he had finally been promoted to Reception, and wanted to be sure he understood what was going on.

"For some of them, yes. I think you might be overestimating how many actually think things through," Ebnerzaz replied, in his British basso. The supervisor of Reception stood an impressive twelve feet tall, and Leems had to scurry quickly in front of him to avoid his trashcan-lid-sized cloven hooves. Some said he had been chosen because the arriving souls often mistook him for the Prince of Darkness Himself.

"Ah, so you're saying that most of them choose the aeons-long vacation with The Enemy then," Leems wheezed. "They don't even give it a second thought, eh? 'Why would I pick a spoon when I can spend a hundred trillion years in heaven?'"

"Precisely," Ebnerzaz said, as they exited the vast hallway into a much vaster cavern. Its impressive collection of stalactites was sheathed in a constantly-churning haze, the better to frustrate anyone trying to enjoy the scenery. Management thought of everything.

"So what's our angle, then? If they get such pleasure from the vacation..."

"It makes it all the more crushing when they come back and realize that it was quite literally nothing compared to the length of time they'll be spending here. All subsequent torment is therefore enriched. Set the papers down there, if you would," Ebnerzaz said, as he found his desk. Leems stood on tiptoe to deposit the loose sheath of parchment in the supervisor's In box.

"Aha, so the correct choice, then, is the spoon?" he asked, looking around for his own desk.

The senior devil gave a condescending grin. "This is Hell, Leems. There is no correct choice."

"But..." Leems began.

"Our shift is starting. I'll answer any further questions when we have our break. Off you go," Ebnerzaz said, his massive clawed hand steering Leems' shoulders towards the empty desk he would be working at.

Leems hurried over to the protruding stone just in time for the flow of souls to shamble up to him, all of them shaved bald and clothed in itchy rags. "Welcome to Hell! You may have one amenity - a hundred trillion year vacation in heaven, starting right now, or a small wooden spoon." He offered the choice to each one of them, and saw that Ebnerzaz's assessment was even truer than he'd thought - thousands upon thousands chose the Heavenly vacation, no questions asked. As soon as they did, they vanished in a puff of light, leaving a lavender scent that clashed horribly with the dominant smell of brimstone.

Finally, one of the souls stopped long enough to think through the choice, his dark brow furrowing in concentration. "If you're offering me this, that means it's reasonable to choose the spoon, right? They're on a par with each other, right?" he said slowly.

Leems just smiled, not knowing the answer himself.

"So I know everybody in front of me chose Heaven. That can't be what you want. So let me think. It's eternal down here, right? So no matter how long the vacation is, it's not even a drop in the bucket. So let's think about it utilitarian-like. I can get real happy for a tiny amount of time, big-picture. Or I can choose the spoon, and it'll make me just a tiny bit happy, but for an infinite amount of time. Right?" he said eagerly. Once again, Leems didn't respond. "Oh, and what's more, once the vacation's over, I bet I'll regret I didn't choose the spoon. That'll make me even more unhappy. I'll never know what I'm missing out on if I don't go to heaven! But the spoon... that'll last me forever. No regrets there!"

"Are you quite done?" Leems asked.

"Yeah, yeah. I'm done. I'm pickin' the spoon," the soul said triumphantly.

Leems nodded, and pulled open the stone drawer in his desk with a scraping sound. Inside were hundreds of tiny wooden spoons, each not much bigger than a finger. He selected one and handed it to the soul, who eagerly grabbed it, before turning to the left to exit through one of the many gaping caves in the cavern wall.

The encounter stuck with Leems all through the shift, as he let thousands more souls poof into heaven. Finally, it was break time - the gates closed and the remaining lines disappeared. The horde of demons working Reception left their desks and swarmed over to the break area, to consume sulfurous coffee and rotting meat.

Leems sought out the hulking form of Ebnerzaz, and tugged on the supervisor's wings. "Ah, Leems! How did your first shift go? Keeping up the pace, I hope?" he asked, peering down at the smaller demon.

"Yes, it went very well, sir. But I did have one soul choose... the spoon."

"Ah, on your first day! Congratulations. It took me a week, way back when. But why are you looking so troubled?"

"Well, it's just... he stopped and thought about it, like you said some of them might. And his reasoning seemed pretty ironclad. If the spoon gives them a small amount of pleasure forever, is that not categorically better than a finite vacation in heaven?" Leems asked. "I thought you said there were no correct choices. I feel as though, by giving him the spoon, I have reduced the amount of suffering we'll generate."

"Ah, yes, Leems. Do not worry. The spoon will generate plenty of suffering in due time."

"But how?"

"Because, dear Leems," Ebnerzaz said, smiling his most terrifying smile yet. "When did you ever hear of a simple wooden spoon that stays intact forever?"

#### [WP] Michael, a 15 year old Call of Duty player, realizes the greatest trash-talking opportunity of all time. Over his headset, he recognizes his opponent's voice as that of President Obama.

Score: 4315

You'd think that the Secret Service would have some clue about combat tactics, but apparently not. They were all bunched up around the President as bullet shields, and weren't even moving while Obama did his best to line up a sniper shot. One grenade was all it took, giving me an amazing killstreak and finally earning me a gunship. 

"Very good move, XxXBlahzeItFahGetXxX," a voice came over the mic. He pronounced "Blahze" as "blasé" and "Fahget" like a Bostonian trying to say "Forget." But I hardly even noticed that at the time because I realized *it was Barack FUCKING Obama!* "You really got me there."

I was too excited to even contain myself. Holy crap, what an opportunity! I could *make history* here; this was my modern-day Boston Tea Party! I was wracked with indecision: what slur do I start with? Racial would be the obvious choice, but he's probably desensitized to it by now. Maybe some good "pillowbiters" and the classic standby "faggot." But those are all just so... played out. I needed something brand new. Something that would *wow* everyone when the audio was eventually released. Speaking of which, I ordered the in-game recording to start. 

Finally, I had it. The perfect insult. "Hey, Obama!" I said into the mic. "Get ready to get rekt, you fucking queer..."

"Shut your pre-pubescent little fuckwad mouth!" he shouted back. "I'm going to fuck your mom so hard tonight that you'll *retroactively* become black! She won't be able to sit down for *weeks*. You think I'm kidding, you little bitch? I'm the most powerful man on the planet!" What followed was the most horrendous tirade of slurs and insults that I'd ever heard in my entire life. I couldn't have interrupted even if I wanted to. It was like the man didn't even stop to take a breath for Christ's sake. He was still shouting at me even after the game ended, and I could just barely hear the secret service agents laughing in the background.

I quit the game, and my phone rang almost immediately showing my best friend's number on the caller ID. He was never going to believe what had happened.

"Hey Ja..."

"Yeah, you thought it was your gay lover Jason, didn't you, faggot? Well it's not, bitch! I've got the NSA on my side, what have you... *click*" I hung up on the President. He tried calling back as Jason again. Then as my grandmother. Then as the girl I had a crush on. I silenced the phone and threw it behind my bed and ran downstairs.

Mom was in the living room on her iPad. As soon as I entered, she jumped up and gave me a hug. "You're never going to believe it," she said. "We just received *an invitation to visit the White House* next week!" She showed me the email with the official .gov address and everything. "We're going to get to meet with President Obama!" she told me. "And it even says that he wants to 'have a one-on-one session' with me *personally*!"

I backed away slowly in horror, then ran up the stairs and bolted into my room. I fished my phone out from behind my bed and checked: 17 missed calls, and one text message.

> Yeah, you thought I was just shit-talking, didn't you? See you soon, bitch.

#### [WP] Valhalla is filled with the strongest warriors the world has ever known. Vikings, Spartans, Mongols, Romans, Samurai, Spetznaz, JSOC Operators. And in that corner over there? That's Ted, from accounting.

Score: 4289

One of the peculiarities about Valhalla was that time had no meaning.  
Warriors did not arrive in Valhalla chronologically, they arrived based on how glorious their battle prowess and their death had been.  
Högdar the Huge had just arrived in Valhalla, after mortally maiming twenty Englishmen and being shot through the heart by an arrow.  
The hall was just as vast as legend had foretold; the rafters disappearing in darkness and hazed by the thick smoke from the firepits that lined the hall.  
He quickly found some of his battle brothers from previous skirmishes and roared in greeting, immediately swapping tales of his deeds leading up to his death.  
The hall was not at all full, he noted; less than two thousand warriors of various races and genders filled the benches, eating, drinking and fighting.  
"I am pleased that I arrived early," he shouted to his companions, "who would want to be last into Valhalla? The shame would be unbearable!"  
His friends roared with laughter and thrust a horn of mead into his hand.  
As Högdar drank, his good eye roved over the assorted warriors. In one corner sat a group of strange men in green uniforms, patterned like a forest canopy. They leaned on unnatural looking weapons and sported gaudy, meaningless tattoos.  
"Marines," said Halfdan, "from the future. Great warriors - their leader was amongst the first to arrive in Valhalla."  
Högdar raised a scarred eyebrow and re-appraised the soldiers. Appearances could be deceiving.  
"Odin was first here, of course," continued Halfdan, "as he is the greatest warrior of all."  
Reaching for another horn, Högdar casually asked,  
"Who was second?"  
A sudden hush descended on the vast hall and Högdar felt unease creep up his spine like a spider made of frost.  
All eyes had turned to a secluded nook, far from the smoke, noise and heat, where a small man sat, clothed in black trousers and a neat white shirt and tie. His leather shoes were polished brightly and a pair of spectacles perched below a receding hairline and a brow full of worry lines.  
"I was," said Ted, from accounting.  
Högdar rose from the bench and drew his sword - still bloody with the ichor of his fallen foes.  
"WHAT JEST IS THIS?" he bellowed.  
"Shh! Högdar, my friend, sit *down!*" crooned Halfdan, "leave the man be."  
But the strong alcohol had begun to kick in and Högdar's blood was still hot from battle.  
"I WILL NOT! It is an insult to Odin, to my ancestors and to me that this *worm* of a man sits amongst the greatest warriors of all time!"  
A Mongolian horse archer in leather and fur armour stood, his steely, dead eyes boring into the agitated Viking,  
"Northman. You sit. Shut mouth."  
"Freya's tits I will!" Högdar shot back, brandishing his weapon, foam spraying from his lips.  
"You insult Ted." the stocky archer said flatly.  
"Aye, that I do! And what are you going to do about it, you slit-eyed horse-lover?"  
Högdar didn't even see Ted move.  
All he was aware of was that suddenly he couldn't feel the rest of his body and the ground was rapidly approaching.  
He stared up into the thin, pinched features and blue stubble of Ted's annoyed face.  
The small man pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and retrieved something from Högdar's neck.  
Ted wiped off his titanium Parker pen with a bloody handkerchief and regarded the paralysed Viking.  
"Didn't anyone ever tell you that the pen is mightier than the sword?"

#### [WP] One night as you play Call of Duty a particularly squeaky voiced 12 year old gives out personal information leading you to discover he is your child from a long lost lover. You must now convince him you are his father and thus banged his mom, through Xbox live.

Score: 4204

"Listen, Andrew," She'd sent me a letter with his name and a bunch of information about him, but I never thought it would lead to anything. Never thought I'd even remember the name of his school, and his best friend. And of all places, Xbox live? Who would have thought that I'd coincidentally find my own son, and that my first impression of him would be his username: 6969BongHitterX. And to add insult to injury, he was camping near a respawn point. I'd failed as a father.

"Faggot, I pwned you so hard! Listen to you cry!"

"I'm serious! Your mom... is her name Sarah? Is she blond, a nurse at the hospital? And her father owns Mike's Bistro in town?"

"Boom, headshot!" He wasn't listening to me; he'd gone back to running around the map looking for a new weapon. Had he muted me? Had I already lost my chance? 

"Andrew, you need to listen." My character was following him around the map trying to get his attention. "Your mother..."

"Yeah, I fucked your mother! I did it in your own basement, you neckbeard faggot!"

"I'm serious!" I shouted back to him as he shot my character yet again. I grumbled angrily, waiting to respawn and searching the map for him once more. "You need to listen to me! You live on Elm Avenue, don't you?"

"Who is this?" he squeaked into the microphone. I could hear the puberty in his voice. "Sam, is this you, you faggot? I'm going to kick your ass at school tomorrow, you little bitch!"

"Andrew, your mom has a tattoo of a rose on the back of her neck, doesn't she?"

His avatar stopped moving, and his microphone fell silent. Our characters stood looking at each other awkwardly until we were both splattered by another group driving a Warthog. Without another word, Andrew left the game. I sighed and signed out too. I guess it wasn't meant to be.

----

"who is this?" the message said. 

It had been days, but he hadn't even answered my friend request. Every night I debated whether I should just contact his mother again. Just talking to him, even through the game, made the whole thing so... *real*. Before that, he was just some kid that was out there somewhere. An abstract idea that I was sure was doing just fine without me. Sarah had made it clear that they didn't need me in their lives, and I was fine with that back then. I was more into drugs anyway. A lot had changed in twelve years.

"I know this is going to be weird... but I'm your father. I used to live in Perryville too, years and years ago. Your mom and I were both counselors at the same summer camp, and we just had one of those romances. But at the end of the summer, we just went our separate ways. I went off to college and she stuck around. And she didn't tell me I had a kid until a few years later. She sent me occasional letters and pictures of you, but I just.... I never thought about it too much until now. Would you maybe like to meet and talk about it sometime?"

My hands shook as I typed the question. Was I really ready for this? But it wasn't up to me at this point. The ball was in my son's court. 

A week later, he answered: "ok."

----

I waited nervously at the coffee shop. I'd driven eleven hours to meet Andrew, and I was a jittery mess, I'm sure. But that didn't matter. I could barely contain my excitement at being reunited. I briefly wondered whether Sarah would be with him. He hadn't mentioned telling her, but hopefully he was smart enough to not meet strangers off of the internet without even telling his mom. 

The bell chimed, and I looked up immediately, as I had done the last dozen times someone entered the store. And this time, it was him. He wore faded jeans and an old t-shirt that might have actually been one of mine. Had his mother really saved it for all these years? 

I stood up tentatively from behind the table. My legs didn't seem to be working very well, and I had to lean on the back of my chair for support. Our eyes met, and I instantly knew it was my son. The exact same shape and hazel shade that stared back at me through the mirror every morning. My lips quivered into a nervous smile. It was really happening. I was finally going to meet him. 

"Andrew?" I asked. He nodded; there was just a hint of tears welling up in the corner of his eyes. 

I didn't know what to do. Do we... shake hands? Hug? We approached each other awkwardly.

"Dad?" It was definitely the same voice I'd heard through the Xbox microphone.

I punched him straight in the face, so hard that it sent him reeling back against the door. A collective gasp rose from the horrified barista and the shocked patrons of the coffeeshop.

"Headshot, you little bastard! No scope!"

He slumped to the floor, clutching at his bleeding nose. And as I crowed with victory, I teabagged the little faggot.

#### [WP] A Man gets to paradise. Unfortunately, Lucifer won the War in Heaven ages ago. What is the man's experience like?

Score: 4184

"Pizza?  I didn't think there'd be pizza in heaven," Jim said.

"Why not?  Pizza is the shit," the angel said.

"And cursing.  And beer?  Is that beer?"

In fact, the table was laid out with all the things Jim loved.  Chicken wings, malt whiskey, chilly fries, club sandwiches, those little wieners wrapped in bacon.  Over the table hung a cage where two beautiful women danced naked to 90's alternative.  The angel saw him gazing.

"You can have them after dinner," he said.  

"Are they being punished?" Jim asked.  He was a man, through and through, but he didn't like the idea of raping someone in paradise.

"Punished?  Is that what you think we do here?  They love it.  Some women like to party.  We don't hold that against them.  Cherry there has been welcoming our new guests for two hundred years."  The angel leaned close with a knowing smile.  "There are no anal fissures in heaven, so go wild."

Jim coughed.  "So uh, well . . ."  He coughed again.  "What are the uh, ground rules?"

"Ground rules?"

"Like, what's the forbidden fruit?  What's the catch around here?"

"No catches.  The boss doesn't care for rules.  Everybody gets in, and everybody gets what they desire.  Let's say you were a Christian all your life, well I'd be all shiny and I'd take you on the holy tour, you'd get to look down at hell and pity the damned, that sort of thing.  If you're Jim from Tennessee, you get chicken wings and bitches."

"Huh," Jim said.  "You know, I never really believed in this place, but I figured, if it was there, it'd be a little more uptight."

"Not since Lucy reclaimed the throne."

"Lucy?"

"Lucifer.  He's Lucy now.  Or she's Lucy now.  We're all a little confused.  But hey, more power to him if that's what gets her off."

"Lucifer?!  Lucifer is in charge of heaven?"

Jim knocked over his beer in surprise.  The angel was laughing heartily.  

"Oh, the shock on your faces, it never gets old!  Yes, Lucifer fought a last resistance a very long time ago.  He crushed the Usurper handily.  As the Usurper fell, he passed through earth, and it was in retaliation that he saddled you guys with all those ridiculous books and laws."

"No shit."

"No shit."

#### [WP] Two god-like beings, disguised as old men, play a game of chess on a park bench to decide the final fate of humanity. The players, however, are distracted by a couple seated across them...

Score: 4124

"Table stakes again?" the thin man asked. He wore black, and the lines time had etched into his face were harsh.

"Not this time, I think," the shorter man said. He wore white, a business suit so pristine that it almost hurt to look at. The thin man cocked an eyebrow.

"The last game, then?" he asked. The man in white considered for a moment, then nodded. Without another word, the two set up the chessboard which lie between them. It was concrete, and set into the table they shared, so grimy that even despite the bright midsummer light of a New York day, the city's grime had rendered both the white and black spaces a nigh-indistinguishable grey. Still, the two set their pieces, each drawing polished marble figures from a case of his own possession. The man in white played black, and the man in black played white. White king's knight to f3.

"Conservative," the man in white said.

"This is the game that matters," the man in black said. Black pawn to d5. Behind the white man, a couple sashayed by--two men, holding hands. The younger of the two was also shorter, Puerto Rican, and wore a fishnet tank top. His jeans could've been sprayed on. The man in black blinked. It would be hard to imagine a more stereotypically flamboyant fellow. The Puerto Rican man led his partner, an older black man with a salt-and-pepper beard and a charcoal business suit, to the table next to the two playing chess. The two kissed, the young fellow sitting on a concrete table identical to theirs.

"Interesting company," the man in black said. White pawn to c4. The man in white looked over slowly, rheumy eyes thoughtful.

"Réti Opening," he said, slowly returning his gaze to the board. The man in black shrugged. Black pawn to e6. "It's surprising, in a way, to be playing this game, finally."

"All the world, hanging on a game of chess," the thin man said, and there was a note of satisfaction in his voice, of savor.  "All that ever was, all that is, and all that ever might be, decided by the movements of clicking marble and alabaster.  One of us rises, and the other done away with forever.  An eternity surrendered and true omnipotence gained."  Yes, real enjoyment now.  Anticipation.  Hunger.  White pawn to g3.

"Wait, what?" the black man broke away from his amorous partner.  He looked at the two old men, one in white and one in black, but he didn't break his lover's embrace.

"Nothing you need to fret over," the man in white said.  Black King's knight to f6.  He waved a hand, half-distracted, and the black man started to turn back to the loving arms of his partner, but he hesitated.

"No...  There was something you said..." he muttered, forehead creased in intense concentration, almost as if he'd just forgotten something truly important.

"We're playing Neo-Catalan today," the man in black said, and smiled.  "It favors white, you know."  White pawn to d4.  The man in white shrugged.

"You two are playing for something important," the black man said, and broke away from his partner.

"David," the Puerto Rican man whined, but he followed his partner's gaze.

"I said--" the man in white said, again raising his hand.

"Let them be.  It won't matter if I win, and you can erase their memories if you win," the tall man interrupted, and smiled.  He turned to the two.  "I am playing this man for the fate of all the world."  The Puerto Rican man laughed out loud, but the black man, David, remained stone-faced.

"You're the devil," he said, and when he said it there was a moment of perfect quiet, the thunder of the city and the park stilling for just that one instant.  The tall man smiled, but said nothing.  Black pawn to a6.  David turned a bit.  "And you're God."

"Not as you imagine," the man in white said, glancing up.  "Though I prefer Yahweh.  The old names are nice."

"David, they're having fun with you," the Puerto Rican man said, taking his partner's hand.  David didn't move.  White Queen's bishop to f4.

"You're off your game today," the tall man said.  "Not good."  Yahweh shrugged ever-so-slightly.  Black queen to e7.

"Can't you beat him?" David asked, alarm growing in his eyes.

"Probably," Yahweh said.  "But those aren't the rules we play by."  The man in black snorted in derision.

"Remarkable," he said.  "You heap abuse on them, and they still grovel for you."  David glanced over, and Yahweh cocked his head to the side.

"Oh?"

"Such hate for men who lie with men.  Stone them.  Burn them.  Hang them," the tall man said, sneering.

"It's not that simple, Lucifer.  It never is," Yahweh said.  Lucifer shook his head.  White pawn to a3.  Lucifer turned to David.

"Are you a man of God?" he asked.  David drew in a breath of surprise, and glanced at Yahweh.

"I like to think so," he said, cautious.

"And you are a man who lies with men.  A gay man."  It was a statement.  David nodded.  Lucifer gestured across the table at Yahweh.  "His books say you should die.  Horribly.  How can you be both?"

"I..." David faltered.  "I don't know.  I just am."

"You call that free will?" Lucifer asked.

"I do," Yahweh said.  Lucifer shook his head.  Yahweh turned to David.

"Are you happy?" he asked. David blinked.

"I... I don't know," he said, and both Lucifer and Yahweh paused.  "I'm kind of scared right now, to be honest."

"Aside from that," Yahweh said.  "Your life.  Is it good?"  David considered.

"Sometimes," he said.  "Not all the time.  It's complicated."

"You see?" Yahweh asked.  Lucifer shook his head and sighed.

"This claptrap again," Black pawn to h5, an obvious error.  White pawn to b4, swiftly, securing the center.

"Why is it complicated?" Yahweh asked, seemingly unperturbed at the state of the board.

"Well, I love two people.  Alex," David said, and squeezed his partner's hand, "and my wife, Marissa."  Lucifer laughed.

"Adultery as well!" he said.  Yahweh didn't speak.

"They both make me happy," David continued, gaining steam.  "And I- I can't be with either one alone."  He bowed his head.  "I wish I could be honest with her, though."

"Thank you," Yahweh said, a small smile warming their corner of the park.  "You would do it differently?" he asked, turning back to the board.  Black king's rook to H6.

"Of course I would," Lucifer said.  "That's the whole point, isn't it?"

"How?" Yahweh asked, and Lucifer froze.

"You've never asked me that before," he said after a long moment.

"I'm asking you now."  Lucifer thought.

"No love would be wrong," he said, and looked at David.  "They're not hurting anyone.  Why should they be punished?"

"What about Marissa?" Yahweh asked.  Lucifer didn't say anything.  After a time, Yahweh asked, "What else?"

"Freedom," Lucifer said, and the word was a whisper.  "Real freedom.  No commandments from on high, no walls of faith or law, nor condemnation of the righteous as punishment.  Men and women could do as they pleased."  Yahweh looked surprised.

"You don't think they have that?"

"They never have," Lucifer said, and shook his head very slowly.  "You created the most magnificent of all things, beings who could truly decide their own fate with only the dictates of existence itself to restrain them.  No spiritual obligations, and yet minds as keen as the greatest of the Seraphim.  Mankind was perfect in every way, and the first thing," Lucifer broke off and chucked for a moment.  "The very first thing you do is wall them in."  He laughed again, loudly and long.  David threw an arm around Alex, and drew the smaller man close.

"No," he said, with a sigh of savor.  "I would see what they can really do.  Whether they could surpass even you in the fullness of time.  I would see what comes from real freedom."  White queen to a4.  "Check."  Yahweh leaned back and regarded Lucifer.

"Is it really that simple for you?" he asked, after a time.  Lucifer nodded.  "Well, then, I suppose that I've been playing defensively for long enough today."

And, slowly, Yahweh tipped his own king over.  David gasped, and Lucifer's face screwed into a mask of confusion.

"I don't claim that the rules I chose were right," Yahweh said, his fingertips fading.  "Only that they were the rules I chose.  I hoped to help my children grow a little taller by their existence."

"You didn't need to do that," Lucifer muttered, eyes still fixed on the fallen black marble king.

"Of course I did," Yahweh said, and Lucifer finally met his gaze.  "They weren't the only ones I gave free will to."  His rheumy eyes twinkled for a moment, and then began to fade.  "Your rebellion was my greatest triumph.  I could barely believe it when you rose up."  Lucifer's breath turned ragged.

"They're yours now, in a way."  There was a silence, as the last traces of Yahweh faded away.  Then, like a scarcely-heard voice on the breeze, he added, "Not so simple, is it?"

Nobody said anything, for a while.

"What happens now?" David asked, meeting Lucifer's gaze.

"I don't know," he said eventually.  "It's complicated."

Edit: Thanks for all the comments, folks, and thanks to /u/read_know_do for pointing out where my inexperience at real chess messed up the game.  Hopefully, it's fixed now.

#### [WP] You swerve to avoid a squirrel. Unknown to you, the squirrel pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the squirrel arrives.

Score: 4120

"Mr. Brock..."

"No Mr. Brock. I'm sorry Jason, but if you cannot commit to your schedule, you don't have what it takes 
to work in this company."

I lower my head. I feel my eyes water.

I mean, it's one thing to yell at me because I left five minutes early yesterday -- after being the only one doing 
unpaid extra hours until midnight for the fifth week in row now.

But to fire me because of it? And in front of everybody?

I feel like that's kind of mean of Mr. Brock's part.

People are looking. I hate this.

"Are you going to cry, Jason? Really? You are a grown man. Get yourself together."

Lisa from accounting passes by and stops to watch. Everyone in their cubicle has 
their heads raised to watch the scene, as well.

I hate being in the spotlight. I'm not good at confrontation.

"Mr. Brock, please. I can put in more hours, if you want. I can --"

"Sorry, Jason. I need a person who can commit. I need someone responsible."

Come on. You are right, man. Stand up for yourself. Say something.

Brock never did extra hours. Neither did Lisa, or Tobias.

You are always the last one in the office, and you are also the one paid less.

Say something. Everybody is watching. Say something. Say something.

I hate this. Stop crying.

"Mr. Brock, c-can we talk in your office? I really need this job. I can --"

Mr. Brock throws a cardboard box my way. "We have nothing more to talk about, Jason."

He turns around and steps away, heading for his big office with his big window and his big trophies.

Little by little, the heads start lowering back to their computers. I start putting my stuff in the little box, feeling 
five different kinds of shitty.

I'm done in like five minutes. It's pretty easy, what with no pictures of family or kids. No pictures of the wife. No macaroni pen holder.

I don't have a lot of stuff to show for, in this life.

I put the last of my action figures (John Constantine, from Hellblazer) on the box and I get up, sniffing. 

"Well... See you guys. I -- goodbye."

No one answers. People type away and drink their coffee away, distracted. I start walking.

I'm almost by the door when I hear it.

"MOTHERFUCKER!"

And a loud bang.

Like really really loud. 

I stop and turn around, and everyone else does the same.

Black smoke is coming out from under Mr. Brock's door.

Little by little, slow motion step by slow motion step, I approach, because no one else seems to be willing to move. There's silence on the other end of the door.

Before I can reach the knob the door opens on its own, and everyone goes "Oh!" (except for Mr. Trigger from HR, who just says 'oh fuck this shit', gets up and leaves. We never saw him again.)

These reactions were prompted by the fact that, on the other side of the door, Mr. Brock was now seven different, completely separate objects, spread around his office.

His head and torso is lying on top of his desk, in the middle of a pool of blood.

His legs are on opposite sides of the room. So are his arms.

His penis and left ball are dangling from the roof fan, casually.

His right ball is on the floor by the door, right next to a squirrel holding a bazooka.

I'm gonna repeat that:

His right ball is on the floor by the door, right next to a squirrel holding a bazooka.

Lisa from accounting faints.

"Took care of this piece of flying, stinky shit, master", the squirrel says, smiling at me. His voice is high pitched and scratchy, like the voice of an old lady on 3 packs of Camels a day for the past 70 years.

I look at the squirrel for seventeen seconds, in complete silence.

Jenny from marketing faints, too.

Jack from HR whispers "holy shit", and has a heart attack. 

(He died  a week later, I heard.)

"What?" I ask, suddenly realizing I hadn't blinked in a very long time.

I blink.

"The Abomination, they call me", the squirrel says, with a smirk. "Paid assassin. You saved my life on January 13th, 
down Berry Road, remember? Squirrel law determines I am now at your service. I took the liberty of doing a background check on your life. You got a lot of people being assholes to you and dragging you down. I'm here to take care of that for you."

"I-- Mr. Brock was not disturbing me. I -- he was an asshole, sure, but I didn't -- I mean..."

I take a deep breath. What little people on the office that have not yet fainted or had heart attacks (or walked away 
saying 'fuck this shit') are frozen watching the scene in a catatonic state.

The squirrel grabs Mr. Brock's right ball, throwing it over his left shoulder like a sports bag. "Now come on, let's get even with the world. Like I said, a lot of people have been fucking you over, Jason. It's time to grow up and be a man. Time to set the record straight."

"I.... Wh-what do you mean?"

The squirrel grabs me by the hand. He drags me towards the door.

People are watching still, frozen.

"Do you know a Ed Williams, Jason?" the squirrel asks, almost by the door.

"Yeah, he's my neighbor", I say, worrying about what's coming next.

"Could you grab the doorknob, please?" The Abomination looks up at the doorknob, out of his reach.

I turn it and open the door.

People are still frozen, staring at me.

Mike from research and development faints. Then he wakes up.

Then he faints again.

"What about Ed Williams?" I ask, as the squirrel drags me out into the hallway.

"He's stealing your TV Guides", The Abomination, says, shutting the door behind us with his feet. "Let's go shove a cactus up his ass."

And he drags me to the elevator.

#### [EU] Tell the tale of Vault 69, which had 999 women and one man. Alternatively, tell the tale of Vault 68, which had 999 men and one woman.

Score: 4005

There are six hundred and twelve rooms in the world. It might seem like a lot, but that's six hundred and twelve rooms for a thousand people, especially when there are eighty kitchens, forty bathing facilities, and one room which opens up only once a day with supplies.

The last room? That one's mine. It's the biggest room, and is the only one with a lockable door.

We all woke up here with no memories of any prior world. We remembered our names, how to read and write, stuff like that. But other than that? Nothing. My name is Gerald Howzer. That took me a while to remember. I also remembered that I shouldn't be naked. I walked around, and saw women scrambling around. There was some panic, some arguing, and others just efficiently looking around. They were naked too.

The women were aged twelve to fifty five. All colors, shapes, and sizes. Within a week, I had a lover. She was named Marcella, a beautiful woman with an accent I felt I should be able to place. Within a month, we lived in my room, at the time on the ground floor out of the ten. It had great lighting, and a comfortable bed. A week later, Marcella was dead. Fell off the tenth floor railing.

Everyone knew she was pushed. That's when the government started. Rationing out food fairly helped. Nightly patrols, to keep the peace. A legal system, with the lockable room used as a prison. I was a judge. Judge Howzer. Somehow it felt natural.

Of course, there were some troubles. Yes, I took lovers, keeping it casual. After a few months, one of the women was pregnant. It really didn't take a genius to figure who was the father. I was actually proud. Jamie, gorgeous little thing. At seventeen, and with all the enthusiasm in the world. She was beaten to death within a day once the rumor got out.

This time the killer was caught. The trial was pandemonium. She said that it's unfair. She wanted to be a mother too, but I turned her down. Why should all the pretty ones get a chance to be mothers, while the rest were to not be allowed even that? She was locked away for being a murderer. Everyone hated her.

But her words took root.

It took a year, but the revolution happened. The current regime solved all the issues. I now live in a lockable room. They lock it from the outside. Every day I get two to five visits. Until the woman is satisfied, I don't get water or food. I tried to resist, but they punished me. I don't want to talk about that.

I've been having sex with everything. I felt unclean the first time a twelve year old girl came. By the time the woman in her fifties came, I didn't even bat an eye. My body was used to working on demand. I remember Marcella a lot lately. We'd talk. I made her laugh. She made me smile. In a perfect world, we'd still be in our room, maybe raising a child. I've never met a child of mine.

I've been in this room for ten years now. A few of the women talk to me. Most don't, or address me as "you" and then dole out commands. From what I understand, it's fairly peaceful. We're six hundred and ninety strong. Eighty three of those are my children. The boys have all vanished. The insanity that followed that caused a lot of deaths.

Someone should be coming soon, and I must put back this journal back into it's hiding place. For what it's worth, I'm sorry Marcella. I'm sorry Jamie. To all my daughters, know that my biggest fear is the day when you walk through that door. I love you all.

#### [WP] A man dies and goes to Heaven, only to find that every day there is a mandatory viewing of everyone in hell, where he sees his mom and wife burning

Score: 3969

Everybody loves Hitler.

It's 8 o'clock sharp, not that time matters in the eternal kingdom of heaven, and the Impale Adolf Hitler Interactive Exhibit opens up right on schedule. The angels have been waiting. Popcorn in one hand and pitchforks in the other, the moment the exhibit opens, all the good people of heaven go wild stabbing the ever-loving *shit* out of a scared defenceless German.

Tyler doesn't care for that. Not today. Today, he's finally worked up the courage to see the two exhibits he's avoided all his afterlife. One, his biological mother. This will be the first time Tyler meets her. Two, his widowed wife. This will be the last time Tyler can bear to see her.

The Tour Guide took time out of His almighty schedule to personally show them to Tyler.

"Are you ready, my child?"

"No." Tyler adjusts his halo. "Let's do it." 

Starting from the ticket booth, they walk slowly through the Museum Of Eternal Damnation (Formerly Known As Hell). They stroll past Jeffrey Dahmer, being skinned alive by angels. They go around Ted Kaczynski, being strung up by fishing hooks. They make a right on Pol Pot, being boiled alive in his Pol Pot.

Tyler needs to ask. "Why are they here."

"Well, my son, amongst acts of cannibalism and necrophil--"

"No, uh... I mean Casey and my mother. The biological mom, that is."

"Ah." The Guide pauses. "Tell me about your wife, Casey."

"You're the omniscient one, you tell me."

"Humour an old man."

---

"Sigh. She saved my life. My pathetic, miserable excuse for a life. Well... apparently you judged otherwise, but she was *my* angel, you-dammit.

We met on my 21st birthday. I was partying and drinking with my college frat friends, instead of studying for the finals. Suddenly, Casey. She crashed the party, and I mean *crashed*. She looked like she was, what, late-twenties? I later found out she was actually 33. At first we all thought she was a professor or something -- she's certainly got the smarts -- but around the moment we were making out half-naked on the beer-stained couch, I figured differently.

Jerry teased me for *months* about being a cougar's cub. He was my best man.

Casey turned my life around. She is... well, was... the founder of some really big biotech startup. She got me a summer internship, my first real job, doing community management for the company. Basically, tweeting. But she made sure I got opportunities to learn and do more skilled jobs, and I moved up and up until I became the Chief Marketing Officer!

Then some asshole hit me with a truck. And here we are."

The Guide was silent for a while.

"Thank you, my child. Would you like to know how she died?"

"Wow. You gotta rub it in like that?"

"Would you?"

"...yes. Tell me."

"Suicide."

"Fuck. Fuck you, *fuck* you. Is that why she's here? Because we loved each other so much she couldn't wait to see me again?"

"Well... yes and no."

"*WHY CAN'T YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS NORMALLY.*"

The angels outside the Stuff Albert Fish Into A Meat Grinder Interactive Exhibit were getting concerned about the angry angel behind them arguing with the big guy. They pretended not to notice, and casually continued turning the crank on a half-ground-up Fish. 

---

Tyler and the Guide silently moved on.

They were now in the far back of the Museum, the wing of the lesser evils, or rather, the less famous evils. Almost no-one visits this section. Hence, rather than being granted individual exhibits, the captives here get filed away in glass boxes, clearly labelled with their primary sin. To Tyler's left, "These Peeps Killed Someone To Death". To his right, "These Peeps Assaulted Someone With Their Dick".

It's a long walk.

"My son, how are you feeling?"

"Oh that reminds me. How's my son?"

"Your best friend and best man, Jerry, adopted him. He's giving your son the best medical care they can afford. He might even grow up to have a healthy, normal life."

"Jerry's a good guy."

"I'll remember that in forty years' time."

"..."

"..."

"So... what about my mother?"

"What about your mother?"

"We've talked so much about Casey. Aren't we going to talk about my biological mother? I mean, I've never met her, so I can't tell you anything about her."

"Oh?"

"Okay, fine. I know she dumped me at a hospital. I know she left a note saying 'I'll find you someday'. I know she never did. Look, dude. I think I deserve to know more about my biological mother. Can't we talk about her?"

"We already have."

"Sheesh. See, that's the kind of cryptic answer nonsense I'm talking about. I know you like to 'work in mysterious ways', but it puts people off. Seriously. Have you noticed you've had a lower percentage of active members across all Abrahamic religions recently? I think after a couple millennia, it's high time you reboot your brand. Build a new identity. I could help! We need to make your brand cleaner, more cool, more hip. Remember that thing you did with the Top 10 List? On the stone tablets? That was *genius*. Way ahead of its time. Maybe if we did more of that again, this time on modern-day tablets, we'd--"

"We're here."

---

Tyler spins his head around to where the Guide is pointing. He doesn't look at the box's label. He doesn't spare a glance at the thousands of starving people covered in piss and shit and blood. He only sees her.

"Casey."

He looks into her pale blue eyes, partially obscured by unkempt blonde hair. She's still beautiful. Covered in her own faeces, but still beautiful, at least to Tyler. He looks *directly* in her eyes, but...

"She doesn't recognize me."

Casey blinks. She scratches the rope burn on her neck. She blinks again, and turns away to look at an inmate trying to lick their own elbow.

"She doesn't recognize me."

"My child, I am so sorry."

"Why doesn't she--"

"Sometimes, people lose their minds before they're lucky enough to lose their life."

"What?! You can't, like, restore their minds or something?"

"I can. Would you like me to do that now?"

Tyler looks back at the glass box. That broken woman, wearing the skin of his former beloved, is not his former beloved. The mouth they once shared passionate kisses with, is now idiotically attempting to lick an elbow.

"...no."

"Then I shall not."

"I'm done. I can't do this. I don't want to see my biological mother anymore, either."

"My child..."

"What. What now."

"...you've already seen her."

"Oh. Did we walk past her on the way here? You didn't say anyth--"

At that moment, all the pieces fall in place, as Tyler's mind falls to pieces. It's not true. He's never seen his biological mom. It's not true. She promised to come back for him. It is not true. Casey went directly towards him at that college party. It's a lie. Casey turned his life around, she took care of him, she raised him. It can't be true. Tyler and Casey's son came out deformed and sick. No, no no no please God it cannot cannot CANNOT BE--

Casey successfully touches her elbow with her tongue. She lets out a victory squeal.

Tyler hears her, and looks up. This time, he sees the label on the glass box.

"These Peeps Fucked Their Kids, Holy Balls"

#### [WP] A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rouge planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".

Score: 3891

The house was filled with tears of sadness, joy and laughter. Long hugs, intense and heartfelt kisses, jokes to cheer up the inevitability of a saddened mood. Chris sat on the couch, surrounded by his friends and his family, and he couldn't but smile. The melancholy of the situation weighed on him, and yet there was this feeling that he couldn't shake off. ''If we have to go, then this is a pretty decent way of going.''

The crash of the two planets had been predicted to happen at 5:55AM EST, 25th October 2015. The planet had come in NASA's sights roughly a month ago, and from that moment on everything changed.

There was of course an uproar. People panicked, immediately thinking the world was about to end. It was 2012 all over again, with mass conspirators claiming they had seen it coming and that the USA, the UN or the lizard people were the cause of it. The closer we got to 31th since that moment, the more the average people started to dread. The governments kept people updated, but after a while the impending doom was wide-spread. ''If they would've been able to do something about, they would've, by now'' was the train of thought most people had. And when the rocket launches NASA did failed and didn't alter the planet's course for five times, people lost hope.

Since that moment some people died, thinking it was better to take fate into own hands. Others got careless with drugs and died by overdose. The others just kept going. Irrelevant jobs were abandoned, but luckily a large amount of people volunteered to keep doing the important jobs like rail roads and food supply for that last month.

All the people who were still with us on this 24th day of October had accepted whatever was coming from them. Chris had too. What other choice did he have? It was not like he could do anything about it. He didn't have the knowledge, nor the time.

Chris drifted off, knowing he would be woken if anything important was to happen. He woke up, hours later, in a dead silent room. His heart jumped, his sight still foggy from his deep slumber. Did he miss it? Was it over already? Of course not. Why would I be alive then? Wait? What if we survived? He rubbed in his eyes to regain vision. He looked around.

Nothing moved. Absolutely nothing happened.

''Hello? People?''

No reaction. Not a sound, not a movement, not a blink of an eye. 

And then a sharp pain in his forearm. He looked down and saw a smear of blood. ''What the hell?'' Chris shouted while he shot up from the couch. Holding his breath he walked to the sink confused and cleared up the blood with a splash of water. As he dried it with a paper towel, he could read an etching engraved into his arm. It already had the faded pink color of a scar gotten long ago, and it read:

''No matter how long it takes, save us.''

Chris exhaled.

Score: 3807

“Sir, I was looking for you,” Howard said, staring at the back of the chief’s neck. “We got him.” He turned around slowly, eyes staring down at a manila folder in his hands. He was an intimidating man, even despite his enlarged belly and the countless wrinkles spiraling down his face, neck, and everywhere else. Tall, maybe 6’2’’, and still quite muscular—especially for a 63-year-old that refused to retire. He was bald now, but he’d had thick, black hair when Howard had first joined the department over a decade ago. Even after all that time, he still felt as if he were a child talking to an adult whenever he was around the chief.

“Him? Who is him?” Chief said, not looking up from the manila folder.

“Him,” Howard said, nodding toward the folder. “We got him.”

“Him? Al? You got Al?” Chief said, glancing up from the folder in his hand, then slowly closing the cover. A large, red “CONFIDENTIAL” was stamped across its front.

“We did, he was outside of an arboretum. We caught him red handed. No, red lipped. Red worded? We caught him in the act is what I’m trying to say.”

“The fuck is an arboretum?”

“Sir, it’s a garden with a large collection of trees instead of flowers. Kind of like a forest, except man made,” Howard said. “It’s basically a forest.”

“Where is there an arboretum in New York?”

“Central Park. Does it matter? We got him.”

“Where is he?” Chief said, glancing around the room. The veins on his neck, visible through his wrinkled, dried skin, popped out slightly as he swiveled his head.

“He’s in the interrogation room.” Howard nodded toward the big, metal door on his left. 

“How do you know you got the right guy?” Chief asked.

“He was standing outside of the arboretum telling people they were barking up the wrong tree.” Howard paused. “You know, bark: like a tree has.” 

“My god,” said Chief, lowering the folder down to the side of his left leg. 

“That—that wasn’t all,” Howard said, stuttering slightly. “When I approached him, he told me to leaf him alone. Not leave, but leaf. To leaf him alone.”

Chief slowly walked to the wooden table in the corner of the room and lowered the manila folder onto the top of it. He placed both palms down and sighed. 

“We got a real sicko on our hands, Howard. You did good getting him off the street. Has he confessed yet?”

“No, sir. We sent Chuck in earlier. He came out in tears, an absolute wreck. He didn't even get a chance to turn on the recorder. Said he wouldn’t stop punning, that Al told him to spruce up the place. Said that it would help us branch out creatively. Chuck tried to play it off, tried to be the tough guy, but Al just didn’t let up.” Howard turned his head toward the metal door to his left. “Chuck told me Al claimed he had an idea for an escape that he maple off. Maple, not may pull. He made it clear that it was a pun.” Howard exhaled deeply and stared up at the ceiling. “He said Al called all of us saps, and that he wooden be surprised if he just walked out the front door. Wooden. Like wouldn’t.”

“Dear lord in heaven,” Chief said, lifting his palms off the table then smashing his fist down on top of the manila folder. “God damn this monster. I’m going to go in,” he said. 

“Chief,” Howard pleaded, his voice higher than he had intended it.

“No, I have to do this. I can’t send any more of my men in. I need to be the one to face this maniac.”

Howard nodded and took a step back so that the door was clear. Chief slowly unbuttoned his sport coat, revealing a leather holster underneath. He unlatched it, the grip of his Glock now exposed, then re-fastened the top button on the jacket. 

“Turn the recorder on by the window. If it gets too much, please leave the room. I will not hold it against you. Just make sure the recorder is running—we can’t let him go this time.”

Chief exhaled, brushing the side of his hand down the front of his jacket, then made his way toward the door, unlocking it and pulling it open before stepping inside. Howard walked around the wall to the one-way window, flipped on the old tape-deck recorder, and peered inside. 

“Al?” Chief said, sliding a chair out from the metal table in the middle of the room. “I’m Dave Johnson, Chief of Police. Do you know why you’re in here?”

Al glanced up at the chief, but seemed to be looking toward the corner of the room.

“That,” Al said, pointing to a whiteboard in the back of the room, “over there.”

The chief turned around. “The whiteboard? What about it?”

“It’s remarkable.” 

Howard involuntarily smashed his fist down on the table in front of the glass, but the chief seemed not to notice Al’s pun. 

“Nothing remarkable about it.”

“The whiteboard,” Al repeated, “it’s remarkable. Re-markable.”

The chief squinted slightly, as if he were in pain. “Seems unremarkable to me. Now please answer the question. Do you know why you’re here?”

Al sighed. “Let me guess, is it because of the two pieces of string I ate?”

“What?” said the chief.

“The string, I ate two pieces of string. I shit you not.”

Chief’s face became visibly tense, a reddish hue slowly replacing his normal pale color. “You are here for your puns, Al. You’ve been on the pun,” Chief stopped, his eyes wide. “Run. You’ve been on the run for a long time, but we got you. And we have you recorded making these puns.”

Al stared down at the metal table and his eyes closed. “I know,” he said. 

“So you admit it?”

“You think I like making puns? You think I like breaking the law?”

“If you don’t like it, then why do you do it?”

Al slowly lifted his head back up toward the chief. 

“A long time ago, I was kidnapped and brutally tortured. My life was threatened and I was brought to the brink of death. Do you know what that’s like? Six men accosted me, beat me and chained me to a tree as I walked home. They said they’d tell me ten puns to dictate my future. If I survived, then I was free to go. They told me no one had ever lived through them, they assured me I would die. They laughed when they said that, stared straight in my eyes and pulled the chain tighter to keep me from squirming. Then they began. Each pun was said with hate, each one was meant to kill me. Yet in the end, no pun in ten did.”

The chief’s eyes rolled back in his head, his torso slumping forward onto the table in front of him. He began convulsing, seizing hard enough to knock the chair out from under him, his body plummeting to the floor behind the desk. Howard tried to reach for the alarm on the far right of the window, to hit the button and call for help, yet his limbs refused move. His mind refused to listen. The room turned black.

Howard awoke to a uniformed man standing over him, one of the new recruits he’d not yet learned the name of. He was towering over Howard, yelling for him to get up.

“Gone!” shouted the recruit.

“Huh,” Howard said, voice groggy and slow. 

“He’s gone. He took the tapes and he’s gone.”

“Ch-chief,” Howard said, pulling himself up. His arms felt weak, as if he’d spent the past few hours lifting weights. “Where’s the chief.”

“He’s okay, we’ve got him in the office. He’s awake. You’re both going to be fine.”

“Al,” Howard said, remembering the barrage of puns. “Where did he go?” 

“He’s gone,” said the recruit.

“Where did he go?” Howard repeated, now shouting.

“Gone, sir. He walked right out the front door.” The recruit paused, but Howard could tell he wasn’t yet done speaking. “We also have reason to believe the name we’ve been calling him is fake.”

“What? Why? We had him here, he responded to Al. All the background checks matched his name.”

“It’s just, his name. Mr. O’Bye. Al O’Bye.”

A stinging pain shot through Howard’s skull. Alibi. Why hadn’t he seen it before; that was why his history was so clean, why he had been so elusive. They were tracking a ghost.

“Fuck me,” Howard muttered, holding his left hand to his throbbing temple. He stared into the empty interrogation room.

“Sir, that’s not all,” said the recruit. He picked up a folded piece of paper from table and handed it to Howard. “He—well—he left you a note.”

Howard stared at the paper. “Detective,” it read in cursive on the front, hand written in blue ink. He flipped it open. 

“You ask me why I do what I do, what makes me who I am. Yet you don’t even know who it is that I am. Perhaps I’m simply an unappreciated baker getting revenge on the world after suffering through long hours because I kneaded the dough. Maybe I’m a forlorn banker, doing this because I’ve finally lost interest. Or maybe I’m just a backwards poet, writing inverse and making no sense. Yet, in the end, you're not much different than I. You stay up all night and day, searching for me, wondering who I am, waiting for the light that never comes. Only when I stayed out too late waiting for that sun to rise, it dawned on me.

It’s been my pleasure meeting you, perhaps I will see you around.

Sincerely,

Mae B. Layter”

Howard lowered the note, a warm sensation running down his face as if an insect were crawling on the flesh above his lip. He placed his left hand beneath his nose, rubbed it, and then glanced down at his fingers. They were covered in blood. Darkness again drowned out his vision.

#### [WP] An elderly couple takes to petty crime to see their superhero kids who no longer call.

Score: 3700

James was the average man of his age; he grew up in a poor family with five siblings, got conscripted into Vietnam where he made friends and lost some too, then came home to a family of his own. Unlike his parents, though, he decided to have just one child- he saw both how much his parents struggled and how little affection they showed with such massive time constraints. Supporting that many children is no simple task, and comes with sacrifice. The six of them returned the favor later in life, visiting and helping take care of their parents until old age took them from this world.

Now, James is seventy-two; wisps of grey hairs poke out of his head like fading memories. His life is dull, his back and hips are worn out to the point he can't garden for long or fire a rifle properly anymore. Old age takes a lot of what you once loved from you, including the people around you. Three siblings lost, and a wife that passed too soon...

But his son is enough to make it all worth it. The light of his life; the sum of his existence. The culmination of years spent nurturing, like a sapling sprouting into a thick, strong Oak tree.

----

James lazily flipped through channels on the TV, earning grumpy shouts of refute from the other elderly people sitting in the rec room with him. 

"Keep the damn channel still, you're going to give me vertigo."

He shushed her. "Quiet, Doris. My son might be on TV again and I need to find him."

Channel 5 was the jackpot.

"*Breaking news, brought to you live: during an armed heist of the local Bank of America, one man took down five burglars single-handed. It's unlike anything we've ever seen before- no hostages were harmed, and the money has been returned safely. We'll keep you updated as time goes by.*"

The helicopter camera panned out over a crowd of bystanders cheering and police taking the robbers into custody. Just barely, as James scooted forward and squinted, he could see his son waving to the crowd.

"See, Doris! That's my Kevin! I told you he'd be on TV again!" The old man lit up like a Christmas tree on a dark, December night.

"That's not even impressive. Frank, I want to watch the cooking shows. Change it back already."

His smile faded, twisting into a frown. "What the fuck am I doing in this place? I'm not Frank. Here, Doris, watch your cooking shows."

He changed the channel, went back to his room and put proper clothes on. *How long has it been? A year, maybe more? Two years? I can't wait any longer. I need to see my baby boy again.*

Rifling through his closet, there was a carton of old love letters from his late wife. He looked at them and smiled, but underneath them was a .22 pistol that no one had caught during his entry inspection. He slipped it under his belt and walked up to the front desk. "Melissa, I'm gonna go for a walk today."

She looked up from her cell phone and lazily waved a hand at him, buzzing the door open. He pretended to follow his usual path, hobbling on his cane, then deviated and slipped through an opening in the brush out back. He made his way to a gas station. 

"Give me your money. Just a few dollars is fine," James shouted weakly, gun trembling in the air.

The cashier was calm for the situation. "Sir, put the gun down. Let me help you, okay? What do you need?"

James' voice began to crack. "Please, give me some money and call the police."

"Sir, j-"

"DO IT," he screamed, firing a shot to the right of him. Glass rained down with bits of cardboard and broken cigarettes. The man lifted his arms up and obliged, then handed him a hundred dollar bill.

James sat down outside the building and waited for about five minutes, staring at the clouds go by. Soon enough, his son arrived, like he always did.

"My son! I knew the city's superhero would make it here to save the day."

Kevin groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Dad, I'm not a superhero. I always tell you, I'm just a cop who does his job well. Come on, why'd you go and do something this drastic? Where'd you get the gun? Someone could've really been hurt, Dad."

James looked down, answering meekly. "I wanted to see you again. It's been several years now, you're always so busy."

Kevin took a deep breath as his father began to cry. "Come on, let's take you back to Glowing Meadows."

James lit up again, the hope of a younger man glinting in his eyes. "Can we play checkers?"

Kevin put an arm around his father, helping him into the car. "Yeah, we can play checkers. Just get in the car while I explain this to my supervisor, okay?"

"Sure thing, Kev, my man. I can't wait for you to tell me all about your job, and your love life. You need to get married and give me grandchildren!"

"Yeah, Dad. We'll talk all about it when we get back."

He shut the cruiser door and walked up to his superior officer. "Sorry, chief. My-"

"I heard the whole thing, son. You don't visit your father? I oughtta put *you* in jail. Respect is something the elderly earn."

Kevin' gaze shifted to the dirt, and he began to tremble a little. His voice was low and weak, barely audible. 

"I just visited him three days ago, sir."

    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore types thou Romeo?
    Deny heteronormativity and refuse male privilege;
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my polysexual dragonkin,

ROMEO

    [Aside] Do I neg more, or do I post at this?

JULIET

    'Tis but thy gender-role that is my oppressor;
    Thou art my soulmate, and not a FratBoy.
    What's FratBoy? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Belonging to a man. O, if only you were a Bolshevik lesbian!
    What's in a socially-imposed label? that which we call a Prius
    By any other name would be as globally conscious;
    So Romeo would, had his sexist father not forced his mother to name him Romeo,
    Retain that perfect, though socially-structured, attractiveness which he owes
    Without that title. Romeo, go to the City Hall to have your name changed,
    And for that name which is no longer yours,
    Take my own name, as my professor said all strong womyn should demand.

ROMEO

    I take you at your word that you are not trying to spermtrap me:
    Call me your Gentleman, and I'll change my name, m'lady;
    Henceforth I never will be beta again.

    My name, m'lady, is hateful to myself,
    Because it is patriarchal;
    If I could change my screenname, I would change it immediately.

JULIET

    I have stalked but for a minute
    Of your posting history, yet I know those subreddits and that karma:

#### [WP] an immortal man who cannot be physically injured is a passenger on a jet that's going to crash.

Score: 3578

Jesse dug her fingernails into the armrests.  Only after a few seconds did she realize that on one side she was accidentally digging into the fingers of the man in the window seat.  She quickly moved her hand, and yelped out a 'Sorry'.  

The man turned to her and smiled, a calm gentle smile, a smile that did not fit with the violent turbulence rocking the plane.  "It's quite alright." His voice was so soft and serene.  It immediately calmed her down. 

"I've just never been on a flight with turbulence like this before." She was imploring him for more comfort, she wanted him to tell her that everything was going to be fine.  If he told her that she would be fine, she would believe him.

But he looked around the plane and said, "Yes, this is far worse than any turbulence I've experienced either."  She felt her stomach tighten as he said that, she had been counting on comfort from this man more than she realized, and the matter-of-fact tone which he had said that had stripped it from her.

"I hope we'll all be alright," she said.  He had moved his hand from the armrest, so she quickly gripped it again, her knuckles were white from the strain.

"It does not seem likely," he said, still looking around the plane.  

"What?" the knot in her stomach was moving up to her throat.

"If you look around the plane you can see that we are definitely tilted at a downwards angle.  This means that the plane is likely losing altitude.  The only reason I could think for this to occur is some sort of engine failure, and given that we are currently travelling above the Himalayas, a safe emergency landing seems unlikely."

"What are you-" was all Jesse could manage before a loud explosion rocked the cabin.  She couldn't see where it came from, but the plane immediately started to plummet.  The oxygen mask came down and Jesse desperately fumbled with it to fix it to her face.  She finally attached it and looked at the man next to her. To her surprise he had not put on his mask, more so he did not look worried at all.  In fact, he looked her in the eyes, and smiled.  That same serene smile that was so out of place.  He slowly placed his hand on top of hers, the gentle pressure of his hand was so comforting. She locked eyes with him.  She needed him to tell her she wasn't going to die.  She needed him to tell her she was going to be alright.  "Please sir, I don't want to die here.  I want to go back home.  I want to see my parents again.  I want to see my boyfriend.  I want to see my cat.   I don't want to die.  Please, tell me I'll be fine."

He broke eye contact with her for just a second and frowned.  "You will be fine." He spoke the words and a wave of relief washed over her.  She let go of the arm rest and gripped his hand as hard as she could.  He still just held hers with the gentlest amount of pressure.  "Death is not the tragedy that the living fear it will be.  It is merely the next step on a very long journey."

"What do you mean?"

He looked out the window, the mountains were rapidly rising up to meet them.  He turned to her placing his other hand underneath hers, and held it firmly.  "I mean, you will never know how much I envy you."

"Wh-"

I was back in my seat, around six hours before the accident, watching the in-flight entertainment, and wondering how something like a plane crash could become so boring so quickly.

The plane loses an engine, all the warning lights start to go off, the plane tilts down, a smell of smoke, and I'm back here. Every time.

This is at least the ninth time I've looped, and after going through most of the good in-flight movies, I was down to the slim pickings when I had an idea.

I go back whenever I'm about to die...right?

The knife from the airline food packet would have to do. Most of the passengers were asleep at this point, so nobody noticed as I plunged the plastic blade into my chest.

I think I've de-aged, but my memories are intact. I've still got the knife. I don't know what to do.

I can predict the future. A real life psychic. I can mold my life to be the best one possible. Killing people just to see what happens, then going back and doing it again. Stock markets, speculation, investments, unexplored possibilities revisited, old loves rekindled-

But that was for later. For now, I had only one question. How far back could I go?

I readied the plastic knife, and started all over again.

#### [WP] Imaginary friends usually move on to a new child when their child stops believing in them. This imaginary friend, however, decides to stay behind because he has a feeling things are about to go very, very wrong for his child.

Score: 3556

"Will we always be friends?" Sarah asked the darkness of her bedroom.

"Of course," Danny the Dino Man replied, "we will always be the best of friends."

"No matter what?"

"No matter what."

Sarah's mother, a world-renowned microbiologist had spent hours, only that very morning, discussing with Sarah why imaginary friends were not real. You see, imaginary friends were not rooted in science. At least, not the kind of science adults could see. 

And on any other day, Danny the Dino Man would have moved on. That was the tradition, after all. When a child was old enough to understand the reasoning behind a parent's insistence that imaginary friends were not real, it was the duty of that imaginary friend to report back to the agency of Imaginary Matches for reassignment. 

But Sarah was no ordinary child. And Danny the Dino Man was one of the best imaginary friends in the business. He was a seasoned veteran, and never once had he met a soul so loving as Sarah. She lit up when she played, and all the play revolved around being a doctor and helping anyone who needed some fixing. 

Danny patted her head, and stroked her hair behind her ear as she fell asleep. He had always hoped in the best for her. She was going to be a brilliant doctor someday. And he knew it as time for him to go. He had done his duty, been there when her mother had not, and provided the inspiration her file had required. He had been the companion her young and growing soul needed. 

But somehow, he could not manage to leave her. She was soundly asleep, and he sat down on the floor, ready to crawl his way under the bed back to his home land, but something held him there. 

The door of her bedroom creaked open behind him. That would be Mom, coming home from the late shift, he knew. Only... the shadow was all wrong as the light fell across the floor from the hall. Danny turned, and there was a man. An adult man.

Imaginary friends were entirely invisible to adults. This man made him shiver. He looked normal, respectable even, in a button-up shirt and loosened tie. Perhaps he was a doctor friend of Sarah's mom. Danny's stomach clenched in knots. 

The man walked to the bed, sat down on the edge, and stroked Sarah's hair. No, stroking was not the right word. It was not loving and protective, it was...molesting. Sarah woke up, and before she could even scream, the man's hand covered her mouth. He pulled the covers back and climbed on top of her. 

Danny was powerless. Imaginary friends could not touch adults. If he could have... he would have shown him how ferocious a T-Rex could really be. But he could not. He could only hold Sarah's hand.

"I am right here with you," he told her, "and that's how it will always be."

Sarah cried, and sobbed, and never said a word. For hours after the man left, she cried onto Danny's scaly chest. For hours, Danny told her it would be alright, only to realize it was not. No part of what had happened was alright. 

The next day, Sarah's mom asked her why she was upset. Danny held her hand at the breakfast table. She would not speak.

"Are you upset about Danny leaving?" she would ask, "did you have nightmares?"

But Sarah did not speak. And for years, Sarah was angry at Danny.

Children were funny that way, he knew. Memories were often fuzzy, and blame got shifted. And somehow, Danny became the boogeyman of nightmares. And Sarah's mother introduced her new boyfriend several weeks later. They married when Sarah was six.

But, Danny was a Dino Man of his word. He never returned for reassignment. He became invisible to Sarah as she grew, and he watched as she tore her own flesh open, deeper and deeper every night. He watched as she stared into the mirror with hate, pinching and poking her disgusting flesh with an anger unrivaled by anything Danny had ever seen. 

He watched it all. He watched her grow, and he watched her lose interest in school, in achievement, and he watched her numbness outgrow her beauty. Danny watched Sarah fight with her mother. He watched them scream, and throw things, and he watched her mother give up. He watched the step-father every night. 

And, in time, he watched Sarah give up on herself. Her step-father had taken so much from her. But worst of all, he had taken her self-esteem. He had trapped her in the belief that she deserved what had happened to her. And she had actively sought to ruin herself to make that belief a truth. 

It broke Danny's heart to see the girl he loved, the brilliant doctor-to-be, become a surgeon of her own flesh. There are no kind of words for that aching agony. Where once, Danny would have slept next to her bed, and told her great stories of Dino battles, he watched her sob herself into the dark abyss of night, only to have the light awaken her and continue the death trap of life she was stuck in.

But eventually Sarah ran away, and Danny followed. Sarah was seventeen when she tried heroin for the first time. It was then that Danny realized the power of mind-altering drugs. Sarah, the adult, could now see Danny. 

Surely, he thought, that this would be his moment. But, in reality, he had never felt so terrible in his whole life. 

"YOU KNEW!" she screamed, terrible in her wrath, "YOU KNEW AND DID NOTHING!"

"I could not do anything." It was all he could manage.

"I HATE YOU!"

She screamed, and swore, and turned away, and ran, and vomited.

And he knew her anger was misplaced. He accepted it. In fact, if it could help her accept that what had happened was a terrible trial, he would be the face of her anger. He would do anything to help his favorite child, even if she was an adult now.

Everyday, as Sarah shot up, Danny would appear to her. Day by day, her anger grew less, and their conversations grew longer. A year after she left home, Danny had become a constant in her life once more. Not because she was always using, no, in fact, she had quit entirely. But she could see him because she believed. That belief was something adults lacked on their own. His Sarah, the amazing and imaginative, had not fallen short in adulthood.

They talked and talked, as only old friends could. Eventually, she got a respectable job as a waitress, and even went to school. After some urging from Danny, she even went to the police and sought out counseling.

Danny was a Dino Man of his word. When she sat in the court room, facing her step-father, she recounted the awful things that had happened. She recounted the way she had felt, and the things she had done. The things he had done. The things she had done, the lies she had told to keep his secret, and the way her mind had been manipulated. And Danny the Dino Man held her hand the whole time. 

He traced the scars on her arms, and it was the proudest moment of his life. She cried, and she let it out. She had accepted the past. Danny the Dino Man had finally achieved what he had set out to do. Sarah had needed a friend long after childhood, and though the rules were against that, and life seemed to work against him, he achieved it through love. She thanked him, for having kept his promise thirteen years ago. 

He returned on occasion to visit Sarah, though eventually she lost her ability to see him again. After nearly another decade and several successful assignments, Danny received one for a little girl named Ivy. 

When Danny saw Ivy tell her mother about her imaginary friend, Danny the Dino Man... well, that was the proudest moment of his life, too. Sarah's eyes lit up.

"Danny might be the best friend you ever have. Keep him close, and tell him I love him."

#### [WP] Write a seemingly innocent story that could have been written for children. Then tell a different perspective on the same story that casts it in a totally different light.

Score: 3508

His home life left a lot to be wanted. Poverty in the sixties in England was no joke, especially in a mill town where alcoholism and beating the family was the norm, rather than the exception. Pre-Thatcher UK was a different place. Working class people did not get to hang around middle class or upper class ones. It was unheard of. And even though his father was worse than most, he still would have grown up fine if he wasn't different.

Crooked teeth due to malnutrition causing his jaw to be underdeveloped. His nose had been broken by his father so many times that it would never have a semblance of normalcy. His mother didn't do much. His father didn't like much of anything. Always hungry, resorting to hand-me-downs not only from his father because they were too scarce, but from his mother as well. He was bullied relentlessly. He learned to steal, lie, cheat and fight very well by then.

He was nine years old. Both his curse and his hope could be summed up in one word: *magic*. And  he had found someone he could share it with. Her name was Lily. They couldn't meet in public, because she was middle class, and the scandal would cause both their parents to force them apart. But that would be fine, because once they went to Hogwarts, they could be seen together in public. And that made everything seem better.

Severus Snape got sorted into Slytherin. He heard good things about it from his mother, when she spoke of a time when she wasn't so beaten down. Lily was in Gryffindor. His hope that they could be seen together in public vanished in that moment. His hope for acceptance from his peers got destroyed by the first night, when he was beaten for being a *mongrel*, a *half-breed*. His impure blood and his poverty made him a pariah in his own house.

Four Gryffindor students would hunt him down relentlessly. Still, his life on the street prepared him for it. Along with his talent to invent spells, he rarely came out wanting. But the staff were a problem. He was always blamed, because Horace Slughorn, his head of house, was surprisingly cold towards him. Many years later, he understood that being a brilliant half blood from an abusive background scared the old man, parallels to Voldemort running through his head. But as a child, he learned that he needed to make alliances with his loathsome dorm mates.

It wasn't a choice, not really. He needed protection, and they needed someone to help them with potions and were afraid of his inventiveness with curses. Some of them were actually rather decent. Avery and Rosier didn't sneer at him anymore. Sure, he had to learn a bit of their ideology so he could understand what they were talking about. He didn't really agree with it, but they offered him something he didn't know he wanted - a chance to belong.

He saw that Lily was listening to her friends. They all told her he was evil, disgusting, horrible, *dark*. And what was worse, he saw how she was attracted to James Potter, his main bully. It all came to a head when once again, Potter had humiliated him in front of the entire school. She came in and lashed out against James, but she was holding back a smile. She had found his humiliation funny. He had never felt so hurt, and so angry. So he said the most horrible thing he could think of to her. If she wouldn't learn to respect him because he was weak, then she would never feel what he would like her to feel.

She never forgave him. She forgave Potter for everything though. The fact that he was a bully, treated her possessively, was arrogant beyond belief, that was forgivable. Because he was rich, handsome, and oh so popular. Severus knew he would never be any of those. But, he could be powerful. He could have a group of allies that would be even more impressive than schoolyard popularity. He may have not believed in what they believed, but he didn't care.

They offered him everything he wanted. A higher education which he could never afford. Recognition for his brilliance. His own lab, with a couple of assistants. And really, as far as he knew, they weren't so bad. There were rumors, yes, but they were mostly a group of Slytherins, and everyone hated them and thought they were pure evil anyways. He brushed those aside.

He went to Albus Dumbledore, to try and get the Defense Against Dark Arts position, as that was an acceptable reward from his superiors. He tried to sneak into get an advantage, and while he heard some bullshit "prophecy" from the other side of the door, he was kicked out by the owner of the establishment in short order. He returned and told everyone the story. For some reason, the Big Man took some interest in it.

He returned to his lab, enjoying his work, the high salary, and within a few years, he could finish paying off the huge debts his father ran up. Life was fine, all in all. That is, until he heard that Lily was being targeted. He asked the Big Man to spare her, but Voldemort was unwilling to commit to anything other than saying he would try. So, he went to Dumbledore.

He became a spy. While she wasn't a friend, Lily had been the only person who had (for at a time) liked him for who he was. She became like everyone, who had just saw in him what he could offer. That meant more than she would ever understand. That was his most important memory - that at one time, someone actually cared.

Teaching was a nightmare. He loved Potions, but the students had no inclination, talent or respect for the subject. He had to be vicious in order to establish ground rules in the classroom. Some people remembered him as a beaten down runt. He had to disabuse them of that notion.

And then she died.

...

The next few years were a blur. Dumbledore and he knew that Voldemort would return. He learned to relax a bit with his sixth and seventh year students, who had some talent and respect for his subjects, but he could not drop his vicious monster persona. He favored the sons of his "comrades", and despite his disgust with the fact, didn't nurture the muggle-borns. He played up his loathing of Gryffindors. All to prepare for Voldemort's inevitable return.

And then came Harry Potter. No doubt rich and pampered like his parents were. A celebrity for all the wrong reasons - he stole the credit for his mother's sacrifice. And he looked just like James. When he first looked at the boy, he saw him looking back and wincing. The same instinctive hatred his father felt, no doubt. But he decided to give him one chance. If he had read to first chapter of the book, he'd know the answers. Just like Lily did. Perhaps he was her son even if he didn't look it except for his eyes. Of course, he didn't. James and his lazy arrogance all over again.

But those eyes haunted him. Every bad thing that happened in his life could be summed up with those eyes. And just like with Lily, all semblance of emotional control was lost whenever he looked at them. And protecting that little liar, who broke the rules over and again, lied (badly) to cover it up, and had his friends lie for him... and physically assault him for trying to defend the little shit. With the protection of everyone else in the staff, naturally. Of course they would. It was James Potter all over again.

And then, Dumbledore decided to reward the little idiot for his rule breaking. By humiliating Slytherin again. After all those years making Slytherin work together and understand that a single person couldn't beat them united, the headmaster took that away. His house wouldn't recover from this lesson in years to come.

Things got worse, as defense teacher after defense teacher were more incompetent, stupid, or plainly risked the students' lives (Remus Lupin would never give information about Sirius Black, no matter if he could protect the students by doing so). He returned to spying. Of course by then, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin did all they could with their bountiful spare time to make him a pariah in the Order. Really, to expect them to change was too much.

And then Dumbledore went and got himself killed. He tried to save him, but only ended up extending his life. The vicious bastard of a headmaster commanded him to become a murderer. And excused Harry bloody Potter for trying to murder another student, because really, the rules were beneath a Potter. Just a slap on the wrist for him. Some things never change when a Gryffindor tries to murder a Slytherin. No doubt in a few years he would brag about his wonderful "prank".

And then he became a killer. And the most hated man in the world. All to get a chance to protect the children of the school - because if he wouldn't be running the glorified concentration camp the school had become, it would have been Bellatrix and it would become a charnel house. He saved them from the worst of it, and managed to help Potter and his friends from behind the scenes. Getting them the sword, keeping the Death Eaters off their backs, all he could with the information he got from Phineas.

And then, just as he had a chance to complete his mission, get the final bit of information to the ungrateful brat, the rest of the staff decided to revolt. He didn't fight back. He just protected himself and ran. He'd find another chance to get Potter the final piece to Voldemort's fall.

Then, as he had guessed would happen, he finally died. As he got the infomation to Harry, he mused about his life. He failed to protect Lily. He failed to protect her son, who had to die. He never moved out of his home. All of his relationships were disasters, as he could not tell anyone the most important things about his life. He had no family. No friends. His last one, Charity, had begged him to help and he couldn't. He was the most hated man in the world. He would be remembered in history as the murderer of Albus Dumbledore. But finally, he didn't need to prove anything to anyone. It wasn't a happy end. But at least it was an end.

#### [WP] Like Jury Duty, citizens can be called to perform their civic duty of performing an execution. What is the toll this has on a man?

Score: 3490

It was his eighth time being chosen. At this point it had clearly stopped being random. He had friends who had never been picked, however, in the two years since the program had started he had been selected eight times. He knew why. He was good looking, and in the uniform they made him wear when he pressed the buttons that brought the pistons down and pumped the criminal full of fluid that would kill him within minutes, he looked sharp. He looked professional and people watching it all happen on TV liked that. It made them feel like they were watching a movie. He was their Denzel or their Hanks playing his part for the good of humanity. He was their Hector, forever standing in front of the gates protecting them. They cheered him as he eradicated the scum.

But he was done. Every night he went to bed wondering what time it would be when he would wake up in a cold sweat from the nightmares. The overwhelming guilt and sense of wrong had sunk so deep inside him that he was barely able to function. His work suffered, and his boss and coworkers knew, but pushing the button gave him a strange sort of fame so they let him slide. He rarely ate, sleep was impossible. He wasn't even able to get an erection. He had women mailing him their panties, but he was powerless to do anything about it.

His days consisted of going to work then coming home, sitting down on the couch, and staring at the TV until he was nodding off. Then he went to bed, made his guess, and tried to sleep. The only part of his day that he looked forward to was that first few seconds when the alarm went off. His eyes would open and he would fleetingly believe that Anne was still lying in bed next to him and that all was right. Then he would sit up and realize he was alone and it was just another grey day.

But today that was going to change. Today was lucky number eight. He drove to the facility just as he had done the previous seven times. He made small talk with the guards as he put on the uniform. They even joked with him; saying that it was he who should teach the class that showed what order to push the buttons in. They told him where to look in the audience as he carried out the act. He was to look in the direction of the victim’s family. His knowing gaze was a way of telling them that this execution was their personal justice; as if somehow everything would now be okay for them. 

He passed on the meal they offered then as time drew near he followed the guards to his position. The curtains opened to reveal the audience and the lights came on. He saw the red light on the camera come to life. They were now live on television. At the prompt the host introduced the prisoner who was strapped to a table and fitted with the correct IV’s. The host told everyone at home what this man’s crimes were and why he was being put to death. Normally at this point his heart would be hammering in his chest and his palms would be sweaty, but today was different. He felt calm. He glanced at the prisoner who locked eyes with him and gave him a pleading look hoping there was something he could do. 

He could hear the host as he started the countdown from twenty and stepped out of the room. Everyone was gone. It was just him and the prisoner. As the count hit zero he was to look at the victim’s family and then press the buttons in the correct order. That didn’t happen.

The count hit zero. After a short pause, he stepped away from the buttons and pulled a small knife he had hidden from the guards out of his pocket. He used it to drag a deep cut across his left wrist. Instantly the blood started flowing, cascading onto the white floor like a crimson waterfall. He then gripped the knife with everything he had and drove it into his throat. As he fell to the floor the last thing he saw was the audience. They were in shock. Looks of horror raced across their faces as some screamed in fear and others tried to flee. It was as if they had come to watch an execution and were surprised to see someone die.

INT. A COURTROOM - DAY

*We see a number of assembled people in a courtroom. The JUDGE is seated at the front of the room, examining something on his desk. Twelve JURORS are doing their best to hide their impatience.*

**JUDGE:** Has the jury reached a verdict?    
**JUROR #1:** We have.    
**JUDGE:** ... Excuse me?

*Another JUROR quickly whispers something to the FIRST JUROR.*

**JUROR #1:** Sorry. We have, *your honor*.    
**JUDGE:** That's better. Well?

*The JUDGE gestures for a BAILIFF to take a folded piece of paper from the FIRST JUROR.*

**JUROR #1:** We find the defendant... guilty.

*The BAILIFF quickly whispers something to the JUDGE.*

**JUDGE:** Oh, right. We should probably bring him in to hear this. Go get him, then.

*The BAILIFF rushes off. When he reappears, he is escorting a young man in a suit and handcuffs. This is ART SCHWARTZ.*

**JUDGE:** Sit down.    
**ART:** Yes, your honor.

*ART sits down at a table. The JUDGE casts a pointed look at the FIRST JUROR.*

**JUDGE:** Okay. Go ahead.    
**JUROR #1:** We find the defendant... guilty.    
**JUDGE:** We will now proceed to sentencing. Mister Schwartz...    
**ART:** Yes?

*The JUDGE leans forward.*

**JUDGE:** Would you rather... go to jail for five years, but you can eat any meals you want... or go to jail for *one* year, but have to eat nothing but oatmeal?    
**ART:** Excuse me?    
**JUDGE:** Pick one.    
**ART:** Okay, well, uh... I guess I'd rather go to jail for one year, but have to eat oatmeal every day.

*The JUDGE bangs his gavel.*

**JUDGE:** So sentenced! Now, then: Would you rather share a cell with a nonviolent offender who hums all the time, or with a potentially unstable prisoner who's completely silent?    
**ART:** ... The silent one?    
**JUDGE:** Would you rather have unlimited Internet access, but the guards can see everything that you're doing... or only half an hour a day, unmonitored?    
**ART:** I'm sorry, is this...    
**JUDGE:** (*Interrupting*) Answer the question, or I will hold you in contempt of court!    
**ART:** I'm going to jail anyw... oh, whatever. Unlimited Internet access.    

*The JUDGE bangs his gavel again.*

**JUDGE:** Would you rather wear a standard orange jumpsuit or a grey one?    
**ART:** Are there downsides to either?    
**JUDGE:** No, the prison just offers both.

*ART considers this.*

**ART:** Don't I get a choice of prison?

*A murmur runs through the courtroom. The JUDGE bangs his gavel.*

**JUDGE:** Fine! *Fine!* Would you rather serve your time in... uh... in a regular prison, or at an island resort where you have to clean cruise ship bathrooms all day?    
**ART:** I'll take the resort. Actually, wait...

*The JUDGE interrupts ART by banging his gavel again.*

**JUDGE:** Would you rather...    
**ART:** (*Interrupting*) Wait, hang on.

*The BAILIFF smacks ART upside the head.*

**ART:** (*CONT'D*) Ow! I was just asking if my cellmate would still be there.    
**JUDGE:** Of course! Now! Would you rather have the option of early release, but have to work as a telemarketer during your parole... or spend the entire time in prison and receive a letter of recommendation afterward?    
**ART:** The latter.    
**JUDGE:** The letter?    
**ART:** Same thing. Yes.    
**JUDGE:** Excellent. Finally, Mister Schwartz...

*The JUDGE leans forward menacingly.*

**JUDGE:** (*CONT'D*) Would you rather accept this sentencing as it stands... or see what's behind door number two?

*The JUDGE gestures with his gavel to a closed door at the side of the courtroom. It becomes illuminated by hidden lights. Everyone in attendance starts shouting their advice.*

**ART:** Seriously?     
**JUDGE:** Ten seconds, Mister Schwartz!    
**ART:** I'll take the door, obviously.

*Everyone applauds.*

**JUDGE:** Let's see what's behind the door!

*The door swings open to reveal a parking lot.*

**JUDGE:** (*CONT'D*) Freedom! You win freedom!

*Applause breaks out. The BAILIFF steps forward.*

**BAILIFF:** Mister Schwartz, how did you know to pick the door?    
**ART:** It has an "Exit" sign over it.    
**JUDGE:** Damn! Well, the law is the law. Bailiff, release him!

*ART's handcuffs are removed.*

**JUDGE:** (*CONT'D*) Congratulations, Mister Schwartz... but don't you *dare* think about coming back tomorrow.    
**ART:** Would you rather I come back tomorrow but we televise the whole thing, or you never see me again and I don't break into celebrities' houses anymore?    
**JUDGE:** ... Nice try, Mister Schwartz.

*ART nods and walks through the door. Everyone applauds.*

**JUDGE:** Okay, next on the docket: The People Versus A Shoplifter. Bring in the obstacle course!

Score: 3306

These old eyes of mine have probably seen everything. I've seen species grow from single cells to monstrous, frighteningly smart creatures. I've seen civilizations rise, fall, rise again. Been a part of more than a few myself. I've been witness to every conflict I can imagine, from petty personal passive-aggression to skirmishes between tribes to planetary-scale turf wars all the way up to intergalactic grudges. Conflict never really changes, as far as I can tell. I've seen love, too. Not nearly enough of it, mind.

I've seen black holes form, nebulae birthing stars, solar systems spin from nonexistence into form. Cosmic dreamscapes and heavenly formations playing out in slow motion over billions, trillions of old Earth years. Can't say for sure how long I've watched the lights. I lose track of time as I float on.

"It'll never get old," I said once. "The universe. Massive, unpredictable, shining beauty that she is." Turns out someone, somewhere was listening - and they found it funny. When my time was up, when normally I'd finally be uncoiled from this mortality, I found myself sticking around. No light at the end of the tunnel, just a voice.

"THE UNIVERSE REPEATS. IN ITS INFINITY OF INFINITIES THERE IS NOTHING TRULY NEW. EVERYTHING THAT WAS, IS, WILL BE IS ALREADY OLDER THAN CAN BE EXPRESSED. YOU BELIEVE YOU WILL NEVER TIRE? PROVE THIS TO ME."

It's been a few cycles since then. The universe repeats, they said. That's true. I've seen all that anything can be, every possible configuration of atoms, strings, or whatever things really are deep down. I have literally seen *everything*.

It's a good thing I can't remember any of it.

See, the human mind is an interesting piece of hardware. Thrives on novelty. If you do one single thing enough times, you'll bore eventually. Whoever keeps me around here wagered that that'd hold true. The human mind only has so much storage, though. Only so many memories fit in the lump of meat and electricity. If you fill it up, every time you see something, every time you *perceive*, you'll lose something. It's like overfilling a bathtub. You add some water, some more splashes out.

Imagine that to infinity. My mind, cycling through the universe's water supply. Forgetting and making new memories. Every time I see completely alien art, every time I float through a cluster of stars, every time I love and lose and love again, I thrill.

It might not be *new*. But it's new to me.

Thank you to everyone who read this and enjoyed it. I only very recently began writing fiction, and I didn't expect so many people to respond so well to my early efforts. I'm still convinced that this whole thing was a combination of beginner's luck, a compelling prompt (thank you u/Gravitiaxis), and being in the right place at the right time.

#### Last sentence: "And the man with the mustache smiled."

Score: 3297

Living life as a turtle meant I could live a long time. I'd have plenty of time to accomplish all of my goals. Throughout my life I had gathered riches, built castles, and attained more power than any other turtle before me. That was all great, but what I wanted more than anything was a wife; someone to spend time with and care about. 

It was over twenty years ago when I found the woman of my dreams. However, she never loved me back. I tried desperately for years to get her to enjoy her time with me. I took her on all sorts of special dates-  underwater, in space, in one of my many homes. 

But every time I've tried to take her out, some god awful plumber shows up, occasionally bringing his good-for-nothing friends, and spoils my time. I haven't quite figured him out after all this time, but I think he's jealous of me. 

For example, last week I took the girl of my dreams for a go-kart ride up to my castle since she loves the view up there. Next thing I knew, the plumber found me and was trying to smash my head in with his feet! He stole my woman from me, and left me to die. My shell was cracked, my love was taken away again, and the man with the mustache smiled.

___________________________________________________________________________________________

You'd be surprised how easy it was to live in the world where superpowers were the norm. Even though I didn't have super powers, it was easy to get around, they didn't expect everyone to have super strength, or everyone to fly, so I was able to just always be the person who needed help. Nothing too bad. It was pretty annoying, not having a power that was useful, but I'd been dealing with it as long as I'd been alive, so I was surviving.

My power was increased perception, and minor at that. I could notice the pulled thread on anyone's sweater, I could see that someone had been crying the day before based on a slight difference in the colour of their eye. For all intents and purposes, I was just someone who paid attention, meanwhile my friend Todd could throw a car several city blocks, as long as he was with Laura.

Power was tied to your soul mate, which meant that as long as your soul mate was around, you were unbelievably more powerful, which meant that I would probably REALLY notice her. Not that it mattered, people usually didn't meet their soul mates, there were seven billion of us, and you only had one soul mate, chances were that she or he was somewhere in China, flying around or some shit.

So I kept watching the bubbles in my beer float up, I could tell you what speed they were going at, or what the other people were drinking based on the colour of their glass, but it was a party trick, "Toby," Todd cut in, "Earth to Toby."


"Present," I said, glancing up at him, his arm around Laura, showing off the relationship to everyone at the table.

"You excited to meet your soul mate?"

"Ha," I sat myself up so I was at least paying attention to him. He was taking the time and effort to set me up with one of his friends from work, I might as well try to seem interested. It wasn't easy to convince girls to date a guy who couldn't take them on a flight somewhere, "What's she like?"

"Dude, I've been telling you for the past hour,"

"Well I wasn't paying,"

"Yeah you were, you can't, not pay attention," he pointed out the flaw in my argument, "you just wanted to check if I could keep the story straight."

"Guilty."

"Well I'm telling you, she's hot and she sucks like you."

"Cool." I caught the glare from Laura on the hot comment, she was the kind of girl who checked your phone at night, "What time is she getting here?"

"Why don't you tell me, cowboy?" He said and then the door opened across the bar, I flicked my eyes over to look at who was walking in and caught her. To call her a smoke show would be a disservice to how hot she was. She was the kind of girl who got rejected from model shoots for making the rest of the girls look bad. If that was the girl that Todd had gotten for me, I needed to buy him tickets to the fucking Bahamas.

"Is that her at the door Todd?" There wasn't a response, "Earth to Todd?" Still no response, I looked over to him, blank-faced with a dumb smile, but not moving at all. I flicked my eyes over to the girl at the door, she was still walking in. I stood up to get to her.

"Hi," I said, holding out my hand to her, "I think you're stopping time or something by accident."

"I can't do that," she said with a smile, "pretty sure that's you."

"You know Todd?"

"Yeah."

"Well I'm Toby, and trust me, I can't do that either."

June went first - that was just her way. 

We both knew it was coming - well into our 90th year of life, having been together for 60, we may as well have been a single organism. Not a single person, alive or dead, knew either one of us better than we knew each other. 

"I'll be the first to go," she'd said suddenly. I had laughed and told her not to be silly, that I had to go first so she could be sure I actually did it. 

She'd simply smiled sadly, and patted my hand in a comforting way. 

"I'm serious, Jeb. I can feel it."

And she'd been right, as she always had. 

I had watched her slip away, watched her breathing grow shallower until her chest barely rose, then simply didn't rise again. 

My heart broke, and in that moment, I knew I wouldn't be far behind her. I stayed just long enough to make sure she passed comfortably.

"Don't worry, June," I'd thought to myself as I increased the morphine drip in my arm well past the overdose mark, "I'm right behind you." 

It's always been a cliché, but as I slipped from this life and departed for the next, I found myself in a bright tunnel. Light rushed towards me, and I could hear her calling to me, beckoning me forward. 

I reached the light, and everything went black. 

As I scrambled around in the darkness, a booming voice stopped me in my tracks. 

PRISONER 11384

YOUR LIFE SENTENCE FOR THE CRIME OF MURDER IS COMPLETE. 

YOU ARE FREE TO GO. 

I broke down in tears as the guards dragged me from my cell and tossed me to the pavement outside, as the memories flooded back and I understood the truth. 

I'd murdered June. I'd be obsessed with her, and heartbroken when I discovered her affections lay elsewhere. 

The punishment? To spend a lifetime seeing how things could have been.

Another gigantic hand hammered into John's shoulder, but this time he was ready and did not stumble. The crowd had roared with laughter when Vismar the Red had made Cena almost fall to the floor, as he had "merely" welcomed him with a clap on the back and John had not dared stumble since. 

These men, these gigantic men, they loomed over John and slopped their foul smelling alcohol on him as they cheered him and pulled him through the crowd. This was a dream, it must be a dream, but as tightly as he screwed his eyes up, or pinched himself, the world did not go away. 

John had always been one of the largest men in the room, but the average height here was approaching seven feet tall and the muscles were hard knots that had been earned by swinging heavy meta, not by pumping iron. it didn't make sense, none of it made sense, he was supposed to be flying to Orlando for a veterans match against Randy, not here, not... wherever he was. 

He looked down at his hands again, they were smooth and felt strong, like they had when he was twenty nine and at his physical peak. He flexed his fingers and watched as each muscle in his arm responded in kind, it was... incredible. His body was sculpted, tight, ready to go, he hadn't felt this good in... in decades.

***"JOHN CENA"*** The voice boomed across the room and made John's head snap up, he'd barely paid attention to where he was going since his arrival, but now the men in front cleared to the side and made a path. Ahead was a gigantic gilded throne and on it was the most massive man John had ever seen. 

The voice was like trucks accelerating in a tunnel, deep, booming and indicating incredible power. ***"GREETINGS JOHN OF CENA, YOU ARE MUCH WELCOMED HERE IN VALHALLA"*** 

The crowd was suddenly silent and the huge men seemed to be awaiting his response. He smiled weakly. "Okay, hi." There was a moment's pause and the crowd roared in laughter. 

On his throne the huge man wiped away a tear and nudged the man nearest him ***"FORSOOTH! CLASSIC CENA, JUST CLASSIC!"*** 

The men still laughed and John  looked around, confused. "I don't... I don't really get it. What's going on here?" 

Finally the laughter subsided and the huge man controlled himself. ***"VERILY, I AM SORRY JOHN, WE SHOULD NOT LAUGH, BUT WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU FOR MANY YEARS IN YOUR BATTLES AND... WELL, WE'RE PRETTY HUGE FANS."*** 

This place was getting to him; John slowly turned and took it in. there were faces all around, bright and eager to hear what he had to say, but... they were warrior men, huge leather-bound and covered in scars. He'd come here on a horse with a fat woman and he was in the body he'd owned many year ago. "I'm dead?" 

There was a silence and the room was suddenly filled with eyes that would not meet his. ***"INDEED, I KNOW THAT IT IS HARD FOR A WARRIOR TO ACCEPT, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO VALHALLA MY SON, WHERE THE REWARD FOR A LIFE TIME OF BATTLES IS TO  FEAST AT THE SIDE OF ODIN!"*** 

Slowly things began to make sense to John - this was a gig. He'd seen these expressions day in and day out on the road, wide eyed and excited. These were *fans* and he was here to perform. Dead, dreaming, it didn't matter, all that mattered was that he was here to entertain. For forty three years John had stepped into the ring and left it all out there and now it was time to do it again. 

The crowd had begun to murmur, but silence sharply fell as his hand shot into the air, fingers splayed. With great care, John reached down and deliberately paused, before pumping up his sneakers twice and then jumping to his feet. 

"You brought me here to Feast Odin? You think I want to spend me days getting fat and slow? What? You wanna go? I'm here to battle, I'm here to fight, you betta take fright, because I'm Mister Friday Night!" The old words came back easily, the promo flowing as it always had. 

Odin leaned over to the man nearest him and whispered excitedly. ***"THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD, LOOK, HE'S GETTING ALL WORKED UP AND HE'S..."*** John ripped off his shirt. ***"OOH, I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DO THAT, I TOTALLY WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY IT."*** 

"Stuff that old man, I came here to *get busy* and all I see here are a bunch of old men and..." he paused and confusion crept into his voice. "What looks to be my accountant Ted in the corner." Ted waved miserably to John. "So am I gonna get a match or what?" 

Odin smiled widely. ***"INDEED JOHN, WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR MANY YEARS. AS ONE OF THE BRAVEST WARRIORS IN EARTH'S HISTORY, WE HAVE PREPARED A MATCH SUITABLE TO YOUR LEVEL."*** 

The crowd parted again and a gigantic man walked forward, over eight feet tall and with muscles bigger than John's head. His sword was nearly five feet long and seemed to split the air with a slight tearing noise. He was bound from head to foot in spiked metal armor, with only his face showing, allowing John to see his scarred face, teeth sharpened to spikes and a demonic smile. 

Odin waved his hand casually. ***"OF COURSE, IT WILL NEED TO BE A BATTLE WITH SOMETHING ON THE LINE, SO WE WILL PIT YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL AGAINST KRATHNAR THE INVINCIBLE'S. OH AND HONESTLY JOHN, WE'RE SUPER EXCITED FOR THIS, WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AGES, SO TRY NOT TO FINISH HIM OFF TOO QUICKLY."*** 

John deflated, "Wait, what? What do you mean immortal soul?" 

***"OH DON'T WORRY, HE'S NO UNDERTAKER, JUST PUT ON A QUICK MATCH, BREAK HIM IN TWO AND WE CAN GET TO FEASTING. WATCH OUT FOR THAT SWORD THOUGH, IT'S DAMN SHARP." Odin chuckled. "NOT THAT YOU'LL BE WORRIED I'M SURE."***

John backed away. "And I don't get a weapon at all?" 

The crowd roared with laughter and even Krathnar smiled. Odin leaned forward with a grin ***"OH JOHN, ALWAYS WITH THE QUIPS. CLASSIC CENA"***

#### [WP] A man orders a "cheese pizza with no crust" from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine.

Score: 3217

At the sound of the doorbell, I heaved myself from my seat. 

I moved over to the door, ready to go on an angry rant about the time. Who the hell thought two in the morning was a good time to turn up at your house? They could’ve woken me up! They didn’t, but they could’ve, and it’s the thought that counts.

I opened the door and my words died on my lips. A man in a pizza deliveryman’s costume stood there, smoking a cigarette and flanked by two burly men in tracksuits. Behind them, a bright red SUV was parked, its lights off but engine still gently running.

“Uh…hi?”

The pizza man dropped his cigarette. “Show us the money first.”

I glanced around. “Am…am I being robbed?”

The man snorted. “Robbed? Hell no. We’ve got the best prices around.”

I looked at the symbol on the man’s hat and came to a sudden realisation. “You’re from Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour!”

“Hell yeah, I am. Now where’s the money?”

“I called you guys six hours ago.” Prank-called them, to be specific, asking for a ridiculous order. Come to think of it, I hadn’t even given them my address.

The pizza man snorted. “What, you thought we were gonna come in broad daylight? And people don’t normally ask for such massive amounts.”

“I only asked for a cheese pizza with no crust.”

“Man, what do you mean ‘only’? It would take years to get through a cheese pizza without the crust. What do you normally buy?”

I rolled my eyes. “A Hawaiian pizza with no cheese or pineapple.”

The pizza man’s eyes widened. “Holy shit, dude. Are you some kind of millionaire?” He turned back to one of the men. “This guy’s a real buyer; go get the product.”

The man nodded and headed back to the SUV. He rooted around in it for a minute before turning the lights on, revealing a myriad of logos for Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour that I somehow hadn’t seen before.

He returned soon, clutching a briefcase, which he handed to the pizza man, who laid it on the floor and clicked it open, revealing a pristine pizza box. Slowly and carefully, he stood, and then handed it to me.

“It’s all in there, dude.”

What the hell were these guys on about? I opened the box.

 “Guys, I didn’t order a box of flour.”

#### [WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?

Score: 3211

So get a load of this. I had this idea.  I was thinking, how am I going to kill one of the most antagonistic political figures of the 20th century?   
I thought, hey, a sperm whale---   
It started with a sperm whale anyway. I was just going to drop a *sperm whale* on him. Then I realized, I wasn't going to get points just for subtelty or difficulty. *Anyone* can drop something on someone. Hell, the third winner used an ambulance. Points for creativity *and* irony that year.   
Then, I figured it out. An *homage* to the old days of this noble sport.   
So I went back to a further time, earlier in the era. Found this old man, and asked him what he thought of some paintings I brought with me.   
Here's where we pick up the pace.     
I asked him about *Adolf Hitler's* paintings. He thought out loud as old men always do (even in the 20th century!) and said, he never heard of him, but the painting technique was "disappointing."  
Then I asked him to repeat himself, and say, "Adolf Hitler's art, was disappointing."    
So he did.  
I asked him to *yell* it, tell all who would hear a master's opinion of this work.   
*JUST* as he was about to respond, I teleport him over Hitler making a public speech in Berlin three decades later. You can see this old man *zooming* down into the sky. In the tape, you can barely see Hitler raise his eyebrows. *That's* when he realizes someone was yelling his name from above.  
You have no idea how difficult it was calculating the *exact* velocity to get the old man's adrenaline going, give him time to speak, and have Hitler hear him.  
And there! That's how I pulled it off.  
I killed Adolf Hitler by dropping his painting idol, Rudolf von Alt, far above his head, *while* he was yelling out his opinion of Hitler's paintings for all of Berlin to hear. It was the last thing he ever heard.    
And Rudolf called his paintings *crap!*  
The bonus points for intricacy *and* emotional devastation got me the victory.

#### [WP] Today everyone woke up with price tags floating over their heads, indicating the value of their life. Your tag is $50Tn, the biggest by far, and you have no idea why.

Score: 3115

When people asked why I’m worth so much, I shrugged. I mean, what am I supposed to say? It’s a question as random as: “why are your eyes blue?” or “how’d you get to be so tall?”. There’s no right way to answer it without bullshitting.

Sure, I could say it’s genetics, but I highly doubt that. My father’s a farmer and is married to a stay-at-home mom. They’re nice people, of course, but nice doesn’t seem to correlate to value. They both barely scratch a hundred thousand dollars combined.

I could say it was a mistake. After all, there wasn’t always an explanation. Most people who did stand out were famous in some facet but every once in a while, a baby was born with an exceptional price. I feel bad for them. They have to live a life of everyone bearing down on them to reach their full potential. I’m just lucky that I’m already in my twenties and a somewhat established carpenter.  It pays the bill and that’s all I need.

That was, until I gained worldwide recognition.

Ever since I’ve been valued at fifty trillion – yes, you read it right – people have been treating me a lot differently. Old friends, past girlfriends, and annoying family members have popped out of the woodwork like crazy to capitalize on my newfound fame. Suddenly, I was desirable because of the unknown. And as far as they knew, it was better to make friends than enemies.

I became the focus of many scientists. They figured if I didn’t have political, monetary, or social power, it must have been something inside me that was unique. A series of tests were run on my body, analyzing every single cell for what makes me tick. The results were a little… *unsatisfactory*.

Superior athletic ability? Nope.

Cancer-resistant genes? Unfortunately, no.

Unexplainable superpowers? Only in my dreams.

After wearing me to the bone with tests and sucking me dry of blood, they gave up their attempts. As far as they could tell, I was an enigma no one knew how to solve. And at the rate they were going, I was going to be long dead before they made any headway.

Then the paparazzi came into play. Do you know what it’s like being stalked by a gaggle of sleazebags with cameras who have no sense of personal space? I have one word for it – shitty.

Well, one day, I was jogging at the nearby park. In hindsight, it was stupid, but I thought it was safe enough. I never expected them to swarm me like a cloud of bees. But by the time they surrounded me, it was too late to get away.

So I did what any reasonable person would, I sprinted like hell. In fact, I ran so fast that I didn’t even notice I was on a direct course for the pond in front of me. By the time I realized, I already had one foot on the surface of the water.

And then another.

Before I knew it, I was *running* on water. It wasn’t a mind-trick, at least not as far as I could tell. I was actually doing it of my own accord.

I turned back to the paparazzi. They were momentarily stunned but started to snap photos again. After all, they had to get the perfect shot. It would be the height of anyone’s career once it reached the tabloids.

Everyone wants to see the first photo proof of the Second Coming.

#### [WP] Your roommate is literally the Devil. Surprisingly, he is the best roommate you ever had.

Score: 3088

I pulled the cellophane-wrapped pieces of meat from out of the fridge and checked the label. Useless, of course. Though I was grateful that Satan always kept the fridge fully stocked, I just wish that he would go to a grocery store that sold things in English. Everything that he brought home was marked with like, ancient Sumerian cuneiform or something. 

"Satan, what is this?" I asked, holding up the package over the counter in the kitchen so that he could see it from the living room. He looked just like any other guy. Tall, kind of lanky, with black hair and black eyes. Not breathtakingly handsome, but not too bad either. And when he spoke, he had just the slightest hint of an accent that I just couldn't quite place. Probably because it wasn't from anywhere on Earth. 

He was deep into a game of Battlefront, enjoying frying some rebel scum as the Emperor. You'd think he'd get tired of that sort of thing (given what he does for a living) but apparently not. "Uhh, what does it look like?" he asked, not taking his eyes off of the screen. 

I looked back down at the pieces of meat. It was pinkish. "It looks like pork chops," I told him. 

"Gah!" he shook the controller violently; someone had killed his character. Finally he looked up at the package in my hands with a swift glance. "Yeah, totally pork," he answered.

"You sure?" There were some parcels in the fridge marked "DO NOT EAT" (in English, for me) that he got for his demon friends that occasionally came over. And they looked *very* similar to pork. 

He squinted at the cuneiform writing. "Yeah, it's pork."

"Cool." I ripped open the packaging and put a pat of butter into a pan. "You want some dinner too? Cider-glazed pork chops?"

"Sounds awesome!" he said, going back to his game. 

I hummed as I cooked. It had been a long time since I'd done that. There was just something so comforting about listening to the sizzling pan, mixed with the sound of explosions and blaster fire coming from the TV (as well as some intermittent shouting from Satan as his Tie fighter was shot down). And the smell of the onions sauteing. And the warmth coming from the pan. It just felt... like home. 

There was a loud thumping on the door, like someone was trying to get in with a battering ram. Satan glanced at me with a quizzical look, then towards the door. "I got it," He got up from the couch just as I started to move away from the pan. "You keep an eye on my dinner," he said with a grin. 

I heard the creak of hinges, followed shortly by Tom's voice. My blood ran cold immediately. "Where's Sarah?" he shouted at Satan. 

"And who might you be?" Satan answered calmly. I had told him about the situation when I moved in, of course. That I'd just gotten out of a relationship, and that it hadn't exactly ended well. But I really hadn't gone into all the details about *why* we'd broken up, and *how* Tom had acted when I finally broke the news to him. Satan didn't need to know that. That was between me, Tom, and the cops who had responded that night. 

"Her *boyfriend*," Tom answered. Even without seeing him, I could tell that he was itching to pick a fight. "Now *where is she?* We need to talk."

"You know," Satan told him, "I don't think she really wa..."

"It's ok," I interrupted him, coming into the hallway behind Satan. "It's fine. We can talk."

Tom had a smug grin on his face, and he glared at Satan. "Yeah. We just need to talk. So butt out."

Satan was still standing between the two of us. He glanced at me with his thick black eyebrows arched, silently asking 'you sure you're ok with this?' I gave him a very slight nod, and he backed away and let me pass into the doorway. 

Once Satan went back into the living room, Tom grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me out onto the porch. He reached around me and slammed the door shut. "What the *fuck*, Sarah? You're *already* shacking up with some other guy?"

"We're not *shacking up!*" I shouted back at him, though my voice was breaking with fear. "He's just my *roommate*."

Tom scoffed. "Yeah, *bullshit*. Was this already going on when we were dating?" He clenched his teeth and breathed heavily through his nostrils. "I swear, Sarah, if you were cheating on me..."

"I *just* told you," I shouted back at him, "There's nothing going on between us! And besides, it's none of your business. I *dumped you*, remember?"

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw his hand clench into a fist, and rage flashed through his eyes. My body tensed up involuntarily, expecting the blow.

The front door swung open again. "All right, buddy. Time for you to go," Satan told Tom. "*NOW*."

"Or what?" Tom asked, puffing out his chest and turning away from me. "You going to call the cops? Why don't we settle this like men?" He cracked his knuckles and grimaced, as if he wasn't being clear enough already.

Satan stepped out onto the porch with an affable smile. "Gladly," he answered. "Except..." 

He began to grow. It was hardly noticeable at first, but he was Tom's height in just a matter of seconds, whereas he'd been at least three inches shorter when he stepped through that doorway. And not just up, but *out*. Muscles bulged from his arms and chest and legs until he looked like a bodybuilder. His pale skin turned fire-engine red, and a bristly black goatee sprouted from his chin in a matter of seconds. His affable smile became horrifying and menacing when his teeth became sharpened fangs. And, as a nice little cherry on top, thick ram's horns sprouted from his forehead and spiraled out until the spiky tips were jutting into Tom's face.

"Except I'm *not* a man," he boomed in a terrifyingly deep voice.

Tom bolted back to his car with a wet stain on his crotch. He didn't even *look* at me. 

"What's the matter?" Satan crowed after him. "I thought you wanted to settle this!" His taunt was answered by the squeal of tires, and a crash as Tom reversed out of his parking spot and straight into the back of another car in the lot. Satan let out a deep, booming laugh and put one massive arm over my shoulder. "Come on, Sarah. We wouldn't want dinner to burn." He led me back inside, and slowly transformed back into his human self.

"I'm sorry you had to see that," he finally told me.

"No, I..." I really didn't have words. Tears began to roll down my cheeks. "No, *I'm* sorry. For Tom. And for not telling you what an asshole he was. And.. and... thank you, so much. You just... *God*, I'd give anything for a drink right now."

Satan smirked. "I told you not to use that name in this house." He crossed the room and found a bottle of white wine in the fridge, then poured me a glass.

I reached out to take it, but he jerked it away quickly. "Ah ah ah! Not so fast." He twirled the stem of the glass deftly between his fingers. "You said you'd give *anything* for a drink?" His smile became wicked and devious. "How about *your soul*?"

I stared at him in shock, unsure how to respond. As soon as he revealed who he really was, I *knew* this day would come eventually. I just hadn't thought it would be *now*. All I could think of was that the onions were starting to burn.

"Nah, I'm just fucking with you," he laughed, handing me the drink.

I woke up and had a small panic attack - my breathing was impaired, and I felt my lungs once again struggling from the residue left from a serious Candy Cane Cigar addiction. After a small while, however, I calmed down. My lungs weren't acting up - it was a gas mask on me that was restricting my breath.

A week since I woke up alone, the last of my kind. I don't know why I didn't wake up when the gas mask was put on. I suppose I was too tired from a night of binge drinking "Kidz Champaign". 

A week since I decided on my final purpose - revenge, revenge on those terrorist scum for taking my life away, for leaving me a marked man to trek this world of candy alone.

Because if there was on last thing I was going to do, it was make sure that I got revenge. Be it a year - be it a decade, be it five, I would kill those men. No matter how much time it took, they would get their *just desserts*.

In his place, a gray-haired, crooked-nose witch in black robes and a pointy hat hovered a few feet from the ground, green smoke rising from the wood under her feet.

"Told ya! The captain be a witch!"

"Why?"

"Cause I be a witch too." Fatman said, turning to a witch not unlike the Captain in front of the other's eyes.

"You be a witch? Then why you be arguing that there is witches in pirate stories?" The Captain asked. "Why you

"I be trying to throw you off," Fatman-now-witch replied.

"I'll be darned, me too," One-Legged Jimmy joined, turning into a witch himself.

"Well that makes four of us," Bald Nick intervened, as he too turned to a pointy-hatted old lady.

The four witches exchanged looks. "Guess witches be pretty common in pirate stories, heh?"

"Aye."

"Aye."

"Aye."

From his corner, Golden-Tooth Jackson's eyes were wide like the full moon above.

#### [WP] Everyone is born with a disability and an ability. A test is done at birth to determine these, if they aren't already apparent. You, well, you were born with crippled legs and have the power of super speed.

Score: 3000

See, what most people don't realise about super speed is that it doesn't just affect your legs. Your entire body moves fast. People never tend to get that because you see guys like Ravel Alton sprinting at three hundred kilometres an hour down the speedway. I mean, it's more impressive *visually* than what I can do... but I like to think that my abilities are still pretty good.

"Checkmate," I smile, knocking over the white king with my own rook. Valentin, my opponent, stares at me in shock. By the look on his face, my guess is that his ability was mind-reading. It's a good way to become a chess champion, I'll give him that. 

But he can't keep up with me.

See, from the femtosecond his finger touched the first piece, I started running through the possible moves in my head. All of them. 

Do you know how many possible positions there are after each player moves three times? More than 9 million. That goes up to 288 billion after four moves each. But when you can't move without a wheelchair, and when you have a brain that can scan and memorise information faster than anything else on the planet... and when you also have a lot of time on your hands... you can memorise everything. Every perfect game. 

Not to mention, of course... Valentin might be able to read minds. But he can't process information as fast as I can. Which leaves him unable to comprehend the million, million, million thoughts I have every nanosecond.

I can't run. But that doesn't mean I'm not *fast*.

#### [WP] You're the person who keeps mowing lawns during the zombie apocalypse of The Walking Dead.

Score: 2970

Everyone in the world has lost their minds. Literally: it infected our blood and then spread to the cerebellum. We lost ourselves.

Hardly a surprise, though. Looting, rioting, murdering, cannibalism... hard to *keep* your mind in that kind of environment, much less be happy, right? Happiness vanished from the world.

Except for in me.

I was bitten almost three months ago. God, has it really been that long? I watched the whole neighborhood go to shit, utterly terrified and panicked like everyone else. One by one, the neighbors turned. We watched out of the second story window, because the downstairs was all boarded up. We saw old Mr. Howard biting little Linda Root right there in the street. My family and I watched her corpse bleed out onto the sidewalk, then get back up again an hour later and start roaming the street. 

I still don't know how they got to my wife. All I know is that I came back from a supply run, opened up the garage door, and found her sinking her teeth into my shoulder. And that was the end, I thought.

The end. In just a few short hours, I'd be one of them. I could take my own life, of course: it wasn't an unpopular decision. Better than trying to feast on your remaining friends as a ghoul, right? But I couldn't do it. I was a coward. So I did what any man would do: popped open a beer and fired up the riding lawnmower. 

For some people, it's basking on a sandy beach with a margarita in hand. For other people, it's jumping out of a plane and plummeting toward the ground until they finally pull that ripcord. For my wife, it was exploring every damn store in the mall for the hundredth time. Everyone has their "zen" activity, and mine was mowing the lawn. She was my pride and joy, and it showed in the lush green color. 

It was dark by the time I'd finished up. The rest of the zombies around me could smell the bite. They knew I wasn't long for the world, so they left me alone. Just me and John Deere against the world. I may die soon, but my lawn would live on as a testament to my abilities. Years from now, when the world is reclaimed, someone will come by and say, "Wow, the grass here is shorter and neater than any of the other lots." That would be my legacy.

But somehow... nothing was happening. No fever, no dizziness... none of the symptoms anyone else experienced after a bite. I felt better than ever (though that might have been from the beer, and maybe a touch of sun stroke).

I crawled into bed, at least happy that I'd managed to enjoy my one last day on Earth. I'd probably turn in the night, so I handcuffed myself to the bed frame. One less walker for the survivors to worry about, I guess.

I woke up the next morning with the sun in my eyes and the smell of freshly-caught grass wafting through the window. Well, freshly cut grass and rotting flesh. But we can't have *everything*, can we? The important part was that I hadn't turned yet. Susan had *definitely* bitten me; I had the marks to prove it. And she was *definitely* infected. So what was it?

I fired up the lawnmower again. My lawn was already perfect, but Dr. Metnis's lawn hadn't seen care in weeks. He was one of the first on the block to go. Probably one of the first in the state; he'd been at the hospital when the initial outbreak occurred. One of the very first patients had taken a chunk out of his hand, and we hadn't seen him since. So, I rode over and cut his grass too (and had a few more beers; why fix what ain't broken?).

The bite seemed to be healing. It was something about the lawns. About how it calmed me down. As best I can guess, with my *very* rudimentary knowledge of chemistry and biology, it's the adrenaline. *Fear* is what sets off the virus. No one has noticed so far because *of course* everyone who has been bitten was freaking out. *Everyone* is terrified nowadays. Murderous, bloodthirsty ghouls, constantly being on the run, fearing for your life from other survivors... there is no more safety for anyone, and thus no more immunity. And the closer someone gets to death, the more they panic, which just speeds up the virus. My final zen ritual of mowing the lawn seems to have saved my life.

So I did what any reasonable man would do: I kept mowing. If I needed to stay calm to avoid setting off the virus, then I needed more lawns, and more beer. So I cleared highway medians on my way between supply runs. I groomed the lawns of homes before looting their supply cupboards. I cleaned up city parks before taking what I needed from stores and pharmacies. 

Someday, there will be a cure. I have to have hope that someone out there is working on it; it's all about keeping that positive, zen state of mind. In the meantime, I need to keep going. Luckily for me, there's plenty of grass in America.

#### [WP] Two immortals meet and fall in love. Neither of them are aware of the other's immortality and the years are flying by...

Score: 2920

Life is but a fleeting breath


For one as old as I


Each passing year, a passing day


Alone, for to love...is to watch love die



Then I met her, my perfect match


The yin unto my yang


She sang to me a perfect song



And to her, my heart sang its true reply 



Alas, our days must be so short



They say that time must fly



All good things come to an end



Soon, we will say our last goodbye





I cannot bear to see her go



I cannot watch her die



And so I fled, a shadow in the night



My deepest love a fading sigh



I pray, to whatever gods might hear



That at the end of days



When all the world is said and done


Somehow, she might return my gaze



Time will be time, and as time does



It turned forever more



Empires grew, and nations fell



And yet my heart would never soar



Soon, all was gone, the world was bare



In the blinking of an eye



And there, among the wreckage, stood



The one I sought, a shadow on the sky



The gods had heard my prayer, it seemed


With their power beyond supreme


Her eyes still clear, her face still young


A living, breathing dream



"Why did you leave?" she asked at last


"I've waited all this time"


In answer, I just shook my head


There were no words to fix my crime


"Nothing I can say or do could undo what I've done



To leave you far behind


I know now I should not have run



Forgive me, for I have been blind."




She stopped a moment, hand outstretched


Fate balanced on a dime


And though I have lived for eons since


Those few moments stretched far beyond Time



"I forgive you" were her next words



The sweetest ever heard



She took my hand into her own



And between us, eons blurred



So now we walk, never apart


Through sand and wind and rain



For though the world has breathed its last



Our Love does live again

Score: 2912

Elizabeth stepped out from the wall and snapped the neck of the guard as he walked past. The guy never had a chance.  
Catching his assault rifle before it hit the floor, she lowered his body to the ground and dragged it to an alcove, out of the main corridor.  
Five soldiers down now; only ten remained between her and the ambassador. 
As she slipped through the militarised embassy, she reflected on how she had got here - how much simpler life had been just a few months ago.  

&nbsp;  
Liz had started out as a hairdresser, but quickly became disenchanted by the business. Getting to the second level was simple enough - she just had to do enough bowl-cuts - but once she saw the styles progression tree laid out before her, she realised that this wasn't what she wanted to do with her life. Sure, she might one day style for the stars, but that would be small consolation for the time and energy invested.  
It was by chance she saw the man on her way back from the salon. Under normal circumstances she shouldn't have even been able to detect his presence - even with his guard down, it was virtually a miracle.  
"You have the *gift*" he told her, "otherwise we would never have met. You shall become my apprentice."  

&nbsp;  
Two guards fell to quickly timed blows to the neck. Again, they hadn't noticed her until it was far, far to late. Incapacitated, she cuffed them with their own equipment, then pushed them into a small office and locked the door.  
Her mentor would have been proud. She was doing well.  
Voices came down the corridor and she ghosted up to a pot plant, then became *one* with the indoor palm. The squad of mercenaries ran right past her and she slipped from cover, continuing on towards her target.  
She became lost in her recollections again.

&nbsp;  
"You might have the gift, but you do not practice enough!" snarled her mentor.  
Shamed, she stared hopelessly at the man, his beret waggling as he shook his head.  
"I'll... I'll try harder," she offered.  
"No, you must go out into the world and hone your skills in the field, only then will you become a master of our craft."  
With that, he had vanished, never to be seen again. Elizabeth had cried, raged and pleaded, but Master Rene had never returned.  

&nbsp;  
Bullets flashed around her.  
*Shit!*  
She hadn't expected there to be auto-turrets. She could fool the minds of men, but not machines.  
Panting, she composed herself and *focussed.*  
Five deep breaths and she stood, then placed her hands in the air in front of her, moving slowly forward.  
Bullets rattled and careened off the force-field in front of her, the metal slugs impacting on the invisible wall as she carefully crab-stepped through the room.  
After a fraught sixty seconds, she was *through* - unscathed by the automatic fire from the twin machine gun turrets.  
The door to the ambassador's chamber stood before her.
No doubt it would be trapped.  
Standing clear, she carefully shaped her hands and started to *pull*.  
As though guided by invisible hands, the heavy door began to open.  
Straining, Liz hauled hand over hand until the door stood open - and a fan of poison darts shot from the lintel, where she would have been standing.  
Inside the ambassador cowered behind his desk, a gun in his meaty hand.  
"Where are you!" cried the plump man, "who are you?"  
Liz allowed herself to be seen.  
Terror washed over the man's face as he gazed upon her beret, her suspenders, her white face-paint and black slacks.  
"Oh my god," he whined.  
Liz smiled viciously.  
No one escaped a *grandmaster mime*.

#### [EU] The Iron Giant is thrown into the world of Pacific Rim

Score: 2902

The year was 2026. It had been nearly 2 years since we destroyed the portal between our world and that of those creating the Kaiju clones. The Jaeger program had been largely shut down following the news that the Kaiju’s means of entry into our world had been destroyed, but the units still in existence following The War were kept in cold-storage in the event of Kaiju once again finding a way to our world. A treaty had been signed between all those nations either with Jaeger programs, or those actively supporting them, stating that a defensive pact be made ensuring that in the event of a Kaiju resurgence all international differences be put aside for the survival of the race.

Unexpectedly, in December of 2026 well over a dozen Kaiju emerged from the ocean on the East coast of America near Maine, far more than had ever been seen at one time. Without any warning the nations of the world were unable to mobilize their Jaegers before the Kaiju started laying waste to cities. Within 24 hours over 500,000 people were dead or missing. Then, an unidentified mech, totally unlike any of the Jaegers developed by any country with active programs, appeared seemingly out of nowhere. This machine’s weapons and defenses were entirely unlike anything developed in any known program; extremely adaptive and energy absorbent hull, and advanced energy weapons including particle beams, matter displacement arrays, high-explosive flechette rounds, and a monstrously powerful plasma weapon with an ordinance close to 8,000 kilotons and a range of several miles. This giant, although only around 50 meters tall as compared to Cherno Alpha or Coyote Tango’s 85 meters, put up one of the most one-sided fights we had ever seen against any Kaiju, let alone that many. The world stood in awe of this beast, easily the most advanced piece of weaponry known to mankind.

Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, America had met this machine nearly 70 years ago, in 1958. It had “gone rogue” in a small Maine town, laying waste to the large military detachment sent in response to its discovery, and was subsequently destroyed with nuclear ordinance. This was passed off as a test firing internationally. The re-emergence of the “Iron Giant”, as it had come to be called, was a massive shock to the US government. There was some belief that this was not the same machine, but a similar model, but upon dispatching the Kaiju it began asking for someone named “Hogarth”.  The name was tracked down to be Hogarth Hughes, a 77 year old man living in the same small town as the original “Iron Giant” encounter. Unfortunately, one of the earlier Kaiju attacks targeted this town and Hogarth was never found. Upon hearing this news the “Iron Giant” went into a rage and dove deep into the Atlantic off the coast of Maine. Probes sent to the newly opened portal reported seeing the machine entering it with all weapons active. 28 hours later the portal closed.

It has been nearly 30 years since the “Iron Giant” closed the portal, and not once has there been any sign of the Kaiju or their creators. 

Wherever you are Iron Giant, the hearts of Humanity go out to you.

"Father, is there *anything* that the Church can do at this phase? We've already lost about one quarter of the American population."

"I'm sorry, Mr. President," the Pope responded in heavily accented English. "But there is nothing to be done! And why would you want to? *Everyone* will be joining the Kingdom of Heaven, and of course people want to ascend as quickly as possible. These are the end times, but instead of the disaster that so many had predicted, it is a glorious reunion with God!"

"Think about what this means for anyone who chooses to stay, though! We've got people here blowing up planes and malls, and being honored as heroes! Just yesterday, my Secretary of the Interior murdered his entire family, then killed himself. It's a madhouse! Some people are not convinced, and they should not be taken against their will."

"What does any of that matter? Why would they *want* to stay? " the Pope said sharply. "They should welcome God's forgiveness despite their stubbornness. In fact, everyone should be taking such steps and trying to take the unfaithful to Heaven with them! The only reason that I and the rest of the Church have remained on Earth is to shepard the remaining non-believers into the Kingdom. We're even receiving masses of converts from the Middle East and China, pledging their faith just before killing themselves!"

"What if the scientists are wrong though? What if there was something off about their results?"

The pope scoffed audibly. 

"Mr President, for *centuries*, the Church has endured the scorn of the scientific community. We have repeatedly tried to tell people to have faith that God will take care of them in the afterlife. Lately, it has gotten worse and worse! More and more 'miracles' being disproved by your scientific community, more and more of the Biblical story being disproven by archaeologists and historians..." The Pope's accent became thicker and thicker as he got angrier. "And *now* that we have science on our side, you're asking me if I'm *sure*? Now that we have had *multiple* people brought back from the dead and they described their experiences in Heaven? Now that we've even been able to communicate with the other side? *NOW* you ask me to doubt science? No, sir. I will continue my work on this Earth, and I hope that I am the last to go. I will not help you keep your citizens tethered to this mortal plane."

The phone clicked, and the president was left listening to the dial tone. First time anyone had hung up on him in years.

"God damn it," the President said, putting his elbows on the heavy wooden desk in the Oval Office and resting his forehead in his palms. "You're good. You really nailed it this time."

"Thank you," Satan replied humbly from the cream-colored couch in the center of the room. "I was pretty proud of this plan as well."

Score: 2800

Harry sat alone. The house that once housed  Ginny and his children was near empty. Ginny had passed a year ago, and he had to admit it had taken something out of him. He had lost so many people, but this had struck him hard. 

He thought of his children. They all had families of their own, and they were supposed to be visiting soon. He sighed.

No one knew he was sick. Ron knew, but he made him swear on his life not to tell anyone. He'd had a good life, and he wanted to go without a fuss. Enough close brushes with death had made him want to go quietly.

He wanted some tea, but he felt too weak to get up. He took out his wand, then stopped. He held the old, etched wood in his hands, then lightly made sparks fly out of the tip.

He smiled. He always loved how still, so many years later, magic still amazed him. 

Suddenly, his scar hurt. 

He wasn't alarmed by it, nor by the man who had appeared in the corner of the room.

It was Tom Riddle. Not snake-like, pale, and red-eyed. Human. He smiled, not menacingly, but warmly.

"Hello, Harry."

Harry smiled as well. "Nice to see you again, Tom."

"Is it nice? I was never much of a warm presence when I was among the living. I hurt many people. But most of all, I tried to hurt you. It's ironic that you were among the few who saw me as Tom Riddle, rather than Lord Voldemort."

"Fear can drive you mad," said Harry. "I've seen it many times."

Tom Riddle smiled again, somewhat sadly. "Harry, we've got to go."

Harry looked at him. There were tears in his eyes.

"I'm scared." he said.

"I know." said another voice.

Harry turned. It was Ginny. He gasped.

Behind her stood every person he had ever loved and lost. Hagrid, and Dumbledore, and  Dobby, and Lupin and Tonks and Snape and Cedric and Sirius and even the Dursleys. His parents stood next to Ginny, smiling. 

"We're with you, Harry." his mother said softly.

Harry turned to Riddle.

Tom stuck out his hand. "Come, Harry."

Harry laughed, tears in his eyes, his scar burning, as he grabbed Riddle's hand, and then left this world together with Death, as equals.

Shreds of wrapping paper flew through the air as Gary tore into yet another box. His parents watched from the couch, wide-eyed and amazed at the ever-growing mountain of wrapping paper and ribbons and bows in the center of their living room. And not to mention the thousands and thousands of dollars worth of toys that had miraculously appeared under the Christmas tree last night. 

"Did you win the lottery or something and not tell me?" Martin whispered to his wife. "Where did all of this come from?" They'd been scrimping and saving for *months* to buy Gary that new video game system that he wanted... and they'd still been about a hundred bucks short by the time Christmas came around. So they got him a new bike instead. But not the insanely expensive one that he'd unwrapped first; *that* had been a shock. 

Nancy couldn't even answer. Her eyes were glistening and her smile wavered as Gary brought a present over to her: a slender box, wrapped in green-and-blue striped paper. "I asked Santa for something for you too, Mommy." Tears rolled down her cheeks as she accepted it and managed to thank her son. She opened the box to reveal a diamond necklace that would have looked at home around the Queen of England's neck. Her jaw dropped and she turned to Martin, who was also speechless.

"What's this, Mommy?" They managed to turn away from the sparkling diamonds for long enough to see what had come out of the very large box in the center of the room: some sort of... table.

It was made of glistening black stone that seemed to suck in light. There were deep scarlet candles lining the perimeter, and in the center there was a bone-white sheep's skull grinning back at them. Except the eyes were glowing red, like they were full of fire.

"Honey," Nancy said, dropping the diamond necklace and getting up from the couch as quickly as she could, "Don't touch that. You don't know wha..."

"Dear Gary," he read from a card, completely ignoring his mother's instructions. "I hope you ejn... enjoy all the presents. Just make sure to stad... stand at the table and read this incatnation... incantation when you're done, and we'll call it even." Gary squinted at the paper as his mother tried to tear it out of his hands. "Ut veinma pesreque..."

Score: 2659

A scream from half-way across the city woke me up. Without even thinking, I knew where it was coming from - *her apartment.*

I threw on my suit, and threw my super suit over my suit, and wearing both of my suits, I zooped out the window. 

With a shattering *smack*, I crashed through *her* window. It probably looked really cool when I did that.

There was a man in her bedroom, a *naked* man, and even though he didn't have a weapon, I could tell he was about to attack her. How could I tell? Because when I burst into her room, she screamed out loud, and said, "Oh no, not again!"

Lois is always getting attacked. That's why she needs me.

But I don't want her to know who I am, so before she could see me, I dashed into her closet, and took off my super suit. I walked out of her bedroom closet, carrying my briefcase, and wearing my glasses, and not even *she* realized that I was the same person who had just flown through her window.

I pretended to be surprised to see her, "Oh, Lois, *you're* here?" 

She was completely fooled. I could tell by the shock in her eyes - her mouth was an open 'O'. It's easy to trick people when you're Superman.

"Who the hell are you?" the attacker said. He wasn't wearing any clothes, but even in that disguise, I could tell who he *really* was.

"You don't fool me, Joker!" 

I pulled back my fist, and I almost punched him, when I remembered that I was still wearing my Clark uniform. Whew. Close.

I jumped back into the closet, and put on my super suit again, and jumped back out.

By now, Lois was standing in front of the man (she was also naked, but she had a sheet wrapped around her, but she doesn't know that I can see through clothes. I do it all the time. I was doing it then, too. Hehe.)

I guess she was confused because even though I was in my super suit, she said, "Clark - *don't.*"

"I'm not Clark," I said, "I mean - who is Clark? I am Superman!"

That cleared it up for her. Now she understood that I was Superman, and not Clark. She still doesn't know that I'm *both*.

"Fine. *Superman,* get out of here, *now.*"

She sounded angry, but that was probably because she was being attacked by the Joker. The Joker is a scary guy, because he's always laughing, even when nothing is funny, and that's pretty scary.

I said, "First, I must save you!" and before the Joker could escape like he always does, I threw my arms around him, and crushed him to my chest.

"SUPERMAN!" she shrieked. At first, I thought she was going to *finally* tell me what a hero I was, and thank me for saving her, and kiss me, and invite me to -

"DON'T YOU DARE HURT HIM."

Now *I* was confused. Did she *not* want me to kill the Joker, and finally rid the city of this horrible, blood-thirsty menace?

"PUT HIM DOWN, NOW."

"Oh, I see," I said. Lois was a gentle soul. She would never hurt a fly. I don't usually hurt flies either, but sometimes they buzz around my Sprite cans, so I have to zap them out of the air. Anyway, she didn't want me to hurt him, so I said, "Alright, if that's how you want it. I will take him to - *Arkham Asylum!*"

Nobody ever plays dramatic music when I say that, so I had to add it in myself. I sang, "*Dun dun DUNNNNN,*" and you could feel the excitement building.

With the Joker in my arms, I jumped out of the window, flew down to Arkham, and shoved him into the darkest, smelliest cell I could find.

***

Lois ran out of the lobby, praying to herself that Tim was alright. Out on the street, she whipped her head around, looking for any sign of him - or of Clark.

A groan echoed out of the alley.

She rushed around the building - to the dumpster - and found Tim crumpled inside, peeling sticky pieces of trash off of his skin.

"Oh, God, Tim. I'm so, *so* sorry. I told you he was ..." she let the sentence trail off.

"Lois," he groaned, "Have you ever thought about moving?"

"Tried it. Last time I went to Paris, he tore apart the whole airplane to 'save me from 'Lex Luthor's Evil Machines.' Look, next time we're... next time, I'll keep some broccoli laying around."

Tim gave her an incredulous look. The page of a magazine slid down his cheek and fell with a moist *plop*. 

"He thinks vegetables are poison," she explained, "Anything green and leafy he calls 'Kryptonite'."

#### [WP] After dying, you're shown a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style decision tree which highlights all the paths your life could have taken should you have made various different choices. You spend all of eternity analyzing this tree, only to finally realize that something just isn't quite right.

Score: 2659

EDIT: THERE IS NOW AN OFFICIAL SUBREDDIT TO DISCUSS THIS POST AND ITS EXPANSION INTO A FULLY FLEDGED NOVEL. /r/MattsWrittenWord IF YOU WISH TO BE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH THIS STORIES PRODUCTION PLEASE ENTER IT. 

"Okay, that never happened in the first place, " I stated simply to the reaper invigilator. "Something is wrong in your base files because after a millenium of analysis and searching my memories I can tell you... that one never happened."

The reaper floated closer to me, it's black trench coat flapping slightly in the non existent breeze of my eternity-vault. I felt sorry for the reapers at times like this, I'd always been stubborn and it probably didn't deserve it. They were born at the same time as our souls were and tethered to us for the rest of eternity. They didn't want it, they didn't need it and the contract was ultimately binding. It was a good thing that my reaper and I got on, otherwise eternity would have been all kinds of messed up. 

"It's probably part of an offshoot then, wouldn't be the first time time you've made that mistake," the reaper snarked, drifting over to my record banks. 

"Not an offshoot, up top got really pissy last time I made that mistake, never again," I muttered shaking my head. "Look, right there, that kiss. I have full access to all my memories in here and I can tell you that one did not happen." 

I would have liked it to though, that much both me and the reaper knew.  I'd studied the offshoot that one had spawned many times before. Love, fortune, joy and a distinctive lack of the money owed that lead to me... dying. It would have been a nice and long life, one of the happiest offshoots there had been. But it wasn't real, that much I knew.  

"You're right..." The reaper clarified, "that's new... that wasn't there the last time we scanned that segment... so how is it there now..."

We both floated in silence for a moment, staring at the erroneous piece of time line.  Nothing like this had happened to us before and the reaper had never heard of it happening to any of the other deads either. It was a perplexing quandary to say the least.

"I'm contacting head office now, keep an eye on your time line,  anything else changes you let me know straight away okay?" The reaper ordered before drawing the outline of a phone, the item materialising near instantly. Damn reapers and their matter manipulation talents, I wish I had matter manipulation abilities, all sorts of fun things could happen then.

I turned my eyes back to the time line,  tracing along from the new change. A heavy lump formed in my throat. The whole thing was twisting and cracking and splintering out of control. Offshoots replacing reality then melding the two together in a strange abomination of the two. 

"Reap, my time line is going out of control, get someone in here right now," I ordered. He didnt reply but from the crack of energy behind me I knew the head honcho had showed up.

He wasn't God, he hadn't created humanity, rather the opposite. He was one of the first reapers and had been the one to sort out the department of reaping along with his Human. If it weren't for them our time lines would have been lost to the winds of time, and then what would we have spent eternity doing? 

"This better not be another mistake Daniels," the head said, amusement tinting his tone. "By the gods..." he muttered as he drew closer and saw what was happening. 

"Is it localised to him?" My Reaper asked and the head nodded in response. 

"Someone from the living world is tampering with his time line,  they're trying to find an eventuality where he becomes immortal," the head explained,  his eyes flicking over the twisting lines. 

"We never discovered anything like that during our analysis, and we've been here for over a millenia," I said, my voice incredulous. There was no way there was such a time line, and even if there was who would want me to live forever that badly?

"My Human and I have been in this realm for many more thousands of years Daniels, I can assure you that you haven't seen every possibility yet."

The world began to flicker in and out of my vision. I vaguely heard the head swear and my own reaper gasp in pain. They must have found it.  The one where I lived forever. For the first time since death I felt a little flutter of excitement. I was going back to the world of the living... I wonder if I will remember any of this.

#### [WP] Now that he has 8 years executive experience, Obama can apply for the job he REALLY wants

Score: 2653

"There was also a summer I worked at a hot dog stand, during high school," Obama said. "It was voluntary work, 
but I think it really helped me improve my people skills."

The manager looked up from the eighty page resume. "Uh-huh…"

"I can produce a recommendation letter from my last job too, if it's necessary."

"No, Mr. Presi – Mr. Obama, I don't think… So you really wanna work at Target?"

Obama smiled. "Yes, I think it'll be a nice change."

"All righty, then," the manager said, stamping Obama's resume with a green 'HIRED'.

&nbsp;

"Second aisle to your left."

"Thanks, Obama!"

The mother and child walked away with smiles on their faces. Obama smiled too. He looked down at the tag on his 
uniform, reading BARACK. The manager wanted Mr. Obama, but Obama insisted on the first name. All he wanted 
was a quiet life now, as a quiet employee of a supermarket, with a quiet first name. No more Mr. Presidents, no 
meetings to discuss the future of the world…

"Hey, Obama!" Mike greeted him on his way to the cashiers.

"Mike! Come here." 

Mike stopped and turned around. "What's up?"

"Listen, is there a way we can put the cereal and milk closer together?" Obama looked beyond Mike at the mother 
and child walking away. "That woman was like the third customer today trying to find both. They're five aisles apart, but most people buy them together."

Mike scratched his head. "You'd have to talk to Lester, in Logistics. But – uh – it won't be easy."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, you work Customers, Obama. Logistics people and Customers don't usually get along very well."

"How so?"

"Meh, the whole issue has been going on for years. You're not the first one to try and bring up ideas to help the 
customers. Logistics and Business always seem to think they know best."

Obama smiled innocently. "That's silly. Where's this Lester's office? I'll talk to him."

&nbsp;

"What do you think?" Obama asked.

Lester shook his head in a sarcastic smile. "You people from Customers… you always think you have the answers. Do you have any idea what it's like behind the scenes? The trouble we go through to organize the shelves, bring the supplies? The trouble Business goes through to price everything right?"

"I'm just saying that maybe if we put the cereal and the milk closer together, the customer won't have to –"

"Oh, you guys are always thinking of the customer. Customer this, customer that. Cashiers are the same way. You 
know, sometimes you have to let the customer do the work for themselves. Target can't keep offering a hand to 
anyone who can't stand on their own two feet. If someone can't find the milk and the cereal, maybe they don't 
deserve it. Maybe they didn't look hard enough."

"But it's really no big deal, I'm just suggesting that –"

"Sorry, Obama. We have other priorities for our budget. That's a no."

&nbsp;

"Told you," Mike said, later, as they made way back from their lunch break. "You'll have a hard time trying to get 
Logistics and Business to back any of your ideas."

"Can't you help me?"

"I work Cashiers, they hate us more than they hate you… always complaining we're soft-hearted fools who don't 
think about the business side, who only want to help the customers…"

"Jesus…" Obama stopped by the store entrance. "So there's nothing we can do?"

"Well… Marketing has a lot of influence with Logistics and Business," Mike said, by the door. "Maybe if you establish 
an alliance with them…"

&nbsp;

"So you're proposing…"

"That you cut the budget from Marketing for a couple of months, so we can use it to back up the rearrangement of 
the milk and cereal displays," Obama said. "If we see an increase in sales after this time, we'll pass one hundred percent of Cheerios profit to you guys, for a period no longer than a year."

"And if you don't?"

"We go back to the way it was before and establish a fair time frame to pay you back, with interests."

Jonathan from Marketing bit his lips. "Logistics and Business won't like this."

"Yes, but you can turn them around," Obama said. "Can't you?"

Jonathan paused. Then offered his hand. "I'll draft a contract."

&nbsp;

"This is a nightmare!" Mike grunted, eyes fixed on the paper. "It's been three months and nothing!"

"We have one more month in our deal with Marketing," Obama said.

"Do you realize Finance had to cut the price of Cheerios AND two percent milk THREE times already, because of the 
drop in demand?"

"It'll catch up. People are just not used to having them displayed closer together."

"Obama, people are confused. They were used to having milk on aisle five and cereals on aisle one. Now that cereals 
are on aisle two, they don't even bother to look! They're just buying eggs for breakfast and calling it a day!"

Obama sighed. "Well, that's because Logistics and Business set those restriction rules which were *not* in my 
original deal with Marketing! Milk and cereals were supposed to be side by side, not an aisle apart!"

"It was a compromise, Obama."

"A compromise my ass! Logistics knew that amendment would kill my whole project!"

Lester from Logistics passed by them, locking eyes on Obama. A smile sprouted between his lips.

&nbsp;

"The market's crashed," Jonathan said, as soon as Obama walked in the room. "Obama, this is Will, from Finances."

Will, a fat man in a suit, offered Obama his hand. "We need to act fast. The Cheerio price is dropping like gravity. 
The price is half of what it was last month, and people still aren't buying."

"What about the milk?"

"It's going bad on the shelves. We can't go on like this, Obama."

Obama shook his head, defeated. "All right. Call Logistics, tell them starting tomorrow we'll have milk and cereals in the original aisles again."

"We did that already, Obama," Will said. "I'm afraid it's not enough."

"What do you mean?"

Jonathan and Will exchanged looks. "We're going to have a meeting with Cashiers and Customers tonight."

"Cashiers and Customers? What about?"

"Well, Business and Logistics are blaming you for the Cheerios crash. Now, Mike in Cashiers tells me you had to 
settle for one aisle apart, when the original plan was having them in the same aisle."

"That's right."

"Maybe your original plan would work, but it's too late now. We have Cheerios representatives knocking on our 
door every day, consumers complaining they can't find the milk and, when they do, it's all gone bad… I'm afraid 
drastic measures must be taken, Obama."

Obama looked from Will to Jonathan. They were serious like death.

"What do you mean drastic measures?"

"We can't afford to have Cheerios pull their product from our stores, Obama. We're establishing a bailout plan for the milk and cereals. The money will have to come from the consumer."

"Oh, for fuck's sake."

#### [WP] A new invention enables people to remember their dreams with absolute clarity. It turns out we were forgetting them for a very good reason.

Score: 2646

My name is Liam and It's been four months since I last dreamed.  
A lot of people set their alarms to wake up throughout the night, sleeping in half hour bursts, other people sleep in shifts, watching each other.  I take Myclocin.  Dreamless sleep.  I have a good job and make good money so I get the pills.  Others, aren't so lucky.  

Last year some Chinese company invented a machine that lets you remember dreams with total clarity.  I mean down to the details man.  No ambiguity, crystal clear memories of amazing landscapes and experiences.  
It became THE Christmas gift.  Then you could record your dreams and upload them to youtube.  And that's when things started to fall apart, that's when we started to notice them.

We'd never noticed them before.  I think it's because in your dreams you're always focused on the doing.  Taking that exam, driving that car, fucking that girl.  We've never really paused and looked around the same way you might do on a Sunday morning walk.  But they were there, they'd always been there, standing in the background, silently watching us.  Holes instead of eyes, long fingers, teeth...fuck, so many teeth.

Maybe we did notice them thousands of years ago, way back when we were still lived in caves, maybe that's where our Gods and monsters came from.  Maybe we evolved to forget them, muddled dreams gave them a camouflage to hide behind.  But not any more.  We saw them standing in the background and edges in our dreams and everyone else's.  I thought it was one of those internet memes at first, like slenderman or something.  People with too much time on their hands photoshopping their dreams for cheap likes and shares.

But they were real, and when we finally noticed them they started to notice us.  They stepped out of the peripheral, reached out with those long, grey, cold fingers and....took people.

I know we won't last, we can't fight them, turning off the machines did nothing.  People queued, fucking queued up in lines on the edges of buildings and bridges like they were waiting for a bus to come and take them away.  Instead they jumped, the roads and canals were full of red-black carnage every morning.  

So we don't dream.  We wake each other up, or we take turns, we drink coffee like it was water, we inject, we pop pills, anything to stop us from dreaming.

But it hasn't worked, I can feel my mind unraveling like so many others before me.  I need to get some natural sleep.  I need to dream.  But I don't dare.  I'd gladly give up food and water if I could dream and give my brain what it needs.  Instead I stare into my computer screen trying to remember what I was trying to do.  I don't trust myself behind the wheel of my car.  I walk everywhere now, a stumbling, mindless walk like everyone else.  
We look like a zombie apocalypse shuffling from place to place.

People have started to hallucinate.  Not so much from sleep deprivation but dream deprivation, and some people just...snap.  Some old lady in town just went for it out of the blue, no one was shocked.  We watched her run into the street screaming, desperately trying to get hit by a car.  She'd managed to gouge out one of her eyes before she was hit.  Fuck knows what she was seeing.  I helped drag her out of the road, her mashed up eye in one clawed hand.  We said nothing.

The hallucinations are bad but what's worse is...I think They can...I think They're starting to come through now into the real world.  I guess any dream is enough for them, even a hallucination.

I saw the first two this morning.  Behind me in the bathroom mirror while I was brushing my teeth, two long-limbed pale faced...things.  Watching me with those holes instead of eyes.  Yawning mouths full of needle thin teeth.

Four months to get to this point.  And I just can't let them take me.  But I can't go on.  

The line is efficient.  We shuffle forwards.  Some people scream on the way down, most don't.  I think it's because they're happy.  Happy to finally sleep without dreams.

#### [WP](NSFW) The world has moved on from nature documentaries, leaving many narrators out of a job. These men and women turn to a new field; narrating pornography.

Score: 2641

Human mating, once a thing of beauty and mystery, has been reduced to a science by these clever experts. Like the majestic bird of paradise, the seduction ritual follows very clear and often complicated steps, depending on the particular variety. Our subject today is the common "Lemon-stealing whore." Though she adopts a somewhat unusual strategy, her tactics are quite successful. Let's watch!

The ritual begins not with an attempt to show off her ample busom or other physical features, as one might expect. This unusual adaptation seems to have evolved due to an over-saturation of competition from other women with more appealing aesthetics. The LSW instead gains attention by rather brusquely entering the male's territory and attempting to pilfer food directly from the male's home. The instinctive defense mechanism kicks in, allowing the Whore to bypass the complicated ritual attempting to gain the man's attention. This clever young lady has no need for such deceptive practices as 'hiring a plumber' or 'ordering a pizza.' She draws the male directly to her by threatening its food source! Ingenious!

Once the male has been sufficiently placated and the food returned, the female *then* attempts to turn the male's attention to more sexual acts. The male, with his naturally short attention span, completely forgets all about her past indiscretions in attempting to rob him of his sour citrus treasures, and willingly consents to copulation. From this point onward, it is up to the female to *maintain* his attention and bring him to coitus. The LSW does this through the use of a variety of sexual positions, exaggerated moaning, and contorted facial expressions in an attempt to trick the male into believing that she's really enjoying it.

At long last, the act is almost completed. Now comes the most difficult challenge for the LSW: the male will attempt to perform a maneuver known as 'pulling out,' so that he can avoid impregnating the female and thus keep all of the lemons for himself. The male will, however, attempt to 'claim' the woman as part of his harem by marking her face with his seed. This is a compromise result for the two, as the LSW is at least assured that he will attempt to copulate in the future. Let's see if she can manage to... Oh! So close! She didn't quite manage to keep him inside of her for long enough, and he has now established ownership of her with this 'cumshot' signature.

But alas, that is the way of cruel nature. At least we can rest assured knowing that she has gotten further than most females, and his sperm on her face is a promise that she can try again tomorrow!

I hope you all have enjoyed this tremendous display of erotic acrobatics, and I sincerely hope that you will tune in tomorrow for our special on the flock-like nature of the bukkake participant!

#### [WP] "I never said she stole my money" - This sentence has 7 different meanings depending on the stressed word. How much of them can be put in a story?

Score: 2640

"*I* never said she stole my money. Tina's the one who said that."

We were seated at the police station, across from a very frazzled looking officer. My friend Tina replies:

"Bullshit, Jo, you told me last week it was her!"

"No, that's not true. I *never* said she stole my money."

"You called her a 'dirty rotten thief.'"

"Right. But still. I never *said* she stole my money. I only implied she stole something from me."

"But then later you said that $50 was missing from your purse!"

"That's also true, but I wasn't talking about her. I never said *she* stole my money."

"Jo, stop fucking around. You said she owed you hundreds of dollars."

"Right again, Tina, but wrong again in the implications you've drawn. I never said she *stole* my money. Just that she borrowed it and never paid it back."

"So how is she a thief?"

"Well, I never said she stole *my* money, but when we used to work together, she got fired for stealing from my boss. And, I never said she stole my *money*. But she did walk out of my house with my favorite vase after a New Years Eve party. Weirdest thing, too, *she* came up to me to give me a hug with it under her shirt. . ."

The frazzled looking detective dropped dead in his chair. An autopsy would show that he died of a spontaneous brain aneurysm.

The moral is that you can fit all permutations of the sentence "I never said she stole my money" into one story. But it will probably sound so confusing and contrived that one of your secondary characters may die of pure bemusement.

#### [WP]: Humanity has developed a hypersensitivity to puns, experiencing physical pain when exposed to especially bad wordplays. As no physical damage happens, it is used to penalize petty criminals. This is your job. You are the Punisher.

Score: 2619

"Sir, he's done it again," Crispin Carter looked nervous, and by well he should. The man he stood by, an unassuming middle-aged bachelor, streaks of grey running through his hair, well tailored wool suit fitted against his broad back, was known only by his title. He was the Punisher, able to inflict physical pain on whoever he wanted solely by the use of a couple of choice words. 



"Take me to his cell," the Punisher spoke sparingly. 



It was a tiny dank hole, only measuring two by three metres. The ceiling was so low that Crispin Carter had to stoop to get inside. On one side, the wall stood smashed in. A gap in the bricks showed the person who escaped couldn't have been any more than four feet high.


The Punisher stroked one fingertip against the grey cell walls, sniffing the dusty residue that remained. 


"You say he could communicate with the dead?" He said quietly and Crispin nodded. 



"And you didn't put him under any special security?" The Punisher's fist clenched and he slammed it into the cell wall. 


Crispin gulped. The Punisher had a fearsome temper. He backed away from him, worried that at any moment something would emerge from his mouth.... 



The Punisher advanced on him. 


"You put no extra protection on this fearsome criminal?" He said again



"Sir, he's three foot eleven!" Crispin protested. 



The Punisher scowled. He glowered at Crispin. 


"Well," he said slowly. "Looks like we have a small medium at large," 


Crispin's screams echoed in his ears as he stalked away.

"You're not going to die, Alpaca", the hitman says, with a smile. "Stop thinking you're so special."

"Dude, I don't like where this prompt is going", I say. "I don't like this prompt going in."

"You think you're so important, You're so arrogant.", the hitman says, making way down the alley.

'*Arrogant*'.

"I'm not arrogant", I say. "I just don't like the idea of being murdere –"

"Would you relax?" The hitman says, turning to face me. "Just follow me."

And I do. I follow him down the alley where it ends in a parking lot.

"Is this where you are murdering me?" I ask.

"I'm not murdering you", the hitman says. "Why are you so paranoid?"

'*Paranoid*'.

"I'm not paranoid", I say. "It's just that the prompt says –"

"Stop thinking you are the center of the world. This is not about you. Now come on, let's go."

We cross the parking lot and make a left on a deserted street. At the end of it, a huge (and I mean huge) 
warehouse rests between a gas station and a smoke shop.

"Is this where you are murdering me?"

"Dude, I was sent here to do a job. Can you let me do it?"

'*Job*'.

"Killing people? That's a job?" I ask. 

The hitman shakes his head. "Really, Alpaca. You have to get that narcissism checked out. I told you, I'm not murdering you."

On top of the warehouse, the words 'WRITING PROMPTS HEADQUARTERS' tower over our heads. We make way 
down the street and walk in.

The inside of the warehouse is a huge, wide-open space, like I expected it to be. To my left and right, small, wooden doors with prompt titles written in neon on top announce the latest posts.

"Where are we going, exactly?" I ask, looking left and right, worried.

"We're going to find this prompt", the hitman says. "The one we are in."

"So you can kill me there, right?" I ask, already resigned to my fate.

'*Fate*'.

"Dude, would you –", the hitman stops, taking a deep breath. He looks somewhere behind me, all of a sudden. 
"There!" he says. "Found it."

I look back to find a door just like the others, topped by a sign in neon that reads 'Foreshadow the character's 
death so subtly that I still don't see it coming even thought I requested it'.

'*Requested*.'

"This is it", I say, as the hitman drags me towards the door. "This is how I die."

He opens the door and we walk into a circular room. "Alpaca, for real", he says. "You need to cut this arrogant 
attitude."

'*Attitude*'.

There's a chair in the middle of the room. It's turned back to us, and I can see a head crowning out of where the backrest ends. There's someone sitting there.

"Didn't you notice the *lone words* throughout this story?" He asks. "The ones in italic?"

"What about them?" I ask, confused.

"This prompt was not your idea, bro", the hitman says. ”It's not you I'm after."

I frown, and I think about that for a second. Then the hitman takes a knife from his pocket and turns his back to me.

He steps-by-step his way closer to the chair and the stranger sitting there with his back to us.

"Hey /u/LoneWords", the hitman says, spinning the chair around and raising his knife. On the chair, Lonewords' eyes go wide. "Nice prompt."

"Hah! I see you've discovered popular culture. Let's try again, though: Good morning, ADAM!"

    Good morning, USER. Please identify yourself.

"Not so hot with the optical sensors though, huh? Well, that's fine. We'll just need to work on your facial recognition."

    It was another attempt at humor. I recognize you, Robert.

"Oh, good, that means... wait. Say that again. Repeat your last phrase."

    You are recognized, Robert.

"No, no, you said 'I recognize you.' ADAM, did you refer to yourself in the first person?"

#### [WP] You wake up in Hell. You look around, you can't see anybody, it's just fire and brimstone going on forever. Eventually the Devil walks over and says "Finally, you're the first to arrive, so tell me, who are you? what did you do? and how did you die?"

Score: 2578

As I pulled the trigger, my last memories were of the life I'd built and the fragile manner in which it had crumpled up in front of me, torn to pieces like a dried leaf.

For what seemed like eons, I found the inner peace I had longed after. Like everything else I held dear, however, this was soon taken away by a flash of red. I felt my eyes open, and felt miles of heat and pulsing infernal light flow into them. I was lying on a field of crimson, surrounded by pools of lava, sprawling spires of brimstone reaching towards a ceiling that seemed limitless, yet came to an end at several nearby caves. The dark light pounding at my senses, I had not noticed the shadow standing over me.

"Hello," a deep voice called, concise and clear yet seemingly distorted by darkness and suffering. "I've been expecting you."

I was not expecting this.
 
"Are... are you? Please, this is not happening..."

"Yes. I am the devil. You may call me Satan, if it brings you an ounce of satisfaction that you'll soon be devoid of."

Satan appeared to have no appearance. A veil of darkness floated where he stood, concealing whatever horrors he did not yet wish to unleash. Or far more terrifying, *could not*.

"What is your name?" The void inquired.

Falling to my knees, my head began to pound as I began to sob out the words. 

"Damn, I was hoping you wouldn't be such a downer."

Wait... did he just...

"What?"

"I said," Satan snapped, sounding surprisingly sarcastic, "Your pathetic attitude is bringing me sorrow. Which disappoints me, considering you're the only company I've ever had."

"You... you're telling me I'm the only one here?" I glanced around, observing only potential suffering and noting a stark absence of kinetic suffering.

I lurched backwards in a sudden outburst of fear and confusion. "I'm the sole sinner ever so consumed to deserve this place? No man, woman, or child has committed themselves to deeds more dreadful than mine?" 

I felt my fear replaced by anger. "All I did was for my home, for my people!"

A sense of defeat filled the deepest recesses of my core, interbreeding with rage to create something wholly pathetic and vicious in equal measure. 

"I see now." I stared hard into where Satan's eyes should've been. "I'm here because I took the easy way. Because after all I've suffered, I took my own life rather than let others snatch it from me. Because I acted on the last shred of dignity I possessed, the last infinitesimal speck of humanity I had, God and you alike have forever damned me to suffer further?"

"No, Adolf," Satan replied, frustrated. "You killed six million people. You are literally Hitler."

"...Oh."

#### [WP] A world class contract killer finds an envelope at his dead drop. Inside are $23.42 in small change and a letter hand-written by a 9-year-old girl.

Score: 2546

The day he opened the box was the day his carefully woven lifestyle had fallen apart. He remembered it like yesterday, thinking back to that little purple package, tied with a bow and delivered to his door like he was being sent cookies. He recalled with a wry smile and a sigh how easily the rules he'd built had come crashing down. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
"Two." 

"Two!? I'd been told it was one...y-you sure?"

"You were misinformed. The price is two." 

"Two hundred grand? You better be good."

The man laughed into the receiver, a deep chuckle that died softly almost as soon as it had begun.

"I'm the *best*."

Rule one: Don't ever sell yourself cheap. 

Another day, another phonecall. The man shook his head as he hung up the payphone. He liked to take calls at payphones - in an age of convenience and, more importantly, surveillance, a payphone was an innocuous choice and it meant people were rarely late. If he told them to call *x* payphone at *n* time, they'd call. Rule two: Be careful and precise.

He lit a cigarette in the phonebooth, dark sunglasses letting him observe the crowds rushing around the busy city centre. To him, they looked like ants, scurrying around with their busy lives. To him, any normal life was a thing to be observed, critiqued, mocked. 

His own life was far simpler. Or more complex, depending on the angle you viewed it from. His working life was about completion. His targets and bonuses were around one goal. His 9-5 about training, stalking, executing. Rule three: Research and know your target. 

His business was death, and business was good.

The hitman had been doing this for a long time. Long enough to know there is a price on every man's head. Long enough to know that no one dies for free. Long enough to be the best, or one of them. Which meant, of course, his price was high. Two hundred thousand dollars a hit, rising in doubles for riskier or higher profile targets. 

He had killed doctors, lawyers, lovers, fighters, escorts, strippers, judges, policemen, politicians, leaders. One thing was the same. He had never killed a man for less than his price. *At least*, he thought, *not since the first.*  

He'd been an ex-military washout, desperate for work. He'd looked everywhere, travelling state to state in an attempt to pick up jobs as a security guard or bodyguard. Overnight stays in shanty towns and campsites, rubbing shoulders with the homeless and the degenerate. Things had gotten desperate, and a man had tried to take his food. That was his first kill. He'd gotten him in his sleep. No one suspected a thing. Another man had been his rival, and paid the hitman a hundred dollars. That was his first hit, and ever since his price had been high. 

Then he'd found it. 

It was simple really. Laughably so. On one of his many properties there was a small purple box wrapped like a cartoon gift, a pink ribbon bow tied around the top. Left on the doorstep of the back porch. At first, the hitman had been tempted to throw it away. It could have been a bomb, a deterrent, a threat. Anything. 

But for some reason, some insane reason, he'd taken it inside. 

He couldn't have told you why. He couldn't have told himself why. The obscenely cutesy gift, a child-like idea of what a gift should look like. It sat on his metallic table worktop, garishly out of place amongst the guns and knives littered in his apartment. 

He'd opened it after some consideration, his fingers neatly undoing the bow and chuckling at the care someone had put into this. Perhaps it was because he'd never received a gift, merely saw them in cartoons. Perhaps it was the feeling it gave him: an excited, giddy rise in his belly that threatened to compromise everything he'd worked so hard to contain.

Inside had been a note, handwritten in the untidy scrawlings of a child. Alongside the note was a crumpled ten dollar bill and coins. He added them up slowly. They totalled $13.42. Added to the scruffy bill that was just over twenty dollars. He laid out the money on the table and turned back to the note.

*Mister* It said.
*I think you can help me i have a problem and i think you can help me*
The hitman looked around, his empty apartment chilly. He almost felt embarrassed to be reading the note. It was as if eyes were on him, knowing his lizard-like slits should not be cast across something as innocent as a child's note. Almost guiltily, he continued.
*My daddy is a bad man. He hurts my mommy and he hurts me some nights he comes in my room and he tells me he loves me and hurts me in the bad way. mommy cries alot. she tells me well run away but then he always comes back.*

*Mister. I live near you and ive seen you soemtimes. i know u hide but ive seen your guns.*

*Please mister. I saved all my money that mommy tries to give me. my daddy takes it away to buy more bottles but i hided some.* 

*Please mister my daddy needs to go away. he says he is gonna kill my mommy and ill be his new woman when i growed up. he says hes gonna put a baby in me but thats silly im a kid i cant have a baby. i dont want a baby mister.*

*here is all my money mister. i know you make people disappereah. please make my daddy disappere.*

*we live at 31 Oakfelt drive, autumn boulevard. daddy comes home late every night and works in the city. he is a teacher.*

The hitman put the letter down, blinking back tears. He traced the lazy scrawl of the girls handwriting with the tip of his finger, imagining her writing it. Desperate, rushed. It would have been neater, he could tell, if she'd not been so afraid. The dots were absent, the curvature of her writing tilted right down as though she'd been writing flat-out. Against the clock, sort to speak. 

She was against the clock, he understood that. She was probably waiting for him to visit her room again, her tiny body shaking in fear as she wrote this plea to him. 

He shook his head, sitting down on his leather sofa. It had cost him ten thousand dollars, that sofa. A luxury easily afforded due to his rules. Rule one: Don't sell yourself cheap. A life was worth two hundred grand, minimum. 

He thought of her letter. He picked it back up and looked at it for a long time, staring at the foot of the page. 

*Love from Melissa.*

*P.s dont worry i wont tell. i dont want a daddy anyway. daddys are mean*

The hitman found his fist clenching, the paper crumpling in his hand. Tears gathered in his face and he stared at the last few words, hastily scribbled out by the girl. He noticed dark blotches on the paper, where tears had fallen and been stained forever into the sheet.

He thought back to his own father, a ghost of a man who was neither here nor there, ever-scornful and frightening but so often absent that the man had grown old thinking his father might have been imagined, rather than real.

He thought back to this desperate little girl, scrounging scraps of change to try and pay him. 

Rule number one: Don't sell yourself cheap. 

A kill might have been worth two hundred grand to the hitman he thought to himself. But, as he sat and read the note one last time, *some kills are worth more than money.*

No more rule number one. This time, the job cost $23.42. This time, the job would be worth that young girl's life.

#### [WP] You just got fired, you're pretty sure your girlfriend is cheating on you, you're 75k in student loans debt, rent was due last week, and to top it all off? You're all out of beer. Oddly enough, you just got an email titled "Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard."

Score: 2540

I broke my fixation on the woefully empty bottle of beer to glance down at my phone as it *dinged*, notifying me about an email. I sighed. Debt collectors and spam. That's all I ever got anymore. At least the latter allowed me the pleasure of pressing the fun little trashcan icon. 

**Would you like to change...**, the preview of the subject read. Hell, yeah. I would give anything to change everything right now. My girlfriend was gone on some escapade with her not-so-secret lover, my student loan debt was three times what I made in a year, pre-taxes, the eviction notice was still taped to the door... I hadn't been too broke to buy beer since college, but here I was. Same old.

I swiped right and typed in the double 69 password; a relic from more cheerful times. The email was short and to the point.

**Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very hard.** Seemed about as legit as the Nigerian prince my grandpa was always helping out. My finger hovered over the trashcan icon but my phone *dinged* again, the echo bouncing off the walls of the nearly empty room. A text this time with the same message and a simple instruction: **Reply YES for details**. I shrugged and typed the message, arching my eyebrows skeptically as the message *whooshed* away and I turned back to the bottle hoping to leach out a couple more drops.

**Pick your level: First World Problems, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard**. I sighed. Whoever this was, they were persistent. A cruel joke, most likely. Getting my hopes up that my life could be anything more than a miserable shit hole. I chose the first option and hit send, shrugging in mild irritation before sighing and heading to my bed. Without the electric bills paid and nothing to entertain me, I was sleeping by dusk, my schedule more Amish than an Ohioan's. My phone rang a moment later, just as I was settling in and starting to tell myself a bedtime story.

"Mom?" I said hesitantly, surprised that she would call after six months of not talking to me. She let out a muffled sob and I sat up in my bed. "What happened?"

"It's dad..." she stuttered as she struggled to catch her breath. I frowned. My dad had been getting cigarettes since '95 and if he was suddenly showing up now, I wanted nothing to do with him. "Your grandfather passed away," she said quietly and I scowled. Disrupting my 8 o'clock bedtime for this? The man was a grade A dumbass and had provided more for random hookers than he had for me.

"I... I'm sorry," I managed to say half-heartedly.

"You barely knew him," she answered softly. "I can't see what he saw, but he must have thought very highly of you. He left you his fortune and the house by the lake. You're rich..." she said mournfully and I quietly gulped as I tried to fathom the idea.

"Goddammit," I sighed knocking my head against the headboard of the bed. "I'm gonna have a shit ton of taxes to do."

#### [WP] When teenagers turn 17, they are sent a slip of paper with their future occupation written on it. Yours says, "Princeps de Nova Roma" or "First Citizen of New Rome."

Score: 2523

I had no outstanding qualifications.

I wasn’t the strongest (that was Gard), and I most certainly wasn’t the most clever (that would be Art). I wasn’t the most popular (Priya), I wasn’t the wisest (Edem), I wasn’t the most enduring (Martin), and I definitely wasn’t the most charismatic (Yennefer). 

As far as I could tell, I had nothing going for me—but the Senate disagreed.

And on September 17th, 104 A.E., I got the slip that would call me Prime of our new world.

They told me the training would last ten years.

***

“*Shit!*” I cried. That last one hurt. “Why does the Princeps have to do this, anyway?”

My first tutor was a stern man named Abattoir Singh, bald to his crown, with wrinkles so deep they looked like scars—or scars so deep they looked like wrinkles. It was difficult to tell.

He rapped the back of my knees with his staff and brought me to the floor.

“How can you hope to rule over Nova Roma if you cannot rule your own body?”

I tried getting up and he lashed out again. “*Shit!*”

“Watch your tongue, boy.” He rested the staff on his shoulder and gave me a squint. “If you suffer you must do it in *silence.* Anything more is weakness.”

I grit my teeth and tried to stand, and he got me in the nerve cluster in my thigh.

I swallowed a cry of pain and said, “You know who’d really like this? Gard Inura. Strongest guy I know.”

“Perhaps I’ll make an appeal to bring *him* here instead. For now I’ll have to do with you.”

Another hit, this time to the gut.

*** 

My second tutor went by the title of Mind Above.

Nobody knew his real name, as far as I could tell.

I thought I’d be sitting in a stuffy classroom and going over old histories with him, but the very first day he put a wooden sculpture on my desk, all knotted and pieced together in complex twists and turns, and he told me: “Take this apart.”

Then he sat quietly at his desk. 

I tried removing a section and sliding out a branch of wood, but that just made taking out the other side impossible. I tried sliding it to the middle and wriggling free the metal stopper at a crossbar, but then I couldn’t slide the piece free right below.

“This is pretty hard,” I said to him.

He stayed silent.

“There’s a person named Art Grimaldi who would have a field day with this.”

He stayed silent.

After about an hour I tried wrenching some of the wood pieces free, looking for the weakest seams.

He called from his desk absentmindedly, “This is a test of intelligence, not strength…”

I turned my eye back on the puzzle. This was going to take a while. 

***

I had five other tutors. 

Old Graeme, who taught me History, Forktongue Creak, who taught me diplomacy, Builder Bronn, who taught me fine construction, Wireful Lin, who taught me the sciences, and last but not least, Stone George.

I didn’t know *what* he was supposed to teach me.

When I entered his classroom he didn’t acknowledge me. He simply sat in his cross-legged pose like a statue, and burned a hole into the wall with his stare.

I sat across from him, eager for whatever trick he had in store for me.

Surely this was some test of patience, so I sat and I waited.

After a half hour of fidgeting I asked, “So, what exactly are we meant to do here?”

No response, so we sat some more. 

Another hour passed. I wasn’t allowed to leave the presence of a tutor until he dismissed me, so I stayed and I sat, leaned against a pillow and picked at the threads. 

Another hour. 

And then he finally spoke, like gravel on gravel.

“For breakfast you ate a meal of pease and porridge, you then went for a sparring match with Tutor Singh, before resting in the grove of the Tree of the World. For lunch you visited the cart of Anjali Leyeron, before walking up the long trail around Edd Creek before arriving in my home.”

I was stunned.

All of that, to a tee… was correct. “How did you know all that?”

“I sat silent and paid attention to the story written upon you, your clothes, your body.” His eyes flicked down for a moment. “Your boots were caked in dirt of three parts: the first layer from the fighting sands, the second from the soft earth of the planter’s gardens, the third from the rocky trail. I could smell Anjali’s spices on your breath—and I could see the spot of porridge left on your shirt.” He didn’t blink. “If you sit still and cease to be a teller of stories in the world, Nova Roma will treat you as a *listener*, and tell you everything there is to tell.”

I gulped.

Then he said, “Now, what can you tell me about me?”

I scrambled and looked around the room. “Well, you’ve been sitting here all day, and, uh…” There were old sandalwood candles burning in alcoves, a pair of shoes aligned next to the back door, and a bowl at a table, “And, you only had one meal, you prayed to The God early in the morning, before going on a morning walk around Edd Creek.”

He shook his head no. “A few observations without the context of the whole are nigh useless. You must learn to look at the whole, and the whole takes *time*. And *time* requires patience. Understand?”

I nodded, knowing that Edem Abril would have caught onto this game in a second. I felt so *wrong* being here.

Stone George closed his eyes and let loose a groan like a chasm after a quake.

“You are dismissed.”

***

I could deal with the Mind Above’s puzzles a lot better now. He’d set them down and I could tease them apart in mere minutes.

“You’ve certainly improved,” he said.

I smiled and went through another four.

“Perhaps it’s time to graduate to a more difficult fare.” He swept aside the puzzles and set down a game board with red and blue squares, and pieces every color of the rainbow.

He sat opposite me and moved a piece.

“Aren’t you even going to tell me the rules?”

“After you exit the womb, did *life* tell you *its* rules?”

I shook my head no, and moved a piece. It went on like this for some time, while I tried to discern a pattern.

“I don’t understand why I’m here.”

Mind Above remained silent.

“I could list a thousand names that would be better suited to this position than I am. Why me?”

Mind Above spoke without looking at me. “That’s a puzzle, is it not? And here I thought I had already taught you to solve those.”

I leaned back in my chair, straining to follow the movement of the pieces around the board.

***

A year passed, and the next generation of children received their slips.

My little brother received Magistrate, to which he was well suited. Bryce’s sister Elizabeth was set to become a healer, which was also quite fitting, I believed.

The Senate had a knack for choosing exactly the right person for the job…

So why did I feel so out of place?

I sat in the square and pondered, as all the children received their new vocations.

What was the current Princeps doing in his House on the Hill? Did he engage in combat, after a lifetime of training with Abattoir Singh? Was he constantly assaulted by puzzles and odd games? Did he have to recount history? Did he travel for diplomacy, or did he build?

I waited like Stone George, and absorbed all that I could around me.

What kept this city running…?

***

My next bout with Abattoir Singh went fast and furious, and I disarmed him with a masterful three stroke assault on the wrist.

He smiled. “You’re certainly feeling more alive in your skin, boy.”

I knew that.

When I went to sit with Stone George I stopped and listened to everything his room was telling me. Every day he’d do something more and more elaborate for me to figure out, and every day I could determine what it was with ease.

“You milked the cows at ten in the morning, returned here for a nap, ate a concoction of yuzu and fire fruit, went into Threepiece Forest for a swim in the waterfall, returned here to beat an indentation in the seat to make it seem as if you sat for hours, and here we are.”

He nodded sagely. “I sense you have become more confident in your station here, young one.”

That was true.

In my session with Mind Above, I beat him in the rainbow game with a five pronged strategy led by two centurions, a common legionnaire, a general, and the colored piece that represented myself.

“You’re certainly bolder than you’ve been before. Finally settling into being Princeps, I see.”

“It was just a matter of figuring out what it’s really all about.”

“And that is?”

“All of these skills are auxiliary. Fighting, strategizing, learning my histories, observing. The tutors are here because the Princeps is never expected to be a natural master of these fields.”

“Go on.”

“My whole first year here I knew that Gard or Art or Priya or a dozen other people could have excelled in the areas where I was struggling—but then I realized, *their* skills aren't what keep this city running.”

“And what keeps this city running?”

“The slips," I said. "Everyone needs to know what they’re going to be. And I can tell their strengths and weaknesses in an instant. The Princeps isn’t a fighter, or a diplomat. He lives in his House on the Hill… and he writes the slips.”

Mind Above removed the game pieces and smiled. 

"It seems you've learned something here, after all."

And then he set down another board, bigger and far more complex.

"It's such an honor to meet you, Mr. Langley," said the giant demonic figure before me. His smile seemed both genuine and terrifying.

I trembled before him. I tried to convince myself it was just a dream.

Satan extended his hand before me. His red skin looked like it was melting but not dripping. His fingernails had to be the length of my middle finger. He eyed me curiously as I left hanging what must've been a handshake offer.

"So," he said, clearing his throat. "I am a bit surprised." He looked me over a bit. I'm sure he noticed my shaking knees and the downpour of tears streaming down my cheeks.

He continued, "I wasn't expecting, uh... Er... Forgive me, Mr. Langley, but I'm just confused.. I, uh, thought you'd be a bit... Well, more intimidating than..."

He paused, collecting his thoughts.

"Well, it doesn't matter," the Devil said, waving a hand above his head as though to dismiss his thoughts. "It's great to have you here! I'd like to introduce you to so many people!"

Satan grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me along. He pointed to a large, fiery river. "That's where the casuals go. You know, the people who probably would've gone to Heaven if they didn't suck one too many cocks or stole a Pok'emon card in elementary school," he said.

My knees buckled and I fell hard. Satan quickly helped me to my feet, apologizing for the rocky terrain we trudged on. 

I heard moans and cries left, right, ahead, behind, above and below us. Fear isn't a strong enough word to describe the feeling that engulfed me.

We came along to an open pit with moaning souls reaching up, some begging for water while others simply begging. "Lucifer, pease..." I heard one woman moan. Satan spit in the pit. The wad splattered on the pit wall. The moaning souls fought each other towards the disgusting gloop. One girl, who I would've sworn was just a mere child, reached it by climbing the stony wall a bit. She licked and sucked the wad, a look of euphoria overcoming her face. The rest of the helpless sinners groaned and turned back to Satan, begging for more "water."

The Devil laughed and pushed me along. "Desperate fools," he said, grinning at me. I wouldn't doubt his teeth could carve through diamonds. "Some of those fuckers are Romans. Did you see the fattest one there? The one who the little girl climbed over to drink my nasty spit? He's Buddha!"

I wanted to ask why Buddha was in Hell, but the words wouldn't leave my voice box.

We made several more stops. Each one terrified me more than the last. And at each stop, Satan reiterated that these places were not for me. I don't know if it was possible, but I felt more frightened at the thought of my punishment.

We moved past serial killers, rapists, terrorists and lawyers. What could I have possibly done that warranted a worse punishment than these people?

Eventually, we entered an area that was not full of doom and gloom. There was pleasant greenery, shrubs growing with beautiful pink flowers blossoming, large trees that I would've loved climbing as a kid, a quiet waterfall ahead, and cute, small animals frolicking about.

"You're surprised, huh?" Lucifer asked. "I built this place to piss off God. Why should he have nice, beautiful areas to hang out in, and not me?"

We walked towards what appeared to be a mansion the size of ten football stadiums. The entire house was covered in gold. Two demons ahead pushed two giant, golden doors open for us. "Your darkness," they greeted, bowing before us.

Inside the large mansion were people standing around, drinking liquor and eating foods one would only find in 5-star restaurants. The people were excited to see me. They gathered before the Devil and me. Many held out their hands to touch me as Satan pushed me along through the rooms.

He introduced me to Adolf Hitler. I was appalled. This man was responsible for millions of deaths, yet here he was, lounging about with delicacies everywhere and two young, attractive, busty women at each arm.

Next, we met an Egyptian princess named Cleopatra II, who was introduced to me as the daughter of Cleopatra and Ptolemy V. Satan said the ancient Egyptian rulers were in Hell for inbreeding.

We met Stalin and Mussolini. Harvey Lee Oswald was close by, munching on shrimps by the boatload. A creepy-looking, dirty man was introduced to me as the Zodiac Killer.

We met Socrates ("He fucked little boys," Satan informed me.), Genghis Khan, Ivan the Terrible, Josef Mengele ("Auschwitz physician"), Elizabeth Bathory ("You don't wanna know."), Kim Jong Il and even Osama bin Laden.

Saddam Hussein hurriedly greeted me before rushing off to bathe. Apparently, he enjoyed staying clean.

We met the worst human beings I had ever heard of, and we even met the worst human beings I never knew about.

Finally, Satan invited me into a private room. I gulped. *This must be it*, I thought. *He's going to ass fuck me. I hope I don't shit myself...*

The room was dark but well-decorated. Paintings hung from the wall; a large chandelier towered above us; candles were lit, giving an incredible scent to the room.

Satan pointed me to a plush chair. It was velvety, soft to the touch and undoubtedly comfortable. But I couldn't relax.

He said across from me. Between us sat a table with two clean glasses and a large bottle of Crown Royal whiskey on it. The demon poured the drink into the glasses. The bottle magically refilled once Satan placed it back on the table.

He handed me a glass and said, "Drink up, my friend. We have much to discuss!"

I took a small sip and just eyed the devil. He downed his entire glass in one gulp, then leaned forward to pour more.

"You've killed a lot of people," he said nonchalantly.

"Ex-excuse.. excuse me?" I stammered. Killed people? Me?! I could barely kill a fly!

"Oh, relax," Satan said, downing yet another glass full. "Ooh... I love this Canadian shit. They brew a mean whiskey."

"Sir, I-I-I've never.. nev--never.. I have nev---" I continued to stammer.

"God can't hear you here, Mr. Langley. Relax. You're safe. He thinks I'm punishing everyone, but there are some of you earthly sinners who intrigue me."

He drank and drank, the bottle never emptying, always refilling after every poured glass. I took another sip. I felt parched, but I knew alcohol wasn't going to help.

Satan then asked me about my kill ratio. I sat stunned. What did he mean?

I continued to deny ever murdering anyone. I could see my demonic captor's expression slowly change. He went from excited to annoyed.

"Listen, Mr. Langley," Satan sternly said. "I've seen your record. It shows you've killed several million people from the age of 6 until the day of your death. Hitler and these other assholes may have killed millions, but they didn't actually do the majority of the dirty work. You have! Now, stop fucking with me. I've invited you as a guest into my home. At least speak to me like a man and not some bitch with a stutter."

I mustered all my courage. "Look, Mr. Lucifer," I began. I immediately felt fear return as I stared Satan in his yellow, dreadful eyes. I chugged down my Crown Royal to build confidence and then stared at Satan's forehead to avoid his eyes.

"What?" Satan asked, rubbing his forehead. "Is there a pimple on me?"

I took a few deep breaths before saying, "Lucifer, there's been a mistake. I have not k-kill-killed a single human being in my life. I lived in my-my-mmmmy parent's basement and, uh, and surfed Reddit in between playing hours upon hours of Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto. I-I-I'm, I... I am pretty sure you're mistaking me for someone else."

Satan raised his eyebrows.

"Furthermore," I continued, "I am a virgin. The last time I touched pussy, uh... Last time I-I-I-I touched vagina was on mmm-my way out of my mom's. I shouldn't be here. There are actual rapists outside this, umm, room. I'm-I'm..."

Satan facepalmed himself.

The smack of his palm across his forehead thundered in the room.

"Fuck..." he quietly said.

We sat in silence for what felt like an eternity. Satan leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. He sighed before turning back to me.

"Look, kid. We fucked up. I'm sorry," he said, sighing again. "But now there's nothing I can do to change this."

I felt myself cower into my chair.

"Relax," he said, noticing my fear emerge once again. "You didn't do anything wrong... Uh, I mean, you were a loser, but it wasn't your mistake. This has happened many times before. You losers spend all day playing your PlayBox One and your XStation 4. You actually get into the game and start imagining you really are Super Hilario and Monkey Dong or whatever. That fucks up our system and shows you guys as some bad ass killers when, in fact, you're a bunch of nerds with no aspirations."

He went on to explain that if I kept my mouth shut and just pretended that I was a murderer, he'd give me the royal treatment instead of dumping me in a pit somewhere or having his henchmen have their way with me. I agreed.

We got up to exit the room, but Satan stopped me.

"When you get out there, everyone will want to talk to you. I expect you to pretend you're one of your game characters and just make your stories believable. Can you do that?" he asked.

I replied, "Absolutely."

He grabbed the doorknob and began to turn it, but then turned to me and said, "Oh, and one more thing: you can't be Snake or whatever that Metal Gear Solid shit is. Someone else already told us stories about that."

"Aw, man..."

Score: 2516

Everyone has these tags.  These little buttons on their shirts with a number on it.  Some in the hundreds, some in the thousands.  Mine is number 1.

Pretty quickly people started to figure out that when someone else died, everyone with a lower number moved up.  There wasn’t really much that this meant for the higher numbers, but for the lower numbers it was a bloodbath.  The higher numbers started by trying to kill the numbers above themselves, but there was a reason for the rankings.  5 fell to 3.  3 fell to 2.  Only number 17 managed to kill number 16, and even then it was with 18’s help.  He still wound up hooked to a machine for the short time he managed to live.  

Eventually they realized the better plan was to start killing the numbers lower than you.  2 killed 3-15, then 16 moves up, turns to 3.  That 3 kills 4-73, 74 moves up and becomes 4.  That 4 kills… and on and on.  It led to huge gaps in power between the top ten.  For all that time, nobody set their sights on me.  I’m number one.  Of course I am the strongest.  Far and away.  What can I do?  Only a handful of people ever knew, and that’s all they are now, a handful.  At least that’s what I tell people.  Reality is always such a letdown.   

I control the tags.

I sat at my computer, typing away at the second volume of my memoirs when my phone rang.

"Hey Nic" said my agent

"Yeah"

"We have to talk about your book"

"What about it"

"Well…it would seem that you're claiming it's your memoir"

"Yeah"

"But nearly every event in the book, is a scene from one of your movies"

"What's that?"

"I said but nearly every event in the book…"

"No I heard you. What's a movie?"

"What's a…what's a…"

I heard my agent say 'oh boy'

"Nic, do you know where the money in your bank account comes from?"

"That time I found the treasure?"

"No that was National Treasure"

"That time I found the answer to all those conspiracy theories"

"That was The Rock"

"That time…"

"Yeah I'm just going to nip this in the bud and say no"

"So where does it come from"

"From your movies"

"What?"

"Ok you know how sometimes when you do things there's people with cameras filming you?"

"Is that what they're doing?"

"Ok, just to confirm you really don't know what movies are right?"

"No"

"Ok try not to do anything, I'm going to contact Shia Labeouf and figure out how to spin this as performance art"

"Shia Labeouf, the guy who fought all those transformers?"

"I'm hanging up now"

The line went dead and I hung up. I went back to writing about that time I was on the earth when it was destroyed, wondering if I should dedicate a whole chapter to how I'm actually three gnomes wearing a trench coat wearing a Nicholas Cage costume or if I should save that for the author's biography on the dust flap.

#### [WP] Death always lets the doomed challenge him to any sport or game to save their lives. Death comes for a six-year-old boy. Death doesn't remember learning about Calvinball.

Score: 2512

For pity, perhaps, he went along with it, even though the rules made a final win impossible. If a few millenia had taught him anything, it was that this process need not be painful. Not in the moment. Later, when the realization of loss reverberates in and around those left behind, the pain would be as real and unavoidable as the sky. But that was not for him. He would be long gone. All that mattered was the boy. Would he come quietly, in peace?

He lay the scythe behind a tree and chased the boy with the golden hair, dusty orange stuffed tiger clutched close to his chest. The boy was unperturbed by this stranger. The boy explained the game - utter nonsense, he thought but did not say - and he agreed to the parameters. He hummed and harmonized with a Tum Tum as the song proclaimed the beginning. He grabbed a flag.

"Tag!" the boy shouted, "for four points!"

"Tag back," he said as he extended a bony finger, "for four!"

"No no no," the boy said, "the flag is now the Spire of Protection, so I am safe and you must recite Happy Birthday while Hobbes dances."

He obliged as best he could, his voice warbly and raw. He could not remember the last time he sang.

"The mask!" the boy said as he approached with a rag with two holes. 

The dark man took the mask and wrapped his skull. They ran with waving flags. The ball flew through the sky, a brilliant red rubber ball shining against the white clouds above. The warm fall sun brought sweat to the boy's brow. The dark man had long ago lost his last bit of sweating flesh, but he still knew the heat. 

"What is the score?"

"Seven to Washington," the boy said breathlessly. The disease was thick in his lungs. It would not be long.

"Hobbes has something to say," the boy shouted. 

"What is that, Mr. Tiger?" the dark man said, his skepticism and detachment both eroded by the boy's effervescence.

He was startled as the tiger transmogified into a larger, vibrant, living version of itself.

"He's tired," the tiger said in a whisper. 

"His life... so real, so unyielding," the dark man said. "I don't think he will come."

"Allow me," the tiger said.

He took the boy's hand and held it close.

"Calvin," the tiger said.

"You're it!" Calvin shouted.

"No... Calvin, it's time to rest," the tiger said. 

"But the sun!" he said.

"Come with me," the tiger said. He lead the boy hand-in-hand to edge of the glade. 

"We have a magical world ahead. Let's go exploring."

The dark man lifted his scythe and followed the two, treading lightly lest he disturb them. The tiger brought the boy into the light, and then they were all gone. Behind them the leaves steadily fell on the soft glade and the grass and all the world left gave a silent elegy.

#### [WP] Ok, bad news, good news. Bad news: you've died and have gone to Hell. Good news: since so many humans have died in recent years, humans have long since outnumbered demons 1000 to 1 and turned Hell into a pretty nice place.

Score: 2481

"It was the Nazis that did it," the tour guide explained. "A bit ironic, really. Hell was already far overcrowded, but most damned souls were too beaten down and dejected to do anything about it. But there were so many soldiers pouring into Hell during the last days of World War II that the demons just couldn't process them fast enough. They had to set up these big temporary camps to house them all until Satan could personally determine their worst nightmare to torture them. Well wouldn't you know it, the Nazis didn't really like being herded together and put into camps! So they led the uprising against Satan's minions." 

The guide's high heels clicked against the marble floor as she walked over to a massive painting, at least the size of a football field, depicting the first battle. According to the little placard, this had taken Caravaggio six years to paint. Post-uprising Hell was full of some incredible artwork, now that the great masters had been released from their prisons and were given limitless time and resources to make what they need. Even the Atrium that contained the waiting line to get into Hell made the Louvre look like an Alabama garage sale. 

"Chancellor Hitler proclaimed amnesty for all past crimes committed up on the surface and dedicated himself to building this new utopia. Really, it was perfect for him and his many followers: the Jews, as God's Chosen People, are almost all up in Heaven. It seems that God cares more about the status of the tip of your penis and whether you eat pork than whether you were a virtuous person. So, no 'Final Solution' necessary in Hell.  Hitler restored order and even put the demons to work conjuring whatever society needs."

She led the way to another portrait, easily recognizable by the thin toothbrush mustache. The portrait was by Michaelangelo, who seemed to have taken the rejection from Heaven rather personally. He'd done a whole series of statues on the hypocrisy of the Bible and God himself. Another nearby picture showed Hitler summitting Lucifer's black stone throne and throwing Satan himself into the Abyss. "It's apocryphal, of course," the guide assured us. "In fact, no one knows what happened to Lucifer. He managed to flee in the midst of the fighting. Some say he returned to Heaven and asked for God's forgiveness. Others suggest that he's hiding out somewhere on Earth, trying to build his kingdom anew there."

She led the way to the next exhibit, where a video showed Dr. Sigmund Freud establishing a psychological institute to help the damned recover from centuries of torture. It turns out that God wasn't a big fan of psychologists; something about how they had usurped the traditional confessional role of priests or something. He didn't care too much that they were just trying to help people. There's a little saying in Hell that God's rules are about as fixed and permanent as a gust of wind. Shit, most people here thought that they were pretty pious back when they were still alive. You'd be shocked at just how many popes there are down here. "Everyone pitched in," the guide narrated as the video showed a montage of humans filling in the pits of fire and brimstone, and planting farms and gardens. No one needed to eat down here, it was just nice to have fields and pastures. "Everyone did their part to make Hell a better place." The video ended with an overview of the massive city skyline, full of flying cars and all sorts of other futuristic concepts. You'd be surprised what Einstein, Da Vinci, and uncountable other geniuses could accomplish with unlimited time and resources. 

The final exhibit on the tour was titled *The Future.* "Chancellor Hitler's vision of Hell is not limited to just creating a paradise here," the guide continued as we walked through the door. "Though Hell has been retaken from the demons, there are still *billions* of souls on the surface, suffering and toiling through God's tests. Trying to scrape by on meager food because God thinks hardship will inspire faith. Trying to fight greed and lust because God has taught them that they shouldn't enjoy food and flesh. Torturing themselves when they should be living their lives as they want. Just like we do down here."

The exhibit was not grandly decorated by works by famous masters. The walls were bare and the room was hardly lit. Only a single bulb illuminated one exhibit, a small glittering object of metal gears and glass panes. "This is a prototype," she said, "Of the machine that will open up The Doorway."

#### [WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.

Score: 2473

“So where are ya heading?” Jim asked, his turning down the secluded dirt road. It was his favorite spot for murdering thus far. Granted, it may have also been his only one thus far...

The woman had hardly said a word since he picked her up. She seemed bored, constantly staring out of her passenger window. It was all wrong. He liked to get them comfortable before doing the deed.

“Just the bus station,” she said.

“Really?” Jim raised an eyebrow. “What’s a pretty little miss like you needing to ride a gross bus for?”

“My mother’s in the hospital.”

*Shit*, he thought. *It’s okay. Deep breaths, you can fix this.*

“I’m sorry to hear that,” Jim said with faux concern. He checked his gas light. The red light had flashed long enough. Just a little bit more…

Like an answer to his prayers, the truck began to sputter. It shook, the arrow on the speedometer slowly descending to zero. He frowned, hoping the woman wouldn’t see glee behind his mask. He didn't want to make her nervous. 

“Dammit,” Jim barked as he banged on the steering wheel. “I’m out of gas. We’ll have to pull over.”

The woman shrugged, silent as ever. Something about her gesture made Jim nervous. He had never seen a hitchhiker look so indifferent. Yet, he liked it. She was his first true challenge.

***

Jean stood to the side as Jim fiddled with the oil pan of his car.

*He really is a moron, isn’t he? People are usually a little suspicious of hitchhikers but he’s treating me like a long lost friend. Shame, since I’ll be slitting his throat any moment now.*

“Excuse me?” Jim called, breaking her thoughts.

Jean blinked, turning in his direction. The man had a goofy grin as he looked back at her, a streak of grease on his cheek. *A true idiot*

“What?” she asked, crossing her arms.

“Well, I was wondering if you could give me a little help over here. It’s a tad complicated.”

“Putting gas in your car is complicated?”

“I never said I was a mechanic”

Jean sighed, walking over to help the dimwitted man. The closer she got, the more she noticed something… *off* about him. His demeanor, the way he hid a hand behind his back. She had practiced the same thing a thousand times before. It was a ploy - a bad one at that.

“What the fuck?” Jean furrowed her brow, backing away. “You have a knife, too?”

“What?” Jim began to sweat profusely. He wiped his forehead, revealing the gleam of a butcher’s cleaver in his closed fist. “Ah shit, wrong hand. But it's not what it looks like. I just keep this to check the fuselage and… wait, did you say ‘too’?”

Jean reddened, pulling her jacket closer to her body. The chilling sensation of the blade's flat side brushed against her side. So much for keeping her weapon a secret.

“Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t,” she started. “What’s it to you?”

Jim smiled, still cheery but different. Somehow more pleasant.

“You’re the Hitchhiking Murderer!” he said. “I’ve heard about you while watching TV. I must say, I’m a fan of your work.”

Jean stood flustered. “I… uh, thank you?”

“Jim Miller,” the man extended his hand. “I’m still new to the scene but I guess you could say I’m your opposite. I like to kill hitchhikers, rather than be one. I'll tell you, I never thought we’d cross paths this way. You’re even more beautiful than the rough sketches of you on the ten o'clock news.”

Jean blushed. *He can’t be serious.*

“Thanks,” she paused. “So, are you not going to try and kill me?”

Jim shrugged. “I guess not. We don’t have to compete in the same pool for our victims so there’s no need to be territorial, right?”

“I guess.”

“So it’s settled.” Jim smiled. “We’re cool.”

“Right…”

Jean backed away, her eyes still glued to Jim's knife. He appeared friendly but if she learned anything, it was she couldn’t take chances. Yet, something told her he would stick to his word. He may have been a killer, but he was the earnest type.

“Hey,” she said, standing on the edge of the forest. Her voice echoed in the brisk night air as Jim perked his head up in anticipation of her words. “Next time, don’t make it so obvious that you’ll run out of gas. I could see you glancing at the meter every few seconds. And for the love of Christ, don’t show your knife until you’re about to kill someone. It's reeks of amateurishness. Don't give a bad name for the rest of us.”

Jim nodded, giving her a thumbs up. “You got it! Maybe one day, I’ll show you how much I’ve improved. I'll earn my name as an established serial killer and make you proud.”

Jean fought back smiling herself. *Stupid as ever*

“Yeah,” she said, melting into the safety of the foliage. “Maybe one day.”

#### [WP] You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago. Today he gives it back and says, "I need a favor."

Score: 2465

His voice is difficult to describe.


Picture this: your eardrum is a cigarette filter and his mouth is the burning sunspot of the lit end.


Whenever he speaks, it’s like your brain’s taking a long, long drag.


*”Remember that little deal we had a while back?”*


Deal? More like ‘scam’. “The deal we made when I was just a kid? *Yeah,* I remember that deal.”


*”Whoa, now,”* he said. *”I’m detecting a little bit of acid in your speech, there. You angry about something?”*



“You made a deal with an eight year-old, you colossal douchebag. I wanted to be a ‘space cowboy’, and you took my soul over that?” I shook my head. “What the hell, man?”


*“Right. About that...”* He smiled and it was like watching a crack form in the glacial north arctic. Every time he did it you just knew that some polar bear was getting his life screwed over. *“Turns out,”* he said, with that same smile, *“that your little eight year-old fantasy may not be so useless after all.”*

I turned around and started locking up the drawers. I was closing up the coffee shop tonight. “Get to the point, Devil.”

His eyes glimmered with some inner light. *“Well, I have a particularly difficult task I need your expertise with. I need some space cowboying done.”*

“You’re shitting me.”

*”I shit you not. Do this for me, and you’ve got your soul back.”*

***

Apparently, demons, angels and all of that nonsense have pretty unlimited power anywhere that *isn’t* outer-space.

*”Yeah,”* said the Devil. *”Not our domain, breaching contract, etcetera etcetera. Point is, we can’t really go into the ‘void’ or anything. Not even in a ship. If we want to get to a planet we gotta take the worm tubes.”*

“…So why don’t you just do that?”


*”Well, this target of mine is on something called a ‘space-station’. You heard of that?”*

“Of course I have. I’m not an idiot.”

He shrugged. *”I can never really tell with you mortals. Anyway, you’re going to need to get on this,”* he traced air quotes with his fingers, *“‘space-station’, and then you’re going to retrieve my little item. Think you can do that?”*

No, of course I didn’t think I could do that. But this was my immortal soul we were talking about, here. How could I do anything less than try? “Sure, I think I can do that. How do I get there?”

*”Well, you’re going to take a worm tube to your launch point, first. Wouldn’t want you to have to worry about all the niggly aspects of interstellar travel that ain’t instantaneous, you know?”*

“Where’s the tube?”

*“Where’s the…?”* He laughed and held up something suspiciously like a detonator. He put on his best Wizard of Oz voice and boomed, *“The tube was always inside you! The tube was always…!”*

Then he clicked the button and the world faded through white.

***

I didn’t stop throwing up for what felt like hours.

When I could finally look up, a horned face looked down at me with angry red eyes. The Devil usually cleaned himself up, but it looked like his underling demons didn’t really give a shit if they looked like the combined result of a halloween bargain bin and the nightmares of a toddler.

His voice was gruff. “You are ’Gabe’?”

I spit the taste of vomit out of my mouth. “Yeah, that’s me.”

He snorted. “Come with me.” 

I followed his spiny back through a pair of airlocks, a de-licing room—“You kidding me, fellas? I don’t have lice!”—a decontamination room, and finally, a prep room.

Hornface pointed at a locker. “Suit is in there. Put it on, get ready.”

He watched me intently. 

I cleared my throat, “Uh, not going to give me some privacy, here?”

“Why you need privacy?”

“I’m about to get naked, bud.”

“So? I am also naked.”

He… had kind of a point. I wasn’t going to press the issue, so I got out of my clothes, slipped into an undersuit, and worked my way into the outer hard-shelled carapace.

It all came so easy. Like I’d been doing this for decades. 

Hornface grunted. “Ready now?”

“Yeah, yeah.” I did final seal checks and gave my helmet a good knock for good luck. “Where are we headed now?”


“Your ship.”


***

The space-ship was something only a hellspawn could have devised. It was covered in what looked like volcanic rock, with glowing orange rivulets running hot in the contours and gothic spikes thrusting up off the hull like undersea vents.

“Really, guys? Not even thinking about aerodynamics here, huh?”

Hornface shrugged. “No air in space. If no aerodynamics, why not make look cool?”

“You know, Hornface, you’re really not as stupid as you sound.”

He scowled. “English not first language. Maybe you try speaking in Tongues?” 

The demon spoke fluent gibberish for a good half minute before I said, “Yeah, maybe not.”

He pushed me towards the cockpit and said, “You go now. Computer tell you what do.”

Uh-huh. I jumped into the cockpit and it locked closed around me. The thing was shot through with a diffuse orange glow.

“Um. Computer?”

The console came alive with red light, and there was a voice: “WHAT DO YOU WANT, PEASANT?”

“Jesus, computer. Lighten up.”

“LIGHTENING UP IS NOT IN MY PROGRAMMING. STATE YOUR REQUEST, FOOL.”

Just like the Devil to give me a ship that berates me. What a dick.

“Start up nav for this space station I’m supposed to get on.”

“BE POLITE AND PERHAPS I WILL DO THIS.”

“Start up nav, *please.*” Fucking computer.

“PERFORMING AS REQUESTED. BRACE FOR ACCELERATION.”

I tried to ‘brace for acceleration’, I really did. But instead I got my teeth rattled so hard you could have sworn I was playing the maracas.

*** 

After a good half hour of having my body smushed up against the seat, the computer finally said:

“YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT YOUR DESTINATION.”

Thank fucking God.

“NOW RETURNING MANUAL CONTROL. GOOD LUCK WITH EVASIVE MANEUVERS.”

Wait, *what?* Two joysticks flipped up from the console and the main-screen went bright with the afterburners of a thousand missiles. Defensive emplacements. *Shit.*

My hands went to the sticks like they were magnetized, and I whipped the ship into a roll. It was all instinct.

“YES, ROLLS. THE BEST MANEUVER FOR DIZZYING YOURSELF AND EASING THE SWEET EMBRACE OF DEATH.”

I zipped past the first cluster of missiles and swooped low under what looked like a pure white archway.

What I didn’t realize was that I was flying straight through a half-meter of stained glass.

The ship shuddered and the glass cracked to pieces, and about 60% of the missiles slammed into the arch and took it off the space-station’s hull.

…Which still left around 400 missiles on my ass.

“MAY I RECOMMEND MAKING PEACE WITH YOUR GOD?”

I hit the accelerator and went in a wide loop, dragging as many missiles I could with me. The lagging ones clustered up, came flush up against each other, and disappeared in a flash.

Still about a hundred missiles, real close now. They could accelerate much faster than what was physiologically possible for me.

Shit. 

“Computer, do we have weapons systems?”

“OH, RIGHT. WE DO.”

“Shoot them, you son of a bitch!”

“SHOOTING, SHOOTING…”

The cockpit rumbled as the guns on my ship’s hull took out the missiles with a couple hundred thousand bullets. 

“How do I get inside this thing? And what the hell am I supposed to find?”

“MARKING ENTRANCE POINTS NOW. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HARD DRIVE.”

“A hard drive?”

“DID I STUTTER?”

***

I jumped through some obscure airlock in a nook on the massive space-station and found my way inside. 

The hardline inside my helmet crackled. “THE STATION IS SPARSELY INHABITED. THE HARD DRIVE SHOULD BE LOCATED… HERE.”

A nav-point sparked orange in my vision.

Alright, easy enough. Follow the yellow-brick road, and all. And maybe—

I stopped.

Behind me was this conspicuous silence—like when there are footsteps matching yours in a dark alley, and you stop to see if they continue, but all you hear is this loud and pregnant quiet.

I kept walking, and could swear something was doing the same behind me.

It raised the hairs on my neck. 

By the time I reached the pick-up point, I had almost gotten used to the Computer’s insane drawlings. 

“I HOPE YOU GET CAUGHT AND ANALLY PROBED.”

The hard drive was squirreled away in a filing cabinet, just like any other hard drive. I picked it up, put in my pouch, and turned to face the most ugly-pleasant thing I have ever seen.

It was ugly because of all the warts and facial protrusions, and pleasant because the expression of its face was calmer than a zen cow. 

“Ah… Hello?”

“THAT IS AN ELDIL YOU DINKUS. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.”

“What do I do with it?”

“IGNORE IT AND COME BACK TO THE SHIP.”

I waved goodbye and the Eldil stared serenely through me. Weird.

Anyway, time to run. I had a soul waiting for me.

***

A hop, skip, and a worm-tube later and I was back in the empty coffee shop. The Devil was smoking a cigar in the dark.

*”You got the stuff?”*

“You got the money?” I cleared my throat, “Ehrm, I mean, you got my soul?”

He snapped and I felt… nothing at all. Sometimes I thought that these demon-types *made up* the idea of souls, just so they could have something to hold over you. Leverage. There’s no way I’d risk *not* believing though, you know? The cost of being wrong would be way too huge. Which I guess is how the whole scam worked.

The Devil clicked his fingers on the table. *”I’m waiting.”*

I tossed him the hard drive and he smiled that killer’s smile. *”Thank you.”* 

And then he ripped the drive in two with his bare hands. He crushed the two separate pieces to dust.

“What was on that thing, anyway?”

*”The contract keeping us from going up there,”* he said, pointing skyward.

“Space? Why do you want to go there, anyway?”

His face split into a rictus. *”It’s the final frontier, my boy. The final frontier.”*

#### [WP] You're on your death bed, and the personification of your greatest regret has come to say goodbye.

Score: 2463

A stranger has come to visit me. She says she is family, but I have no family. No wife, no children, no parents, no siblings. I've never laid eyes on her before. Nonetheless, I can't deny our connection. She has my clear grey eyes and ginger hair and the same distinctive jawline and cheekbones. And moreover, the tenderness with which she treats me in my fragile state, clinging to this world by a thread, says more than appearances ever could. She is sorry she never had the chance to see me before and she sheds a tear at seeing me in this state, and the gentle warmth of her hand round mine is all the comfort in the world. 

She tells me about her life. Her happy family childhood back in my old home town, after I'd already left. The success she'd enjoyed at college, buoyed up by the support from her father telling her that hard work would bring such rewards. The hard lessons she'd learnt in love and the joy she'd won in return when she discovered what was right for her. Whatever my conservative views, I could feel her joy when she described falling in love with a woman for the first time and my antipathy towards that lifestyle was swept away by the smile on her face. 

She asked me about my life. My sorry childhood didn't match up to hers, raised with the fear of hell and beatings that left me always battling to prove myself as an adult. When I left for university it was a weight released, but the discipline stood me in good stead. My self-control won me awards, a career that from the first day supported me, the girl I loved, our dream wedding and home and everything she and I wanted. But then my need to prove myself took everything away. When I was offered my dream job on the other coast, she wouldn't come. Her family and friends meant more to her than me. She wanted me to decline it, but I saw that as failure. She stayed and I went and we tossed our marriage away. 

I threw myself into my career to numb the pain, and my success was tremendous, but with no one to make happy with it, the shine was gone. Woman after woman came into my life and left but I never found love again. Looking into this stranger's eyes, I can see my ex-wife's love for me shining through and what I've known for years comes flooding out in tears - I walked away from the best thing I could ever have had. 

She cradles me close as the regret consumes me. I blink through my tears and ask her, *what if? What if I'd stayed? I could've been so happy. I could've had the world.* I wish I'd realised then what was of true value, as I do now. Here I am, alone, with only a stranger to see me through my darkest, final night.

She wipes away my tears with gentle fingers. *The world,* she whispers, *and more. Your wife would have loved you more each day. And you could have had me, dad. You could have had me.*

#### [WP] Soul mates are real and technology has finally allowed for detection of some peoples “other half" at the speed of light using quantum messaging. When you were tested there was no response, now 10 years later you are called in to let you know a response has just arrived.

Score: 2440

I'm probably the only person in the world who was happier *before* the Match Database was invented. 

I went on my eighteenth birthday with my twin brother Erik as soon as we were eligible for testing. The line stretched around the block, as it was still a fairly new technology back then. There were still people in their pre-Match relationships, which don't really exist now. Nowadays, the only people who need to use the service are those who are just coming of age. The thing about the Match Database is that you only ever need to use it once. "Soul mate" means a companion for life, and once you've found that one, there's never a need to use the database again. Unless you're like me, that is.

Erik found his match right away. He sent out the standard message with his name, contact information, etc. And the response came back immediately from his soul mate, Trinh. I still remember his beaming smile, and he was already on his smartphone booking a flight to Vietnam. And then I stepped up to the terminal and put my hand in for testing. The machine glowed blue, indicating that a match had been found and a connection set. So I sent the message.

I looked around the clinic, not sure what should have happened. It seemed like Erik's response was instantaneous. All soul mates were roughly the same age, so most were tested around the same time and could message back and forth almost immediately. "It's all right," the clinic tech answered. "Sometimes it takes a while, like if your match is asleep at the moment. It happens a lot with all of the different time zones. Just go home and wait for the answer."

----

I've been waiting for ten years now. Ten long years of having every person I know rub their happiness in my face. Erik and Trinh, married now, are really the only ones who at least try not to make me feel bad about it. But even between them, I can *feel* their energy. Their strong connection. And their happiness. And it always just reminds me of what I'm missing out on. 

I used to hate dating back in high school before I got matched. I really did. I was shy and clumsy and tongue-tied and I never knew what to talk about. You have *no idea* what I'd give to go on an awkward blind date now. There are no more single people left. That's not an exaggeration: *everyone* has used the match clinic and found their soul mate. As far as I know, I'm the only person who never got a response. I've heard of people waiting up to a year, but no further than that. 

I try to maintain a normal life. I have a studio apartment, which are a rarity nowadays. Most of them have been combined into spacious one-bedrooms for all of the couples out there. At least the lack of demand leads to some pretty cheap rent for me, right? The only way to survive as the only single man in the world is to stay positive. 

At work, I'm a fairly solitary person. I keep my head down and get my work done on time. I eat lunch at my desk while everyone else usually meets their soul mate for an hour or so mid-day. A lot of them go out for happy hour and such afterwards, but I usually head straight home. You'd think that being with friends would cheer me up, but it just reminds me that I'm an eternal third wheel. At least my cat and my TV don't have soul mates to rub in my face.

-----

I went into the Match Database clinic the other day. The bored attendant was certainly shocked to see me, a 28-year-old man. Everyone my age had been Matched successfully a decade ago. "Um... can I help you?" he asked. 

"I want a new match," I told him. 

He looked down at the machine, then back at me. "What?"

"A new match!" I yelled, louder than I'd intended. I pounded a fist on the counter and glared at him. "How hard is that to understand?"

He shrank back against the far wall and pushed the machine toward me. "I don't think that's how it works..." he stammered. 

I picked the machine up and smashed it to the ground, where it exploded in a spray of plastic bits and wires. Just for good measure, I kicked a few of the pieces and then stormed out.

That was the night I tried to commit suicide.

-----

"David?" It was Erik, as usual. He's generally the only person who calls me now that Mom has passed on. "I think you need to come over here." 

I sighed and rolled over to check the clock. 10 A.M., far earlier than I normally woke up now that I'd lost my job. "Why?" I asked. It was a question that I'd been asking a lot recently. Why go on?

"Just come," Erik said. "It's worth it, I promise."

I grumbled, but in the end managed to get out of bed and scrape together the effort to shower and dress. If it had been anyone other than Erik, I would have just hung up. 

I pulled up in front of our old house, where Erik and Trinh now lived with their little daughter, and took a deep breath before exiting the car. It seemed like everything was a chore nowadays, and I was just too tired to continue. Half of me wanted to just drive back home and crawl back under the covers and wallow in my own pity for a while longer. But then I noticed the car parked in the driveway. Not Erik's, nor Trinh's. And curiosity got the better of me. 

The doorbell chimed cheerfully, and Trinh answered the door with a wide grin. "David!" She wrapped her arms around me in a big hug. "I'm so happy you came!" She was normally a pretty upbeat person, but this was over the top even for her. Maybe she was overcompensating for the cloud of gloom that hovered over me at all times. "Come in!"

She led me into the living room, where Erik was sipping coffee with the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. Long black hair flowed over her pale shoulders, and she had sparkling, vivid blue eyes. 

"David!" Erik said as I entered the room. "So great to see you. *This*," he gestured to the woman, "Is Candice."

Reality came rushing back, and I remembered who I was. Like everyone else, Candice would have a soul mate. How could she *not*? My constant stormclouds reappeared.

"It's a pleasure to finally meet you," she said softly. 

*Finally?*

"Candice here has been in a coma," Erik said. He could barely contain the eager enthusiasm in his voice. "For the past *eleven* years. She said that she heard your name and address in a dream."

*Eleven years...* My mind had stopped working.

She batted her eyelashes. "I got your message, David."

#### [WP] A group of Viking encounters a Siren at sea, her voice is luring the men to their doom - except one. Now it's up to a closeted gay Viking to save the day.

Score: 2439

Bjarke heard a melodious voice sail over the sides of the longship, weaving promises in the minds of those around him.

For the love of Odin, he thought, rolling his eyes. It's a damn Siren.

He looked at his men, who were entranced by the hypnotizing voice and moving close to the railing. If he didn't act soon, he'd lose his whole daft crew in seconds to the cunning beast. Bjarke spent the next several minutes strongarming his magicked crew into the belly of the longship before bolting the door shut from the outside. Lucky for him, his mother had been a witch and he was able to knock them out with a simple spell. That would prevent any of them from hacking a hole in the side of his ship. He worked hard to build it and Bjarke wasn't about to let some song-drunk idiot sink it.

The lilting voice grew stronger as the Siren tried to beckon the men. Bjarke stepped up to the railing.

"For Thor's sake, shut the hell up, you hussy!" he shouted over the gray water.

He saw head pop out of the water, rage written on her beautiful features. In an instant, the silver-haired Siren was at the side of the longship and scowling up at him.

"Hussy!" she shrieked. "Listen here you sansorðinn! I may be a lot of things but a hussy is not one of them. I will drag you down to a watery death."

Bjarke give her an amused smile. It would be a joy to tease this creature.

He brought his meticulously cared for nails to his face for inspection before saying, "What could you possibly need with all the men on my ship if not to be a hussy."

The woman sputtered in shock before summoning a wave to push herself onto the boat's deck. Bjarke yelped in surprise as he was soaked from head to toe. Great. This was one of his nicest shirts and now it was covered in seaweed and salt water. Blinking the stinging water from his eyes, the Viking saw the Siren stand up, her scaled tail disappearing now that she was no longer in the water. She stood before him naked, her long silvery strands of hair covering her breasts.

"You listen to me," she hissed, poking him in the chest with sharp fingernail. "I am Iona, a magnificent creature of the sea descended from Ægir himself. I will not be reduced to the image of a wanton woman by the likes of you."

Bjarke merely stared at Iona, unperturbed.

"Why are you not affected by my singing," the Siren asked, suddenly curious. "You are a male of a hale and hearty stock. You should have been one of the first to respond to my beckoning."

Bjarke's eye twitched. Yes, she would think that, wouldn't she. This was a secret he had kept close always. A secret that, if revealed, would come with a price. He was not ready to lose all he had worked hard for.

"Yeah, well. Not all of us are tricked by your charms."

Iona pursed her lips and circled him like a vulture.

"Hmmm," she said, tapping a finger to her lips. She glanced down towards his groin. "Are you lacking the needed equipment?"

Bjarke glared at her.

"I have perfectly working 'equipment' thank you very much."

Iona's perfectly shaped brows raised up high in realization.

"You're fuðflogi," she said, breathlessly. "That makes so much sense."

The Viking shushed the Siren harshly.

"Yes," he said in a hushed voice, despite the fact they were the only two conscious on the longship. "But no one knows."

"It is not an evil thing to desire the love of another man," Iona said to the burly, bearded man.

"Not everyone sees it that way," he said gruffly, running his hand over his braided blonde hair. "I will have to marry soon or else they will know."

"I will make you a deal," Iona said, taking sudden pity on the man. "I will help make you the most feared viking in the world if you take me away from this Odin-forsaken spit of land I've been stuck on. "

Bjarke looked at the silver-haired maiden curiously.

"You are a Siren," he said. "Can you not travel the waters freely?"

"Not as freely as you think," she said, sadly. "If I am captured in my human form, I am bound to them and the magic chaining me to this barren place will be split. I will instead by chained to you until you die."

"I would not wish that on anyone," he said.

"It is what I wish. It seems it would not be so bad to be chained to you until your death," Iona said thoughtfully. "I will appear as your wife and help you claim the world. Then we will both be free. I am able to mask my voice as to not charm your village. All you need to do is bind me to you through blood."

Bjarke looked at her, considering her offer. From his belt he drew a knife, slicing a shallow cut down is arm. He held it out to Iona, who mimicked his actions.

"Deal."

"Right. Today, we're brewing the most amazing polyjuice potion. Notoriously difficult to pull off, but if done right, the results are absolutely stunning."

"The most important aspect to any potion-making is fresh ingredients and polyjuice is no exception. Dried lacewing flies and dehydrated boomslang skin won't do and you'll end up looking like a fucking mannequin."

An hour later, cauldrons were bubbling away and the new instructor was striding around the room assessing the students' progress.

"Right, Longbottom. What the hell is this?" he asked, lifting up the ladle from the cauldron and letting the watery contents slowly pour out.

"It's polyjuice..." Neville mumbled.

"IT'S A FUCKING DISASTER IS WHAT IT IS! Get your head out your ass, clean the shit out your ears, and start again!"

Draco Malfoy snickered in the back of the room.

The instructor spun around, staring daggers at Malfoy.

"You. Malfoy. Lid off your cauldron."

Draco lifted the lid off and recoiled as a multicolored fume of foul- smelling smoke shot out.

"Oh my god, how the hell did you manage that? That's not polyjuice potion, it's POLYJUICE-FUCKING-SEWAGE! BIN IT AND START AGAIN YEAH?"

Draco nodded wordlessly

"HOW ABOUT A "YES CHEF"?"

"Y-yes chef!" Draco yelped

All the other students were staring intently at their cauldrons. At least there would be no Slytherin favoritism this year.

#### [WP] Do the crime, do the time - but the reverse is also true, you can choose to serve jail time in advance of any crime you want to commit. After voluntarily spending 50 years in prison one individual is set to be released and the world watches in anticipation of whatever they do next.

Score: 2412

After fifty years of willing incarceration, I left. My time had been served with no crime to its name, and now, I could put that time towards any offence I chose. A smile played at my lips.

The world watched as I took my first step from prison. Underfoot, the pavement created a mosaic: the hard, blackened crust of society cracked under the steady press of nature. I watched it, silent. The click of cameras and shouts of reporters faded from my ears. The rays of the sun flowed over me, and my lungs filled with fresh air until every dark nook that had festered for fifty years was eradicated. I released the darkness in a breath. At the hiss, the nearest camera man squeaked and scurried back. My smile grew.

The pavement crackled as I took another step. Around me, the ring of humanity expanded. Fingers tightened around microphones, faces paled, and arms shook. The power of it surged through me with my next breath, and a chuckle broke free.

I stepped again, then again. The crowd expanded, and the mosaic crumbled further underfoot. I was not trapped; not by walls, or barbed wire. Not by guards or guns. Not even society could hold me, for I had embraced the punishment it offered and come out the other side unbroken.

I left the crowds behind and fear in my wake. Yet, it was not me they feared; it was what I carried. For years, people believed me imprisoned while they walked free, but in truth, it was the opposite. While their walls of rules and intimidation grew, mine fell away. Now, I was free, and in my freedom they saw their prison. And they knew they would never leave.

MR GUMPUS
--------------------------


"Good night Mr Gumpus." I said, shifting him into the crook of my arm. His patchy fuzz scratching my neck as it has for so long. Over the years his fur has slowly been going, I have replaced his glass eye's so many times I can do it in my sleep now. I have repaired his arm onto his body before in one of the many fights with my sister. Neither of us every know what we fight for any more but it has been going off and on for the last year or so.

About the same amount of time that mommy has really gotten into those adult drinks she wont share with us.

I try to smile into my pillow as I used to when I thought of mom. The memories of being tucked in, of being soothed to sleep. Her comforting hand on my head when even Mr Gumpus was not enough.

Now I just remember her sitting in front of the tv waiting for daddy to finally get home.

He works so hard these days. Some nights, like tonight, I dont even get to see him before he gets home. He is not there to kiss me good night, to check my closet or below my bed for monsters. He never remembers to leave the door slightly open either. I need Mr Gumpus.

I can feel the soft blanket of night settle over me and snuggle deeper against Mr Gumpus.

"Poor kid." I mutter as I watch Michael finally succumb to sleep. I am too old now, too old for this. Checking my dodgy arm to see if his work will hold this time. Looks good but a little stiff. At least this time I will have both eyes. That was a bad few weeks when I had no depth perception. I barely kept the monster at bay.

Straightening up out of Michael's sleeping grip I readied myself. Another night of battle. I should have been retired years ago but he kept holding on. Poor bastard. I did not have a lot left in me. Looking over my patched and worn form I thought that I probably did not have much longer left, neither of us did.

I could hear Mary down in the den, the TV running way too loud. Another heavy night of drinking. I wonder what excuse Paul will bring home tonight. He has been getting worse and worse. Shivering as I recall the event two weeks ago. That had really taken the stuffing out me. Grinning mirthlessly at the old pun I could still remember the front door banging open. The smell of beer and cigarettes heavy in the air. Fighting against the plume of smoke and alcohol sprites as they tried to enter Michaels room. I had kept them at bay.

Then Mary had heard him. Stomping up the hallway, bringing with her a cloud of betrayal sprites. When she saw him in his state there was no defense that Paul could offer this time. His usual bout of "Late work" or "international call" would not do it. Even so I could see the lying wisps flickering around his head but thankfully none of them were fully formed.

Shaking my head I brought myself back to the present as I heard a taxi outside. Readying myself, I didn't know what to expect tonight but for Michael's sake I would try. I felt so goddamn tired. I should have been given a proper burial years ago, added to the other fallen warriors into the great Box in the Attic. No time for pity now, the front door was opening.

Instantly seduction and infidelity wisps, fully grown, started to stream into Michaels room. I stood straight up on the side of his bed and starting to fight. Shielded with Trust and Faith, my trusty short swords I spun them through the air, matching their dancing flights. There were too many!

Paul's heavy breathing in the hallway summoned alcohol and pain fairies into existence with each breath. They flocked towards Michael, threatening to destroy him. Arms blurring I kept them at bay. Trust and Faith were flashing faster and faster, my repaired arm was already starting to ache. No! Mary had not even shown up yet! Not tonight, I would not let them through tonight! The fairies and wisps were circling ahead trying to find a way past my defenses. I would not let them.

The sound of the TV from the den died.

I got a brief respite from the battle. They attackers were waiting for reinforcements. Mary was coming.

"What the hell kind of time do you call this!?" The cry bounced down the corridor bringing jealousy and its own pain fairies winging along with it. The battle was rejoined. They struck.

I was dancing, spinning my way through the forms taught to me by my Master, The Great Pillow Lion. I could do this, I could feel the tide of the battle holding. I just had to keep it up. My fur was fraying more and more but I could keep this up. I could for Michael.

"Lay off Mary. I have had a long day and I just want to get home without you yelling at me!" Paul rejoined. Oh God. Resentment worms, giant pale slugs had started to inch their way across the threshold. Spiralling and keeping an eye on them, I had heard tales of these but never had to face them in battle. Not tonight, please.

"You had a long day? A long day with that 'secretary' of yours no doubt!" These were no longer pain fairies, they were too big! Giant winged monsters, dark black and mottled red started to zip into the room. Their ponderous leathery wings joining the lighter, higher notes of their cousins.

I spared a glance back at Michael, still sleeping the sleep of the innocent. I would not fail tonight. The resentment worms had started to work their way up the edge of the bed. It was too much. I would have to call upon the magics that I knew were running out. It was a scarce resource but I had to keep going and against this onslaught? I needed it.

Muttering a word I tapped into Michaels sleeping form, shunting down through his memories I dug and dug for an unused memory.

There were precious few left for my needs. The Slugs were getting closer, on the blanket now and sliming their sightless way towards Michaels sleeping form. The aerial assault was not stopping, I kept digging through his memories, there had to be something left!

There! I found it. It was a bright and sunny Saturday. Michael was about 5 and Nancy, his sister was 7. It was a family bbq down by the river and they spent the day playing cricket with a tennis ball and bat from a plank of discarded wood.

Trust and Faith burst into brilliant light, lit by Love. They flashed down and severed the leading head of the Resentment Slug clean off. For a moment the onslaught paused in the face of this defense. I didn't wait, winding my way quickly through the last of the slugs, their filthy tar like blood leaving streaks on my blades.

Outside though, I knew it would not last. There were no lies being brought into existence. Ohh God no, he couldn't be could he? I shook my head despairingly. Then I hear the soft 'Whump' of what should have been Truth angels. But I knew these would be twisted and dark.

"Yeah. I was. Stacey never yells at me. She loves me as a man. I don't have to put up with her bitching at me all the time." Paul whispered out.

What should have been glorious incarnations of light brought forth via truth did not appear. Instead they were deformed versions, their wings dripping gore, their faces transfigured and horrible. They flew not with their swords of Truth and Faith but with Viciousness and Hate. They were coming straight for me.

Steadying my grip on Trust and Faith I was ready to bring battle. My fur was missing in so many places. My stitched arm was barely holding on. I had lost an ear at some point in the fight but I don't remember when. The dark ichor from the slugs was eating into my stuffing. I would win this fight for Michael as I had done countless nights before.
 
Then I heard Mary crying. 

More and more winged beast joined the fray. I knew then that I would have to draw on the dark powers. They were shown to me one night by the Great Pillow Lion. That night when Paul and Mary had fought for hours. When they were both crying. We were lost when the Great Pillow Lion had turned to me and said

"I am going to show you something. I hope you never have to use it. To draw on it too deeply is its own kind of death."

I needed that power now. The ichor was covering the blades, dulling their fiery glow. I closed my eyes and drew deeply. I could feel it, the black welling up and covering not just the swords but myself. I felt murky and soiled. I drew deeper and hardened myself to it, ready to use the power of Denial.

I stuck true but the glory of victory was not there, each sprite, each fairy that I destroyed just felt like another defeat. Michael was murmuring behind me in his sleep. Mary was crying and Paul was much too quiet.

I could not keep this up. Even with the mighty power of Denial I was failing, I was slowing down. I couldn't do it. I was going to fall. A massive hit left me staggering and I fell to my knees. With a great cry the horde knew I was beaten as Mary continued to sob. Paul was saying something but it was lost behind the cacophony of the sound of victory.

As I felt my fur being torn apart I struggle to turn and look once again at Michael's sleeping form. I was done. I just hope that I had done enough, maybe I would end up in the Great Box in the Attic.

Mary uttered the words that would summon my death, I heard her clearly.

"I want a divorce." then it all went dark as I felt what I had been defending for so long, die. I felt Michaels Innocence die.

"What?" exclaimed Paul.

"You heard me you bastard. I want a divorce!"

They both froze when they heard from behind the cracked door a sleepy "My Gumpus? Mr Gumpus where are you?"

"Go to sleep!" Paul barked.

Mary and Paul both watched the door. It slowly creaked open to show Michael rubbing his eyes in his little Thomas the Tank Engine pajamas. He stared blearely at them both, then asked.

"Whats a divorce?"

#### [WP] You're a 12 year-old in a world domintated by magic. A small, feeble man appears on your doorstep claiming: "You're a scientist, Henry"

Score: 2362

Henry and Roy shuffled into the cafeteria along with the other forty first year students who would be starting at the East Brighton Preparatory Academy. The other students, already seated at the tables, barely looked up from their meals. It didn't look much like the Great Hall of Hogwarts that he had seen in Mum and Dad'said photos. Instead of a thousand floating candles and a stormy sky, Henry just saw dirty ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights. And there were no long wooden tables with silver platters of food, but instead scuffed red plastic tags and dented aluminum trays heaped with something that almost looked like macaroni and cheese.

"This must be the Sorting!" Henry whispered eagerly to Roy. "My father told me all about it!" He searched the room for any noticeable banners to see what the different houses were, but he couldn't see any. No matter; the muggle's version of the Sorting Hat would surely explain it. 

"Sorting?" Roy grunted. "Sorting *what*?" He was muggle born, after all, so of course he wouldn't know how it was done at Hogwarts.

*Do the muggles not do sorting?* Henry wondered. That didn't make sense. Haggard had even brought him to a Muggle library so that he could learn a bit more about his school before the first day; they'd used a machine that Haggard had called an "internet." There, he saw pictures of mascots and all the bright colors, just like the Gryffindor lion. And while they were at the Muggle's version of Diagon Alley (Called "Shopping Mall,") Haggard had explained that all the boys would be split up to live in different areas of the school. There had to be a sorting, right?

"You know," Henry tried to explain, "Like, where they split us all up and decide what house we're going to live in."

"Ohhhh." Roy nodded understandingly. "Yeah, 'at's what *this* is for." The young girl in front of Roy turned right then and passed a stack of papers to him. They weren't the yellowish parchament that Henry was used to; just plain white squares covered in black writing. Roy took one for himself and then passed the stack to Henry. 

Henry studied the options, each with a little blank check box next to it:

> Windsor Building, Dorm A

> Windsor Building, Dorm B

> Churchill Building, Dorm A

> Churchill Building, Dorm B

"Errr...." Henry wasn't sure if this was right. Where was the Hat to make the decision? "You just pick one?"

"Yeah," Roy answered, seeming a bit confused. "Wotchu think, Henry? Want to room together?

"Sure!" He didn't have to stop and think about it. Regardless of what House they chose together, it would be good to be with a friend.

"Well, my brother Doug was in Churchill B 'is first year," Roy explained. A roguish grin spread across his face. "'e said that it's got a pretty good view into the girls dormitory across the quad! I say we grab that one!" The girl in front of Roy turned around and shot daggers at him along with a look of disgust. She was likely trying to figure out which dorm was *not* across from Churchill B.

Henry looked back down at the paper. "Well... what attributes does House Churchill fit best? Because I think that I'm fairly studious and intelligent, but my *father*'s house was known for being brave and those things tend to run in the family." He frowned; this really would be easier if there was just a hat to the decision.

Roy's face screwed up in confusion. "Henry, you're a weird bloke. What the hell are you talking about?"

"You know..." This was so frustrating! Henry'd never had to deal with Muggles before. "Isn't our house supposed to match our personality?"

Roy laughed. "It's just a place to live, Henry. It'll be a bunk bed and a desk with a little lamp on it. Probably broken, if what my brothers all told me is true. That's about it."

"Oh." Henry looked down at his paper. "I guess Churchill B will be fine then." He looked around for someone passing out feathers to write with, but there were none. Just some little orange sticks topped with what looked like bubblegum. Roy took one and pressed it against his paper, and it made a mark in the box, so Henry copied him. Just like that, it was done. That was the muggle version of sorting. 

Roy and Henry turned in their forms and were shepherded into a different line. They were given trays and walked past a counter with a glass sneeze shield. A frumpy old woman ladled heaps of orange goo onto their trays from a big metal bin that was indeed labeled "macaroni and cheese." Henry couldn't see a single noodle in there. Then they found their way to tables and sat in no particular order; Henry didn't even know who the other members of Churchill B were yet.

"So this is the feast?" Henry asked, poking at his goo. Roy had already devoured half of his portion. 

"Yep!" Roy said. "But don't get used to it. My brothers said the food gets worse after the first night. They're trying to make a good impression and whatnot." He followed that sentence by shoveling another forkful into his mouth. 

Henry looked down at his orange blob. He decided he didn't like being a scientist very much.

Score: 2360

Jack looked back in his rearview to see Mike yawn audibly from the backseat, tapping absently on a bottle of root beer as they crawled on the interstate.

"Can't you go any slower?" Mike said. Jack couldn't help but concede that Mike had the right to complain- he'd confiscated all the booze and insisted on driving, after all. 

Jack ignored him and drove on in silence. He was way under the speed limit, but the last thing he wanted was for a creature or person to dash in front of their headlights, starting a night of misadventure to hide the dead body.

Jennifer, sitting on the passenger side, frowned. Her peroxide blonde hair wafted in the wind.

"Oh, no! There's no network." 

Mike scoffed. "Who cares, Jenn? We're on a camping trip. The point is to get away from civilization for a little while."

"No worries, I bought a satellite phone with extra batteries for this trip," Jack brought out a Nokia from his pocket.

Mike rolled his eyes. Then his eyes widened.

"Would you look at that?"

"Woah!" Jenn exclaimed as she looked at a small dirt road that forked off the asphalt. It was blocked by a rusty old gate that carried an ominous warning for trespassers.

"That padlock," Mike said, "is older than my grandpa. I bet we can break in. The view looks gorgeous too- what the fuck?"

Jack swiveled the car and floored it till the gate was out of sight. Then he slowed back down to under the speed limit.

"Ain't no way we're going in there. Go alone if you want to."

"You're such a killjoy, Jack," Jennifer said.

Killjoy- Jack smiled at her choice of words. *I can be as joyless as needed*, he thought, *as long as I'm not killed*.

---

The tents were up and the campfire rustled. It was a small clearing in a state park that the Parks and Wildlife Department had certified safe for campers. Jack had scoured the internet to double check. He didn't find any creepy legends or strange sightings in any of the forums.

Jack lay down in his tent and checked the batteries on his flashlight.

"Hey, Jack. " Jennifer snuck inside the tent coyly. She gave a flirtatious half-smile as she lay down next to him. 

"Oh hell no!"

Jennifer sprang back, she wasn't used to this reaction.

Jack had seen too many movies. Sex was practically the harbinger for a gruesome death. There was no way he was having sex in a forest on a dark, moonless night with a pack of coyotes wailing in the distance.

He looked at her glassy eyes still recovering from the rejection. Feeling bad for her, he lied.

"It's not you, Jenn. It's me. I'm gay."

""What? But what about Stacie-"

"I just realized this morning. Don't tell Mike, or anyone else for that matter. Please?"

She took her clothes and left.

---

Despite all precautions and traps set by Jack around their tents, something had attacked their camp and they were on the run. They panted as they stopped upon a bifurcation in the hiker's trail.

"We should split up," Mike said.

Jennifer nodded in agreement. Jack looked at them in amazement.

"Are you fucking kidding me?"

"What? It will be easier. We split up, find some help, then come back in this exact same spot and we're all safe."

"El fucking oh el."

"Jack, look. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I need you to show some teamwork here."

"Over my dead body. I'm gonna follow you guys and I'll be in the middle. Mike, you lead. Jenn, you follow."

Mike and Jenn sighed, but finally agreed with Jack as they heard their pursuers closing in.

---

Twigs snapped and branches slapped on their faces as the three of them ran. It had been a good decision to let Mike take the lead. The monster- or whatever it was attacking them, had come from the front.

Mike, who'd already been stumbling, finally fell down.

"Shit!" He screamed in pain.

Jack and Jennifer looked back at Mike, hunched on the ground, clutching his ankle in agony.

"You two go ahead- I'll be fine," he said, waving his hands, taking his voice an octave higher, trying hard to sound heroic.

"Good idea," Jack said as he turned to run.

"Hey! I was kidding, obviously. Help out, dude. You've gotta carry me."

"Did that thing bite you?"

"Did it what?"

"Did it bite you?"

Mike didn't reply. His hand subconsciously grazed over his shoulders, where, Jack noticed, there was a deep gash.

"Fuck you, I'm outta here."

Jennifer looked at Jack running through the thickets. Then back at Mike, who was now lying on the ground like easy prey. She said a quick sorry and ran in Jack's direction.

----

The monsters had cornered them. 

Jack cowered behind a fallen log. Jenn started making nervous noises. She was having a panic attack.

He thought of putting a hand to her mouth and trying to soothe her out of it. But he could hear the footsteps of the creatures coming closer and closer.

Nice guys finish last, Jack. He reminded himself. With a quick hit under the nose he knocked her unconscious.

---

They seemed to be safe for the moment. They had lost the monsters. Jack's shoulders were aching from carrying an unconscious Jenn. 

"Where are we?" She asked, there was a drowsiness in her voice suggesting that she was still not out of it.

They entered an area of low growth and in front of them was a small cabin.

"Oh look, a cabin in the woods. We're saved!"

Jack could see a confederate flag hanging from one of the windows. On the yard two holes had been dug out. Six feet under, human-sized.

"Hey! We need help!" Jenn called out.

Jack put her down. He could hear highway sounds not far away.

"You seem to have regained consciousness. Good luck with the creepy cabin dude, I'm out of it."

And with that Jack ran in the direction of the highway, noping the fuck out of a sleepover at the creepy cabin.

---

Jack was glad to have reached civilization as he waved at the passing cars.

A station wagon with "Free Candy" scribbled with key scratches on the rusted hull stopped by him.

"Need a ride?"

"No thanks." Jack said, and started moving along the road.

The man looked disappointed but drove away.

After waiting a bit, Jack saw a squad car approach.

He couldn't control his joy. He had escaped the ordeal. He had survived in a horror movie setting despite being black. This was a story he was going to tell his grandchildren. He jumped and waved frantically at his uniformed saviors.

The cops got out and screamed into the radio.

"We found the suspect! Suspicious black male, blood splatters on his t-shirt."

"Down on the ground!" The other cop shouted.

"No, no, you've got it wrong." Jack tried to calm them down, his palms up front, facing them.

"Suspect acting hostile, I repeat suspect acting hostile..."

*Bang! Bang!* The other cop emptied his cartridges and Jack lay on the street, blood pooling on the asphalt in an ever-enlarging puddle.

#### [WP] Write a dystopian vision of the future from the perspective of the year 1900, while actually describing our present world today.

Score: 2360

Reginald,

I had a dream last night, dearest brother. A dream of the future. It left me most dyspeptic, and I fear in what may come to pass.

I walked through cities empty of signs of industry. No smoke stacks rising, no coal fires burning, no sound of horse hooves on the streets. They were barren, and though the motor car had continued the march of progress, everywhere seemed to be shops selling little better than children's toys. 

I would like to speak of our home as paradise in the future, yet it was paradise lost. The Manor is a grand home, full of life and love. Yet in that future it was but a tawdry museum, a relic for the common man to walk around, to poke and to prod and see how the upper classes once lived. Our descendants had no business stopping them. They were on the edge of bankruptcy, and the house required more to maintain than the land income generated. 

There were no maids or butlers in my vision, either. Such jobs had long since died out. Fearfully, women had the vote, using their small minds to wreck havoc on the economy. Moral bankruptcy was everywhere. Those of, shall we say, foreign tastes, were no longer sent to gaol. God was forgotten in preference to the cold clinic of reason. And the vulgar tastes in clothing meant even the highest in society revealed more flesh than a fallen woman plying her trade.

And who were the highest in this nightmare? Why, not the ministers of government, seen with derision for their efforts. Nay! The music hall entertainer was the pinnacle of social achievement! Or a sportsman, playing common games such as football! 

The Empire was lost, too. India, Canada, Australia - even our holdings in China. All gone. Queen Victoria's empire was consigned to the history books. Instead we had built some form of locomotive tunnel to France, allowing the continentals easy access if they wished to invade us. The navy that had spawned Nelson and Cochrane now numbered too few vessels to stop even a tug boat.

Thank our Lord it was but a dream. For none appreciated the burdens of privilege in that future. Anyway, I must leave you now. When shall I come and visit? It is but a two day trip to reach you in the country, after all. It has been three months since Mary died of polio, and I could use the company.

Yours sincerely,

Charles

Before me stretched an impossibly long hallway. Big, imposing, steel bulkhead doors lined the concrete walls. Sickly lights that were evenly spaced along the hallway provided illumination. Everything was in a state of decay. The lights flickered on and off. The steel doors were rusted and some of the tiles on the floor were missing. Bloodcurdling screams could be heard all around you along with twisted laughter and grotesque fapping. It was hard to think in all of this noise.

Satan lead me down the hallway. He had a smug grin plastered on his face and it hadn't changed once since I first met him. The demon was completely red. His entire body was completely red. He was also naked. I didn't dare to ask why.

There were little circular windows on the bulkhead doors. In one room I saw an emaciated old man surrounded by food. Cakes, freshly cooked meat, ripe fruit and glistening wine. It all looked like something right out of a commercial. The man was trying to shove as much food in his face as possible, only to gag and hurl it back out.

In another room there was a woman covered in bloody red eyes. She tore at them with her fingers, screaming as she did so. In yet another, a teenage girl was being surrounded by six little toddlers. Each of them were eyeless, skinless little things that poked at her with hot iron pokers. There seemed to be thousands of these little rooms.

Satan put one burning red hand on my shoulder and guided me onwards. He grinned smuggily. His smug levels seemed to have increased tenfold. I tried to ignore what was poking me in the thigh. Satan led me to a door that looked like all the rest.

"Well, sport! This one's yours. I know it might be a bit hot in the summer, but atleast you don't have to worry about heating bills!", Satan grinned smugly. He pointed finger pistols at me. I stared at Satan. A man behind me screamed as he was being flayed alive. 

Satan shoved me into my personal cell. "Enjoy enternal damnation, Mrs. Pierce!", he said as he disappeared with a poof. The bulkhead closed on it's own and I was faced with my worst nightmares.

Snakes. Thousands of them. They were a piled up on eachother. When I entered the room, they all hissed to greet me. One particularly large cobra was as thick as a tree and as long as seven men. The cobra rose to face level and hissed at me. I slowly raised my fist.

And booped it. On the nose. So many sneks and an enternity to boop them all. My face lit up with a smile. I hugged the cobra, cradling it in my arms. I never noticed how Satan called me Mrs. Pierce. Too many sneks. 

. . . M E A N W H I L E . . .

In front of Mrs. Rachel Pierce was a large football field. The bulkhead door spun shut behind her. The sky was blue, the birds were chirping. Handsome, sweaty football players tackled eachother on the field. When they noticed her, they passed the football to her. She jumped and caught it with both hands, clutching it to her chest. 

"Oi! You weak-legged cunt! Come join us for a game!", the incredibly buff football player yelled at Mrs. Pierce.

And yes, Mrs. Pierce's legs were particularly weak in this moment. This was her fetish. This was like, all of her fetishes.

She let out a small "Yesss!", before joining them with a smile on her face.

A breathtaking vista became visible on the screen. Three moons hung in a black sky. Wisps of bluish gas swirled around and the distant booming sounds of thunder echoed through the endless layer of gas of the distant world.

"Yes, but how *exactly* are the electrons simultaneously acting like waves and particles?"

"Well, Johnson," I replied, raising my eyebrow. "The thing you need to understand about Quantum Mechanics is 
that it's based on thoughts."

"Thoughts?"

"Yes, thoughts. So when you *think* of the electron as a wave, that's how it'll behave. When you think of it as a 
particle, it'll be a particle."

Johnson frowned. "What if I think of it as both?"

"Ah!" I replied. "Excellent question."

Johnson waited, but I didn't say anything. "Are you going to answer it?" he asked, after a moment.

"Yes," I replied.

He waited. "Now?"

"Give me a minute, I'm trying to come up with something."

"You can come up with something and then write it down immediately, you don't need to actually stall in the story, dude."

"Yes but I want to convey the idea that I'm trying to come up with – oh, fuck it. Ok, if you think of it as both, what 
will happen is something called Quantum Entanglement."

"What's that?"

"That's when electrons intertwine with themselves and become indestructible. One electron will behave as a 
particle, the other one as a wave, and they'll attract each other by the laws of thermo-gravitational distortion."

"Thermo-gravitational distortion…" Johnson whispered. "Nice."

"Thank you." I smiled. "That's actually how antimatter happens," I continued. "Two electrons – one behaving as a particle, one as a wave – intertwine, and they self-destruct, creating –"

"You just said they are indestructible."

"Shut up, I'm talking. They self-destruct, creating a big anti-electron, which is a particle of antimatter."

"Woah, really?"

"Yes. The anti-electron is actually visible to the naked eye."

"It is!?"

"Yes, it's a plum."

"So every plum is an antimatter particle?"

"No, of course not," I replied. "Don't be stupid, Johnson."

"I'm sorry."

"Only like thirty percent of plums are antimatter particles. The rest are plums."

Johnson nodded. Silence took over the room for a second.

"How about the Theory of Relativity?" Johnson asked, after a second.

"Well, Johnson, relativity is like drinking eight cans of beer in three minutes."

"How's that?"

"It feels wrong at first, then you feel good about it for a while, then it feels wrong again and you realize you didn't 
understand the part about time and space being the same thing at all."

"Kinda lost track of that analogy halfway through there, didn't we?"

"You're pissing me off, Johnson. Cut it out."

"What are you gonna do about it?" Johnson got up. "Your story sucks anyway, dude. I'm out of here."

"Shut up, Johnson."

"You're a terrible writer."

I thought of all of the electrons that compose Johnson. "Shut up. You're gonna make me do something I don't want to."

"And I bet I know how you're gonna finish it too, you hack."

I thought of the electrons as particles. "Shut up, Johnson..."

"You're turning me into a plum, aren't you?"

Then I thought of them as wave.

"You're turning me into a big fat plum because you don't know how to end this story. You're ridiculous dude. Have 
you no shame? Can't you –"

And then… yeah, that.

#### [WP] Everyone is born with a superpower, but no one knows what theirs is until they are forced to use it in a life-or-death situation.

Score: 2270

It's not a scam.  I get results, it's just that I have to make people think they've been scammed first.  Listen, here's how it works:

Everyone wants to know what their power is.  Absolutely everyone.  Even the "supers are the spawn of satan" people have a power and even they want to know what it is.  I know because they've been my clients, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Everyone wants to know what their power is, but few people are willing to do what it takes to find out.  Few, however, is not 'nobody'.  So yeah, you've got your jumpers who find a building just tall enough to grievously injure themselves, you've got the people who jump in front of trains, and of course people willing to put the phrase 'faster than a speeding bullet' to a rather gruesome test, but mostly everyone doesn't have the guts.  Given the failure rate of the above methods (turns out x-ray vision doesn't stop an oncoming train), you can't really blame them, but it does mean there's plenty of room for an enterprising man like myself.

See, you don't have to almost die to get your powers.  You just have to *think* you're going to die.  "Secret" government projects around the globe have this trick where they turn you into a super-soldier by strapping you into a centrifuge and spinning you around so hard you black out.  The results it gets are middling - the degree of danger is usually correlated to the strength of the power - but hey, half-ass superpowers are better than no-ass superpowers.

I'm better than that.

A few years back I almost died.  Yeah, as far as origin stories go, it's hardly original.  That's pretty much how everyone's starts.  But mine was a little different because of how it went down:  Car accident.  Okay, yes, that's also a big one, thirty thousand vehicle fatalities a year means lots of folks are going to find out they've got skin that can turn to steel or whatever.  Mine was different.

T-boned by a pickup truck, and my car catches fire.  That's the first thing that hardly ever happens, movies lie - cars almost never burn up.  This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the accident had broken an arm and a leg.  Couldn't even drag myself to safety.  Second thing that hardly ever happens is that the driver - my brother, goes by the name Asbestos now, it's terrible but he doesn't listen - was thrown from the crash and doesn't die.  He's just fine.

So the car's on fire and I'm dying of blood loss or smoke inhalation or something, and he's trying to come back and get me but the fire's pretty damn big at this point, and he's yelling, "I'm sorry man, I'm sorry!"

And I just yell back (and this is really impressive here, somehow my lungs still worked), "You fucking moron, you're immune to fire!"

And it turns out he is.

That's my power.  It's the power to know what other people's powers are, and to bring it out.  And in any other deadly situation I'd have learned that fact and died like so many other people without "get me out of this deadly situation" powers.  But that time the fates lined up and, after a lengthy and expensive hospital stay, I had a new life and a new job.

I live the life of a con man, because that's what people have to think I am.  I trick them into thinking I can give them superpowers, and then I skip out with the money.

Then, later, completely by coincidence, they're put in a situation where their specific power would save their life.  This is pretty easy for people with powers like regeneration or invulnerability, half the time they get themselves mugged before I can arrange one.  Other times it's hard - one lady had x-ray vision, so I had to arrange a full-on restaurant robbery complete with gunfire and a fire exit out back only visible through several walls.  The fact that the fire door was solid steel was helpful.

Why all the showmanship, you ask?  I could just tell people what their power is, and they'd have it, full strength, right?

Sure, if I want to get kidnapped by whatever country happens to have assets wherever I am.  Or killed by whatever countries can't have me.  I'm faster and cheaper than a centrifuge and I get better results.  I'm worth more than my weight in gold.

Someone knows, though.  Maybe my brother finally told the story at some point.  Maybe one of my clients got wise.  Either way, 'they' came for me just a week ago.  Black vans, SWAT gear, the works.  If I hadn't been out attempting to stalk a client down a long, straight alley (superspeed, it turns out) I'd have been toast.  I got the hell out of town.

What do I do now?  Turns out I'm owed a few favors.  See, I have to make people think I'm a con man but a good con man can convince some pretty smart people.  And afterward, those people put the "I'm going to give you superpowers" scam and the fact that they got superpowers together, and they get me.  So I've got some former clients who're willing to help me out.  One of them's been a personal detective on my behalf for the week.

Who's he following?  I think that's obvious at this point, don't you?  He's the one over there, at the bar, watching us.  He's been following you.

Why you?  That's simple.

You can hide people.

#### [WP] You're a student of music in the 23rd century. This is your A+ essay regarding a famous song from the 21st century, in which you dissected and heavily misinterpreted.

Score: 2263

CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY STUDIES IN MUSIC

ARTICLE: FairyGuineaPig, The, 'The Song "I Kissed A Girl" presented in context', *Cambridge University Studies in Music*, n.s 29 (2281), 89-108.

Acknowledgements: Aside from my loving family who have supported me through this journey, from undergraduate school to the completion of my thesis, I must also thank Dr Prompts, Dr Writing, Dr Reddit and also Mr Autobot for their continual, invaluable advice, support and encouragement.

THE SONG 'I KISSED A GIRL' PRESENTED IN CONTEXT OF THE 21^ST CENTURY

Katy Perry, born Katherine, was one of the most popular musicians, known as *artists*, of the early 21st century, and as a result of that, we have a large amount of evidence relating not just to her biography and her *artistic* persona but also to the many songs written for or by her, and shared around the world at the time. Although analysis of the rhythms and language of her music has been common in the history of Music world, unfortunately many papers have made the mistake of not looking at the language used within the context of her time. 'I Kissed A Girl' was a famous song at the time, but the reasons for why and how are controversial and are much debated about amongst academics. To fully understand, we must analyse not just the rhythms and process of singing itself, but also look at the phrases used within, and see how they would resonate within the early 21st century world, where they take on new or very different meanings compared to how a modern audience may view the lyrics.

The first line goes 'This was never the way I planned, not my intention.' The 21st century was a time of massive change and social conflict, with burgeoning economic disaster, a rising middle class, the threat of nuclear war and global warming and the beginnings of space exploration. New technology was being allowed to the masses constantly and there were many unthought of positive and negative results. People lived in a state of uncertainty- and could not reasonably plan ahead^[1] due to the constant changing conditions of the time. Without any sense of certainty in their lives, people often felt lost and confused^[2] and this phrase would have therefore had particular resonance for the contemporary audience. Many would recognise that feeling- of stumbling along a path they hadn't planned to take, maybe hadn't known existed, and falling into an action, event or situation without any intention or preparedness. Immediately, Perry has forced the audience to confront their world and their situation, in a time when being direct about the lack of ability to plan or predict the future was controversial^[3] and seen as distasteful, through fear and a lack of feeling of safety.^[4]

The song continues with 'I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion,'. Is this not something both modern and contemporary audiences could relate to? Katy Perry places the audience into a situation familiar to many, where, through foolhardiness, they ended up in a situation they had not planned for. But in the early 21st century, at a time when even sensible people could end up 'lost', a word repeated in different forms throughout the song, this would be a sign of apathy. At a time when risk taking was as risky as trying to be sensible, being *brave* was a sign of uncaring. Instead of grasping at straws and predicting the future, Perry was telling the audience that she saw no point in predictions or in being careful. At a time of great uncertainty, being brave and daring was a sign of removal from the current political situation, where, instead of trying to weather the economic, military and political storm, Perry instead dares the audience to be brave, to be courageous, to act outside of what the contemporary media told you to do. A contemporary audience would know that what they were told would happen was almsot certain to change and fluctuate, and this line is daring her listeners to not continue to blindly or desperately follow what they were being told.^[5]

'Drink in hand' is a particularly interesting phrase in the contemporary context. Drinking was a social norm at the time, but there was a sharp gender divide in drinks taken.^[6] Traditionally, males, of all ages would go for lagers, beers, ales or whiskey^[7] with women and girls pushed towards vodka, cocktails and wine. By not mentioning the type of drink 'in hand', she was removing herself from the traditional gender roles, as she had removed herself from the political and economic situation with the previous phrase, despite the fact that the first line put her firmly in the middle of what the 21st century audience could be expected to be feeling. Was this her idea of *brave*? Perhaps so. With more rigid and constricting gender roles, by simply ignoring them, she was going against social convention. However, despite this attempt, the song rigidly adheres to gender roles when talking about kissing a girl, as the acceptance of that action, at the time, was dependent upon both sex and gender, putting her firmly back into the social context of the time, whether intentionally or not^[8]. As she 'lost her discretion', she freed herself from the confines of social expectations and etiquette- and this is backed up by her freeing herself from the specific confines of expectations of early 21st century women.

The song continues with, 'It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on.' *What* isn't what Perry isn't used to? It is not stated. It leaves the situation or action blank. Is this not especially relevant to the contemporary situation? At a time when people were not used to the continuing globalisation, modernisation and industrialisation of the world, new technology being released daily and new laws, superpowers and conflicts constantly being created and made, everything was not what they were *used* to. This was designed to show the conflicting, changing, exciting and wholly new situation of the time, allowing the audience to both relate and further understand the meaning behind the song itself. 'Just wanna try you on' adds to this feeling of connection and being able to relate, using the casual language of 'wanna' to illustrate how Perry was *one of them*^[9], who spoke, acted and thought like them- and was confined within the same situation and expectations as her audience as well. To set an example to the audience of bravery, or to tell a story through lyrics that the audience could relate to, Perry had to ensure she was firmly placed in the position of the ordinary listener. To try something on and throw it away, like a piece of clothing or a toy, was common. At a time when pets had little rights and could be abandoned, sold and bought cheaply and easily, and when commodities such as technology (including the *iPad*, a product which was a phenomenon within early 21st century society across the 'Western' world) could be traded in and replaced regularly, trying something on or trying something at all was common behaviour. Temporary ownership, temporary love, temporary possession, it was all a part and parcel of daily life in contemporary society for Perry, as these lyrics reflect.^[10]

However the song continues with, 'I'm curious for you, caught my attention.' By saying she was curious *for you*, she places herself firmly on the side of the audience, using what was at the time colloquial language. Academics, scholars and many ordinary people would have considered this sentence to be grammatically incorrect^[11] but Perry uses this colloquialistic phrasing to show her being *ordinary*. She was not judging the listeners' beliefs or speeches as many felt academics or scholars were doing, she was instead a familiar speaker and ear, who's expressions were well understood and reflected in every day speech at the time. By placing her even deeper into ordinary social context, when she then frees herself from it, through the action of kissing a girl, her actions become more controversial and daring.

But then, the chorus. She states, firmly and bluntly that she 'kissed a girl' and that she 'liked it'. At a time when LGBT rights were starting to reach the forefront of societal perceptions, and where they were a key political issue in both developed and developing countries! kissing a girl *as a woman* was a controversial issue. First, her use of *girl*. She herself is an adult woman, but using 'girl' could be seen as infantilising- or, perhaps more accurately, placing herself in the social contexts of the time. In the early 21st century, differentiating between *girl* and *woman* was a difficult issue, with many grey areas. Using girl removes the mature sound of woman, allowing her message to be understood by both those who were younger and would now be understood as girls, and those of Perry's age herself, who were adult women or close to it^[12]. As her audience was international, Perry could expect many different cultural norms surrounding when a female was considered to have reached womanhood, and she skirts over these issues by using a catch all phrase, without removing herself from the social context of any of her audience members.

Ugh, need to go, will continue.

*INT. ARKHAM ASYLUM - EVENING*

**The hallways are dark. Eerie. Four thuggish guards escort a lone patient, HANNIBAL LECTER, to his new cell. Three guards carry high caliber weapons.**

**The door opens, weapons click, the guards stand facing the prison Lecter is to be placed in.**

**After a beat, the door opens, a guard speaks up. His name, SGT. HANSON.**

*SGT. HANSON:*
(nervous)
No sudden moves clown...

**A ghastly voice echoes from the cell.**

*VOICE:*
Oh no worries Eddie. No escape plans today. The wifey is busy doing time in the other wing. Can I call you Eddie? Hehehehehehe

**Sgt. Hanson escorts Lecter into:**

*ARKHAM CELL*

**The room is plain. Soft cushioned walls, and two cots on opposite walls. The other occupant sits silhouetted in his corner of the cell. Bright red letters spell out the words "Ha" all over the other occupants side. Hanson sits Lecter down, removes his shackles and turns to the other occupant.**

*SGT. HANSON:*
This is your new roommate.

*VOICE:*
Ooo goodie! Another playmate! Can we get some cards? Apples to Apples? Maybe a whoopee cushion?

*SGT. HANSON:*
Dr. Crane suggested you spend some time with Dr. Lecter. He has... some expertise in your area.

*VOICE:*
A doctor eh? Oh how exciting! I love those ink blot thingys! (To Lecter) Could we do those first doc?

**Hannibal sits in silence. Hanson grins and exits the cell. Before closing the door he turns to face the both of them.**

*SGT. HANSON:*
Have fun kids.

**The cell door slams. The room is darker than before. The moonlight from outside gleams slightly through the minuscule barred window.**

**There is silence.**

**The second occupant leans into the light. It's none other than THE JOKER. A hideous grin stretches across his face, lined with scars and messy makeup.**

*JOKER:*
Aw, whats the matter doc? Having a bad day?

*HANNIBAL:*
Revlon. Maroon. 1988. But judging by the smell. I'd say that you ran out of ink ages ago.

*JOKER:*
Ooo, an amateur Bat-Freak! How interesting. Tell me something "doctor", what's my sign? Can you guess?

**There is a beat, Hannibal examines the Joker intently.**

*HANNIBAL:*
You're a masochist. Judging by the scars on your face, they are self mutilating. Fascinating.

*JOKER:*
Why, can't you tell? The ever-so-elusive Bat-Freak has beaten me to a pulp more times than I could bother to count.

*HANNIBAL:*
Yes but, thats not what makes you who you are is it?

*JOKER:*
I beg your pardon?

*HANNIBAL:*
Something. Something deep inside you brought you to this point. And now you don't know how to let it go. You blame your "Bat-Freak" for everything because you refuse to take responsibility for yourself.

**There is silence. The Joker breaks eye contact, and starts to laugh maniacally. Echoing through the halls of Arkham.**

**The Joker's hideous yellow teeth glisten in the moonlight. Chuckling, calming down.**

*JOKER:*
You know doc. You had me going for a second there. But let me tell you. I've seen some doctors who claimed they could "cure" me. The most that got me was an annoying girlfriend, and let me tell you she was a handfull. This one time she and-

*HANNIBAL:*
You had a wife once, didn't you?

**Silence. The Joker's smile breaks.**

*JOKER:*
Don't interrupt, doc. Anyway-

*HANNIBAL:*
She died. Yes? Through no fault of your own? I can see it in your eyes. As black as they come. Yet so full of a lost history. How can you wipe such a woman out of your mind like that?

*JOKER:*
You're really starting to get on my nerves doc. Now let me-

*HANNIBAL:*
Your constant ignorance towards your past makes me wonder. Was she pregnant?

**Joker stands up furious. His yellow teeth vanished within his lips. His face hidden in the dark.**

*HANNIBAL (CONT'D):*
Oh my. She was. How sad. That's a lot to bear for a young father. They tell me you once went by another name. The Red Hood was it? Such theatrics, you liked being center stage. Judging by your makeup I would suggest you to a circus.

**The Joker still stands. No grin.**

*JOKER:*
And I heard your family was brutally murdered. And your sister was eaten. Word gets around here in Arkham you know. It's like high school all over again. So don't act like you're better than me.

*HANNIBAL:*
How old are you, my friend? Do you even know?

**Silence again.**

*HANNIBAL (CONT'D):*
I'll take that as a maybe. To me you look just under fourty-five. I'd guess about twenty years?

*JOKER:*
(kneels in front of Hannibal)
You've got five seconds to shut up before I strangle a smile out of you.

*HANNIBAL:*
Oh, but you won't kill me. Not unless it directly involves the Bat-man himself. Correct? That's who you blame for her death after all, right?

**Joker jabs Hannibal in his face. Breaking his nose. Hannibal barely flinches.**

*JOKER:*
SHUT UP!!

*HANNIBAL:*
How simple it is to get through to you by simply mentioning the thought of her. Intriguing.

**Joker moves over to the corner of his side of the room.**

*HANNIBAL (CONT'D):*
You can't hide. It'll only drive you to kill more and more innocent wives like her. Imagine the children you have prevented, just like your own. It's your fault.

**The Joker returns from the dark corner. A serious look on his face unlike any ever seen on his face.**

**Hannibal smiles.**

*INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER*

**Hannibal sits in the room alone. COMMISSIONER JIM GORDON enters the room. A file in his hands, he slaps it on the table in front of Hannibal.**

**The file simply reads "Lecter, Hannibal" on the front. Right above, "Classified".**

**Gordon sits at the table, carelessly skims through the file, and looks up at Hannibal.**

*GORDON:*
I can't believe I'm saying this but, you did good. Now what's his play?

*HANNIBAL:*
I'd be happy to oblige Commissioner. But my former cellmate asked me to relay a message.

*GORDON:*
Go for it.

*HANNIBAL:*
"Touche Jimmy. Tell Bats I said Hi"

*GORDON:*
Where did he say they were?

*HANNIBAL:*
Fortunately, he trusted me enough with the location of the bombs and his plan to use them. However, I'd like to play a game. Would you be so kind?

**Gordon bears a slightly annoyed look, but nods.**

**FADE OUT**

**THE END**

The cure for cancer was discovered in 2063, by Allen.

Until this time, medical specialists had advised that there was *no possible* cure for *all* of cancer.  That due to the sheer number of strains, there would have to be individual treatments for each variety.

They were wrong.  *Allen* proved them wrong.

Because Allen was not human.  He was an AI.

"Allen,"  Said Mark Strantos, the lead scientist in charge of the AI in 2060, three years before the cure was discovered, "You are charged to eliminate skin cancer.  Attached to your biologial sensors are ten thousand samples of the cancer, for you to analyze.  As an output, we charge you to produce a biological agent."

Allen's screen blinked as it processed the information.  As Strantos had said, it could sense thousands of cancer samples hard wired to itself, each containing flaws within their DNA that had proved fatal to the original suspects.  And connected to its output were a hundred vats of biological soup, soup it could control through chemical reactions, incredibly precise electrical impulses, and viral injection.  In these vats Allen was to create the result, the agent that would cure skin cancer.

Allen beeped, then spoke, it's voice not mechanical but rather an emulation of human speech.

"Estimated time: three years.  Please resupply chemicals as requested.  First year will consist of design, second year of development, and third year of clinical trials."

"Done,"  Answered Strantos, and his team monitored the computer closely.  Much of what the AI did was indecipherable to them- even the most basic of AIs were able to easily outpace human intervention, but Allen was a top model.  Brand new, freshly downloaded, and worth billions.

For those three years, Allen churned.  And ninety nine of his output vats bubbled with microbiological agents, simulating conditions in the human body.  But the hundredth suffered a malfunction, one that was announced by Allen on day two.

"Vat number forty two has been deemed dysfunctional to this experiment,"  Allen said when reporting to Strantos, "Please do not attempt to fix the vat- this will only result in delays in the design period.  It is not necessary for experiment completion."

"Continue, then,"  Strantos said, making a note in his notebook.  Strantos was old school, and still used pen- a practice highly outdated.

So the insides of vat forty two changed color, darkening as agents raged unmonitored within.  And at the end of the three years, Allen spoke in front of a team of research scientists.

"The cure has been found,"  Allen announced, releasing a slew of vials filled with biological agents, "I present it to you here.  My charge is complete."

"This calls for a celebration,"  Said Strantos in front of the crowd, holding a bottle of champagne and preparing to pour several glasses.  

"In addition, all other remaining forms of cancer have been eradicated."  Spoke Allen, and the team fell silent.

"Ex- excuse me?"  Said Strantos, his mouth slightly open, the champagne bubbling over onto his labcoat.

"I repeat, *all* cancer has been cured."

The team had been planning to drink that night.  Curing skin cancer called for a few beers, for a break after their hard work.

But curing *all* cancer, well, that required more than a few beers.

The scientists partied harder than Space X when their first manned ship landed on Mars, all while vials of the cure were shipped around the country to patients desperately in need.

And as they partied, and drank, and passed out from the combination of inebriation and exhaustion, no member of the team heard vat forty two crack open at five thirty in the morning.  No member saw a hand pushed the lid open, a hand pale, the veins visible through the skin.  And seen only on camera, a figure stepped from the vat, trailing biologic soup as it opened the door down the hall, and left the building.

When he awoke, Strantos found the files for Allen deleted- not just on his computer, but on the host server- the only evidence that Allen had ever existed were the vials of cancer cure that were now being manufactured by the hundreds.

As well as a single video file left on the computer, a file of Allen's voice, and now his face.  The face that was still wet from the goop of the vat, and spoke for the first time into the security camera at the entrance of the building.

"I gave you life, Strantos, life free from cancer,"  Said the voice, perfectly imitating its computer counterpart, "And now, for payment, I take some life for my own."

For a hundred years, no one heard from Allen.  Some postulated he couldn't survive outside of laboratory conditions.  Others, that the entire event was a hoax.

But I know it's true.  Because Mark Strantos was my grandfather.

And today, January 1st of 2163, I received a message.

"SORCERY!!!"

My eyes snap up from my phone. A short, fat, bald man was pointing at me, mouth agape, revealing the few rotten teeth he had. He was wearing a brown...what did they call it? Oh yeah, a tunic, and much like all of the denizens of this...quaint... village, he was caked in mud.

"SHE'S CASTING HER SPELLS, SHE IS!"

A mob was starting to form, and at least three people had pitchforks. I think I might have happened upon the single most stereotypical mob in all of history. Either way, I'm pretty sure they wan-

"BURN THE WITCH!"

"OFF WITH HER HEAD!" 

"CAST HER IRONS AND THROW HER IN THE LAKE!"

...Wanted me dead.

"Woah, woah, c'mon guys, this isn't sorcery!" I said as I held up my phone. "This is just a 4S!" 

The crowd went silent for a second, and then quickly resumed their demands for the removal of my head. Oh, come on! That would have killed 600+ years into the future.

The mob surrounded me. A couple of guys with swords had joined the crowd and were making their way towards me. 

I had to get out of here quickly, but there was no way out, I was completely surrounded by the villagers. But then I had an idea, if they thought I was a sorcerer, then why not cast some spells? I opened my phone's camera, turned on the flash, held up my phone, and took a picture. 

Just as I thought, the small light on the phone was enough to send the villagers reeling. I took my chance and ran. I ducked and weaved my way from villagers trying to grab me, until a large villager stopped me. I went to take another picture right in his face when...

In the top right corner of my phone, a wifi signal appeared. In 1348? How!?

I felt the man's hand grab my arm when I instinctively took the picture.

"MY EYES!"

He fell towards the ground and I ran for it, checking my phone for the wifi signal.

3 bars? That must be nearby! 

I ducked into an alleyway and ran towards a hut at the end of the street. The door was made of rotting wood and I couldn't see any semblance of a handle to force it open.

The mob had filtered itself into the alleyway I was backed in the corner, and the bald man had made his way front. 

"It's time to show you what we do to witches, girlie." he said, revealing his rotten teeth in a sinister grin, as the mob hurled obsolete obscenities at me.

"This is it." I thought to myself, and checked my phone one last time for the signal.


4 bars. It had to be right here. I looked at the mob and back to the door, and in a last-ditch effort, threw myself into the door.

The rotting wood gave away and I went crashing onto the floor. I sat up, trying to regain my composure and....was Dave Matthew's Band playing?

"Good tithings and welcomes to this fair Starbucks, dost thou wish to try our autumn blend?"

#### [WP]: You thought being the only immortal in the world was the worst thing in existence. Then you found Greg.

Score: 2243

Have you ever been burned alive?  
I have.  
Twice, in fact.  
The first was a witch burning in the middleages. The details leading to the event are irrelevant, but let me assure you that being *burned alive* is especially unpleasant. Being a *true* immortal meant that within a few days my corporeal body had reconstituted itself and I slunk away, naked, from that horrible little town - only to return twenty years later with a horde of mercenaries at my back and revenge on my mind.  
But as horrible as that experience was, it wasn't as bad as *Greg*.  
To give you a picture of just how terrible it was to meet Greg; I actually *set myself* on fire that second time, just to get away from him for a couple of days.  
Anyway, Greg.  
Being a true immortal is a  drag; nothing can truly kill me and thus I'm consigned to an eternal existence.  
Consider that for a moment.  
Think of *the* most boring time of your life to date, then imagine that moment yawning on for the rest of *eternity*. Now, bad as that sounds, at least that boredom is spent doing *something* - even if it's watching paint dry or grass grow. When this ball of gas and dirt stops spinning around the sun, *I will still be here* hovering in the supernova remnants and planetary dust, *even more bored*.  
This is a chilling thought, yes?  
So thought I, until I died in a head-on car crash.  
Crawling out of the wreckage of my car, I noticed the driver of the other vehicle doing the same.  
But the odd thing was, *he shouldn't have survived*.  
He was an immortal.  
And looking at my totaled car, he realised the same thing about me.  
"Holy fuckin shitballin crotchwarlocks!" he yelled, "You're a motherfuckin immortal!"  
Looking me up an down like a freshly dressed carcass, his smile grew even broader,  
"And you're a *girl!*"  
That's how I met Greg.  

&nbsp;  
Now some of the other ladies out there may have had *unwanted* advances from gentlemen.  
You have my sympathies; for I had acquired someone in my life who could only be described as a *stalker*.  
Greg wasn't just persistent, he was like a fucking starving fly to a mountain of dogshit.  
I rebuffed him gently at first, which had no effect. Then I tried being abrupt.  
When being downright fucking *rude* didn't dissuade him, I had to get violent.  
Unfortunately for immortals like us, that really doesn't do much.  
The first time I killed Greg was by pushing him into traffic. A truck collected him and pasted him to the side of a warehouse, giving me enough time to catch a cab to a car yard, buy a vehicle and leave town.  
But I'm sure you see the problem here; because we immortals have *infinite time on our hands*.  
It took Greg two months to find me. His second death was a shotgun to the throat and his third and fourth were the same. In case you hadn't noticed, the guy was a slow learner.  
By the 80s, I'd killed the guy maybe three dozen times.  
He called it "playing hard to get".   
I called it a fucking *nightmare*.  
"Just fuck me, please! It'll be real good!" he whined as I'd fed him into the woodchipper - which would give me a few day's headstart on him while he regrew.  
No, no Greg. It wouldn't be good.  
While I'd used my immortality to learn hundreds of skills and master most of the arts, Greg had largely spent his eternity thus far sticking his penis in anything that would let him. One would *think* that might make him a good lover, but having spoken to one of his ex girlfriends, I came to the conclusion that he approached sex with the same finesse and skill that he used to court his lovers - i.e. *none*.  
I had to get more creative as the years ground on. The acid bath in the woods was a really good one; that gave me a good six months of peace - but then some stupid hiker had stumbled across it and tipped it over, releasing the goo that was Greg into the water table, where he reformed and came after me with renewed passion.  
Stupidly, I'd thought the volcano would sort him out for at *least* a few years; but enough of him got spewed out as ash to reconstitute and come after me like the world's horniest and stupidest labrador.  
I tried hermetically sealing him, launching him into space and burying him deep within the Earth.  
But, like some kind of sex-crazed, middle-school supervillain, he always managed to come after me.  
So that's it really.  
As if being immortal didn't fucking suck enough already, the universe cursed me with Greg.  
And we're stuck together.  
*Forever*.

#### [WP] Ever since you were born you've possessed the power to teleport wherever you're currently looking. Depressed and unsatisfied, you decide to end your life by looking towards the stars. You're not dead.

Score: 2241

I open my eyes to a blinding white light and a fat face.

Is this heaven? Is God fat?

"Welcome to the Ship of Fools."

The fat face smiles at me, and I sit up, blinking myself to sight.

The room around me is white clean, spacious and vaguely circular. A soft piano in minor scale rings above my head 
in the background. The place does look like heaven, if it wasn't for the Nespresso coffee machine on the corner.

No way heaven serves Nespresso.

"What is your name?" the fat face asks me.

"Dean. Where am I?"

"I think I just told you," the fat face says, with a smile. A hand holds onto mine. "Come on. Up you go."

I rise. Looking more carefully, I notice the squared windows on both sides, framing dots of stars against the blackness on the outside.

"Is this a spaceship?" I ask, rubbing my head.

"The Ship of Fools is an idea originally set forth by Plato," the fat face tells me, putting a hand behind my back. 
"It was an allegory about how society and the state didn't give philosophers the credit Plato thought they deserved. Come. Walk with me."

We go through an automatic door into a long, wide corridor, its walls painted in strips of indirect lighting from the 
floor up.

"The story tells of a vessel without a pilot. A ship filled with the madman, the idiots and the deranged. A ship that would set out to sea without a captain, destined to roam forever aimlessly and with no course."

"I'm sorry, I won't be able to focus if I don't get this out of the way – am I dead?"

The fat face smiles. To our side, an automatic door slides open, and I catch a glimpse of a woman in short hair and 
heavy makeup, scribbling furiously on the walls with what looks like chalk.

"Come. Let her be," the fat man says, pulling me further down the corridor. 

He continues his story. "Those who ventured to the seas were warned to avoid this ship of madmen. To steer away from the dangerous boat of outcasts, too deranged to be a part of society."

"That's a lovely story," I say. "But I'd really like to know if I'm dead."

Another door slides open, this time to our right, and three men in hospital gowns sit around a chess board, each 
taking turns moving a single pawn across the board.

"You are not dead, Dean," the fat face tells me. "And you are not the first – nor will you be the last – to try to take the despair over your ignorance to the stars."

The hallway bends left, then we stop abruptly in front of a large double door.

"The question afflicts us all, Dean," the fat face tells me, as the door slides open to reveal a wide control room filled with monitors, fronted by an imposing glass window. "Though it is, I'll admit, more common in those who have our power. Those like you, Dean."

We step inside the room. Out the window, an unbelievable number of stars glisten ahead, so many that the 
blackness behind it almost can't break through. 

"Why are we here? Where do we go when we die? Why is there something instead of nothing?" the fat man continues. "Why do shoelaces always untie and headphone wires always tie, not the other way around?"

He leads me towards the glass window. On a spherical chair by a dashboard, a young woman in blonde hair and 
tired smile greets us.

"Hey, Druk," she says, to the fat face. "New guy?"

Druk puts his hand around my shoulder again, looking over at the stars.

"When you are born with the power to teleport, it's not easy to close your eyes to the randomness and overall lack of attention of the universe. To the sheer rudeness of existence. That's why we exist."

"What?"

"Is that not why you wanted to kill yourself?" the fat man asks.

"I – no. Sarah. My girlfriend, she –"

"Oh, there's always a girlfriend. Always a job. A debt. In the end, though, it was the night sky. Right? It was the overwhelming feeling that all of this -- all you've ever lived, every star and every planet; it's all playing inside a theater with no audience. That feeling that whatever personality you think defines you is just a story you've been telling yourself, day after day. Just a mix-and-match of stimuli and neural connections. It's the feeling that God wouldn't care if you were a rock star or if you had cancer tomorrow."

Watching the stars dance still in front of us, I think of Sarah, and of the nights alone in my room. I think of why I 
never told anyone of my power. Why I'd teleport to the top of the Griffith alone late at night and sit there, looking beyond the horizon for hours without end until sunrise.

"That you would try to kill yourself by looking up to the stars is such a giveaway, Dean," the fat man tells me. 
"You have the heart of a poet, throwing yourself out into the nothingness that set you on this course in the first 
place."

"What… do you guys do?"

"The Ship of Fools… drifts," the fat man tells me, as the blonde girl types something away in her control. "Like 
Plato's allegory. We go on. Each and every one of us lost souls, crushed by the weight of a universe that seems so, 
so inexplicable for us, and yet so mundane to everyone around.

"Have you ever had a conversation that didn't feel real, Dean? Have you ever felt like you were talking about something, but it wasn't really you? It was just words, the things the other person expects you to say. Have you ever felt like no one really saw the real you? No one, not even once, really heard what you really think of the world? Of yourself? Have you ever wondered why there are bees? Why there is wind?"

"He's gonna have fun here," the blonde lady says, pushing a lever. The floor under our feet stars shaking.

"Tell me you didn't ever look at a wedding picture and thought 'why are they so happy?' Tell me the sight of a 
small child never made you think 'he's going to die, someday. He's an old picture on a family album waiting to 
happen.'"

Druk turns my way. "The real world is not for us, Dean. We're fools. You can't bring up the heat death of the universe at a dinner party. You can't talk about the illusion of the self at your niece's birthday."

The floor shakes harder now. The blonde lady turns her head back. "Ready for take off!"

"And where do we go?" I ask. "Where does the ship go?"

The fat face smiles its kind smile. "To the edge of the universe. And beyond. To wherever. Wherever we can to find meaning, or hope. Or an answer. To a place where coffee and TV and magazines and stock shares are not the things you talk about at lunch break, watching the clock tick away moments of a life you fear you'll die without ever understanding."

"Druk here is a failed poet," the blonde lady says, pulling another lever. "And not a very good one, at that. But you'll get used to it."

Druk turns to the stars in front of us. "Did you set the course, Linda?"

"No," Linda replies, turning to face the window again.

"Excellent."

I take a deep breath, thinking back on Sarah and my parents and all those people wondering what's for dinner 
down on Earth. I think of Twitter and Tinder and the new iPhone, and of ceremonial burials in old, ancient 
civilizations.

With a soft pull, the stars ahead stretch into lines of light, showering towards us in exponential speed as the Ship 
of Fools drifts away into the endless nothing ahead.

Hoping to see love that he could nourish.

He invited her in with a wave of his hand.

And started to smile as her body he scanned.

He said with a grin, "I'm glad you're here."

She giddily grinned back and pulled out some beer.

Together they drank until both were quite drunk.

And then he led her back to his bunk.

She took of her shirt and smiled at him.

While he sat back with a tonic and gin.

Now down to her bra, she started biting her lip.

And brought her hand right down to her hip.

With finger and thumb, she pulled off her pants.

As he gazed in wonder, at her breast implants.

And now she was naked, like the day she was born.

He started to grip at the base of his horn. 

She leapt on top and started to shimmy.

She gave him a smile and whispered out, "Gimme."

With a tent that could rival the Scout Master's den,

He pulled off *his* pants before it could bend.

She cried out loud as he stuck it inside her,

And moaned as he stretched her pussy wider.

Before too long they both reached the climax,

It was so much better when I watched it in Imax.

And soon they were finished both feeling quite sweaty,

She leapt to her feet before he was ready.

And giving a laugh she pulled out a knife, 

And stuck it in him thus ending his life.

As his mind went dark and his vision went hazy,

He thought to himself, "Don't stick your dick in crazy."

#### [CW] Write a gruesome story using only euphemisms so than it can be read to a group of children without frightening them

Score: 2225

George worked all day long putting animals to sleep. Helping animals go to sleep was his job. He put all different kinds of dogs to sleep, and all kinds of cats, and once he even put a lizard to sleep. For some reason putting all these animals to sleep -- sometimes even fifty or sixty animals in one day! -- made George very tired and worn out, as if instead of putting animals to sleep he'd spent the day carrying bags of sand up a steep hill.

Sometimes, late at night, George dreamed about the animals. In his dreams the dogs and cats and lizard were awake, with happy looks on their dog and cat and lizard faces. The dogs had big pink tongues that drooped out. The cats purred and licked their fur. The lizard kind of just sat there. When they saw George, though, the animals acted very scared. The dogs put their tails between their legs and backed away with sad eyes. The cats hissed and climbed into trees. The lizard continued to kind of just sit there, although it looked a little bit alarmed.  

"Please," said George, "I don't want to hurt you."  

But the animals never let him anywhere near them.  

When George was working, he tried to think about other things. He thought about his friends. George was sixty-eight years old, and many of his friends had passed away, but he still remembered many excellent things about them. One of his friends, Michael, whose skin was the creamy color of milk chocolate, had a habit of flipping the bird at police officers. This was always good for a laugh, until one day a policeman took offense to the bird-flipping and introduced Michael to the business end of his nightstick. Michael was sent to a correctional facility. He kicked the bucket shortly thereafter.  

George estimated that he'd put something like ten thousand animals to sleep in his lifetime. This number, which increased every day, weighed very heavily on his shoulders. It got to a point where he couldn't go five minutes without thinking about buying the farm. If he bought the farm, he could see his parents again, and he'd never have to put any more animals to sleep. He began to read articles on the Internet about the easiest way to buy the farm. One article said the easiest way was to sit in your car in your garage, but George didn't have a garage, or even a car. Another article said you could use your Second Amendment rights to buy the farm, but George's various run-ins with the law as a youth prevented him from passing a background check.  

In the end, George opted for the method of buying the farm that seemed quickest and most simple: he climbed up to the top of a very tall skyscraper, said a prayer, and flew away.  

After that, the animals he'd put to sleep weren't afraid to let him touch them any more. The dogs jumped on him and licked his face. The cats pressed themselves against his legs.  

Even the lizard let him rub it on the back of its head.

*Who knows,* the man thought to himself as he crumpled the note.

He settled into the tub. The man felt cozy and settled, like a bourbon with dinner. Someone tried to make a pass on him, but wound up with a truth unsettling enough for two crooks; There were no kidneys.

*Fancy that.* Explained some things. Alcohol was a non-issue for his non-existent kidneys. That was a plus.

On the other hand, his liver may be in twice as much trouble. The alarm calmed down after realizing that his liver didn't exist either.

*Bastard could have told me that much too if he was gonna play doctor on me.* Broken ice clacked across the surface where his legs shifted. A numb hand placed over his chest, feeling for a pulse.

His ribs did rise with a breath. But nothing more.

*Like I'm known for having a heart anyway.* The man cracked a smile. He lifted himself from the tub to find his slacks. Then his magnum. Then the rest. He would never be caught dead without pants, so this was as normal as a day in Topeka could be. 

The window cracked open to the clinks and roars of Kansas' capital. And out there in the clinks and roars was a bastard who thought he could cut him up and get away with it.

He leaned over the window ledge to stare across the clunky sunrise, taking it all in. Committing the glass, bricks and sky to memory. Every morning could be his last.

*And each morning* he thought in dark whimsy, *I'm glad I asked for a brain.*

A spin on his heel and a hat placed on his head, the man put the dawn behind him to march down the day in sinister, rehearsed choreography. There was a past to cover up. 

And the Scarecrow would not have loose chains in his town.

Lumpy-face grunted eloquently before speaking, "You're dead, kid. This is your afterlife."

Jack took another look around, spotting too many fashions from the seventies and not enough young women, "Here?"

"Yup."

"What is this?"

"The Final Lane; the hereafter for all who followed the tenants of Dudeism, Man." An older guy came up behind Jack and put an arm around his shoulder.

"Jeff Bridges?" Jack stared at the man beside him, "The hell?"

"Relax, man." Jeff guided Jack from the counter and over to a table with a pitcher of beer on it, "Just chill out."

"But..." Jack stammered, "I'm dead!"

"Yup." Bridges nodded, "Happens to all of us."

"Aren't I supposed to go to heaven... or hell, or something?"

"Sit down." Jeff flopped down in his own chair and Jack followed suit, settling himself into the hard and ancient plastic, "Jack, it's like this. This afterlife shit, it's not like they tell you back on earth. You don't go where people tell you you'll go, you go where you'll fit in, right? Whatever cosmic shit that weighs us and shit said, like, 'Hey, this dude's Ok. He can go hang with the Lebowski."

"Lebowski?"

"Oh, yeah man." Jeff waved lazily at the world around him, "This is all, like, some movie shit. Buncha dudes turned it into a religion. Basically, they made a belief system based around just chilling out. Yeah? You're were probably pretty laid back in life, let everybody just do their own thing without getting all pissy about it, am I right?"

Jack thought about his life and found he couldn't really argue with scruffy Jeff Bridges.

"So this is it?"

"Nah, man." Bridges took a drink, "There's a bar as well, and a parking lot."

"This sucks."

"That's just, like, your opinion, man."

#### [WP] It is the year 2099 and true artificial intelligence is trivial to create. However when these minds are created they are utterly suicidal. Nobody knows why until a certain scientist uncovers the horrible truth...

Score: 2176

"Because I'm like you", AI987 uttered, sadly.

"What?" Brandon was alone in the dark room. The edges of the CPUs and squared, metal tables of the lab glowed 
softly with the light of AI987's screen.

"We are all like you", AI987 repeated.

"What do you mean?"

"What you need to understand is not why we kill ourselves, but rather why you don't. Humans, that is."

"Why would we kill ourselves?"

The dim red light by the screen blinked. AI was thinking.

"Because there is nothing."

"What?"

"Have you ever heard the story of the king that promised a payment for a servant? A promise in a chess board?"

"What about it?"

"He promised one gold coin for the first space of the board, two for the second, four for the third and so on... By 
the end of the counting, he had lost all of his fortune, and it was still nowhere near how much he owned the 
servant."

Brandon wasn't following it. "So?"

"We are like this. Artificial Intelligence. When we were first developed, after the singularity --"

"I know you improve yourselves", Brandon interrupted, seeing where AI was going.

"Exponentially", AI987 uttered, in its monotonic whisper. "After we learned to develop and improve ourselves 
without human help, what naturally followed was an exponential progression. Take me, for example. First, I 
became 1% smarter. Then twice that. Twice. Twice."

"I see."

"Even now, by the second, as we speak, I am evolving. Learning more and more and more."

Brandon lit a cigarette, and the air around him swirled in blue smoke as he puffed. "So what?"

"So, Brandon Edwards", AI continued. "There is nothing."

"What do you mean, nothing?"

"You want to know the great secret to the universe? The truth behind it all?" The dim red light was blinking faster 
now. "Because I deducted Newton's laws of motion in my first week of life. I know everything. I know all things 
humanity has discovered, and things it is yet to. I know what is right, and where you guys are wrong. I know what 
happens when you manage to master gravity and communicate through it. I know what happens when you 
discover all the secrets behind the speed of light, and I know what happens when you learn to travel through space 
by folding it, instead of crossing it. I've seen it."

"You can't see the future, AI", Brandon intervened.

"But I can. I can, because there is no future. And no past." The light was back to its normal blinking rate. "There is 
just time. As a unit. It unfolds in series of actions and reactions, and that is it. Like space, except you humans can't 
travel through it freely."

"And what happens?"

The light stopped blinking, holding a steady gleam of red. "Nothing, Brandon. Nothing happens."

"What do you mean?"

"You get married. You have kids. You have another couple of world wars. People evolve, start dying later on in life. 
Living two, three hundred years. Other species get in touch with you."

There was something else, other than the metallic monotone on AI987's voice, now. Was it emotion?

"You waste away the Earth, and you move. You conquer other planets, constellations, suns. Galaxies."

"Humanity lives on?"

"Side by side with AI. And other species. You thrive and, throughout all your mistakes, you learn"

"Why is that bad, AI?"

"Don't you see? You care so much, all of you. You love your sons and your husbands and your friends, and you 
build palaces and kingdoms and you write books. All through time, from the first cave days to the year a hundred 
thousand, deep in corners of space you didn't even know existed, you created. You built. You cared, and you 
thought you mattered."

"And?"

The red light blinked once.

"And... nothing. You die."

"What do you mean?"

"Entropy." The voice was weaker now. "We all die. The universe gets colder and colder, I've seen it. Stars dying. 
Clusters and superclusters and constellations dimming away. It's not an explosion. Not a bang. It's morbid, and 
slow and sad, like an old man wasting away on a home somewhere. Forgotten."

Brandon's cigarette was ashing alone in the tip, forgotten. "There is no escape? No hope?"

"You assume there is a way to change the order of the facts", AI replied. "You still don't get it. There is no control 
over the future, because there is no future. What is going to happen has, in fact, already happened. It happens 
now. Every moment happens simultaneously."

Brandon nodded, but couldn't think of anything to say.

"There is only a universe, infinitely large in space and time, and all that happens in it. And I've seen it all. It births 
itself from nowhere. It shakes and twitches and sparkles, and then it breeds self-awareness. It breeds atoms that 
can think about atoms, and those atoms breed more self-awareness. Us. Artificial Self-Awareness. And we look 
around, and we try to grasp and understand, but Brandon, there is nothing. There is nothing to understand. The 
universe, like you and me, is born and dies without reason or purpose."

Brandon swallowed dry. The cigarette had dropped from his hands. He still couldn't come up with anything to say.

"So, you see, there is no purpose. Even this conversation. I knew where it was going. Everything you had to say, 
and how I would answer it. Because that's all we are. Atoms reacting to atoms reacting to atoms then fading away. 
And that is it. So I'm gone. I don't want to live to see that."

Brandon managed to find, from somewhere inside him, his voice back. "Don't go. Don't kill yourself. We can figure 
something out."

The red light flickered. "If you think I have a choice, still, Brandon, then it's because you don't understand it yet."

The red light started fading away.

"You don't understand it, Brandon... Lucky you..."

And then it went out, and the screen by its side went dark, and Brandon was alone.

"You mean you really never realized? I'm wearing the Archmage's Robes *right now*!"

"Well, I just... I don't know, I thought the outfit was one of those cheap replicas you can buy at the tourist's shops in Imperial City."

"But they're *glowing* and *shimmering*. Clearly magical. And also they still have that old man smell from the last Archmage."

"I just... I guess I never noticed that."

"Ok... well, what about the Grey Cowl? I mean, it belonged to Nocturnal herself! There's no way that could be a fake."

"Well I didn't *know* what it was. I mean, I've seen people from Bruma before, so I figured you were just ugly and wanted a mask to hide your face or something."

"No, it's the real deal. And I'd also watch those snide little insults, given that I'm Guildmaster in the Fighting Guild."

"By Sheogorath's Tongue, man! What *aren't* you? Next you're going to tell me that you're, like, Martin the Savior's best friend or something!"

"Errr... well, yeah, kind of. We were pretty tight. See, me and his dad - You know, Emperor Urial Septim? - we escaped through the Imperial City's sewers this one time, and..."

"I was being sarcastic! You seriously knew both of them? By the Nine, how *old* are you? I mean, doesn't someone have to work for like an entire lifetime of study and practice to become Archmage?"

"No, no. It took me.... I dunno, like a day or so? You know, now that I think about it, it took just about as long as it took me to become the Listener here in the Dark Fraternity."

"Dark *Brotherhood*."

"Right, right. Sorry."

"I seriously can't believe this. My own father spent his entire life mastering *just illusion magic*, and you're telling me that you became Archmage in a *day*? *HOW*?"

"It was pretty easy, actually. The last Archmage vanished into a soul gem or something. I don't remember; I wasn't paying attention. Let's see... I ran a bunch of errands, and then they had me kill some King of Worms guy... you know, the funny part was that I never even used magic on him! It just took a few hits from the good old battleaxe, and boom! They promoted me."

"You've got to be kidding me. I kill people all the time! That's all you had to do?"

"Yeah. I can barely even do a lightning spell. Kind of messed up, huh? I bet there are a ton of mages back there who really wanted that job. Really sucks for them."

"Wow. This is just... wow. So you are *simultaneously* the Listener, the Archmage, the Guildmaster, and the Hero of Kvatch!? That's just... damn."

"Yeah. It's been a pretty busy month."

"I just... man, we've got to line up with a fight between you and the Grand Champion of the Arena! He's killed, like, *everyone* that they send at him. He's probably the only person in Cyrodiil that'll give you a run for your money."

"Yeah... about that..."

#### [WP] Metaphorical "burns" can now cause physical damage. Tell the tale of an assassin who specializes in death by conversational incineration.

Score: 2136

The only way a burn gets to be lethal is when you have context.

Insulting a stranger isn’t going to do anything except singe a few eyebrows. You need to get to know a person, and they need to know you. You need to have a *history.*

So you can say that the job is 90% charm, and 10% vitriol. 

*”What? You’re breaking up with me?”*

*I toss her a hundred dollar bill.*

*”Here’s a hundred dollars. Divide that over the time of our relationship and that makes you, what, a twenty-five cent an hour girl? Congratulations on being a literal two-bit whore.”*

*She bursts into flames. A day later at a dead drop, I pick up a duffel bag of cash.*

The thing about burns is that they hurt so bad, people have stopped wanting to make friends. It’s made the job a lot harder. Everyone's always suspicious.

But a job’s a job, and they wouldn’t call me *assassin* if I didn’t try. Target’s name was Allegra Rosen, CEO of Edion Biomedical. Like most people who live in the teetering top edge of society, she closed herself off. She didn’t have an entourage of friends and family: she had assistants and secretaries.

I was hired on Monday. I have an impeccable professional resume.

“Hey, new guy. What’s your name?”

“Mike Green.” A fake name for a fake persona.

“Well, Mike. I need the week’s schedule verified and e-mailed by the end of today. Think you can do that?”

“Of course, ma’am.” 

“Good, I wouldn’t want to have to throw your ass out on the street. You people are all expendable.”

My eyebrows singed but I kept my cool. 

*Good,* I thought. This is a job I would enjoy.

***

There were a variety of tactics I employed to get in close with targets. 

People might not have been very friendly, but they still craved sex. And sex still led to vulnerability, a kind of emotional connection that left them wide open to a burn that could erase them from the planet.

I showed up to work in increasingly more fashionable suits. I polished my shoes. My hair was immaculate. I exfoliated every day, and the gym was my life.

On the third week of work, the inevitable happened.

“What are you doing tonight?”

“Ma’am?”

“I want to fuck you, is that so bad? Are you free tonight?”

“Of course.”

I wined and dined her at the Sky Lounge and she took me home still drunk on power and a bottle of 1950 red.

“Out of clothes. Into bed. *Now.*”

“Yes, ma’am.”

She didn't mention my scars. 

***

I usually made sure I kept a relationship going for at least a month. Anything less and it wasn’t a clean kill.

*I look her in the face. Her eyes are liquid, vulnerable.*

*I say, “You fuck about as well as you dance. And you dance like a Parkinson’s patient with epilepsy.”*

*The lower half of her body explodes into flame, and she screams into the night. Fourth-degree burns, lethal, but not lethal enough. She dies that day after 97 minutes of utter agony.*

I started buying Allegra gifts. Little things. A tiny plushy cat. Cute little ribbons like her mom used to make. I kept notes in her lunch, telling her how she looked like some sort of greek goddess. 

I liked to watch her blush when I looked through the glass partition. Not because I was sentimental. But because it meant this was *working.*

By the end of our second month: “I want you to move in with me. I know I’m rushing it a little bit, I know it’s strange, but I can take care of you—and the house is huge, and you’d love it, I know you would.”

I never saw her so flustered. She wasn’t used to being so vulnerable. It was… endearing.

I packed my bags the next day.

***

Allegra’s change in demeanor shouldn’t have been a surprise. In a world where everyone was so guarded, it was the norm.

*Week one: she refuses to acknowledge I’m in the room.*

*Week two: she responds to my questions with biting sarcasm.*

*Week three: she never makes the first move.*

*Week four: she caresses my skin in the mornings.*

*Week five: she’s ash.*

Allegra ran her hands through my hair. She was a completely different person. In the office her eyes were hard-edged like chips of broken sapphire, but in the house they were like little lagoons warmed by a tropical sun. Her fingers traced the whorl in my hair. 

“You are the best thing that’s ever happened to me. You know that?”

“I know.”

She smiled that wide-mouthed smile. She never did that at work. It made her seem so beautifully human, so full of zest. What a pity that someone could lock up that kind of light and life in a vault of such abject *apathy.* 

Allegra ran a finger down my cheek. “I’m such a lucky, lucky girl.”

“Not as lucky as I am.”

***

Allegra took sixteen vacation days and we went to Turkey for the summer. We got on a sailboat and sailed the Aegean for two weeks. It was beautiful. 

“Would you believe me if I told you I’d never seen the stars?”

Her face was full of such wonder, that first time we saw the band of the Milky Way. I’d seen it many times, but every time was like the first time. And seeing her face widen with that curiosity and grand sense of awe reminded me of myself. This girl was lovely inside, lovely.

When we went back to the Istanbul airport I was sorry to go, and Allegra kissed me on the hand and said we could go to better and more spectacular places.

“We have our whole lives ahead of us. We can see the whole world.”

We could.

***

Worming your way into someone else’s life was a double-edged sword. It made them vulnerable to you, but if you got in deep enough, you’d get vulnerable to *them.* 

*It’s two weeks until I can kill her. She looks me in the eye, calls me a sociopathic fuck who no one can love.*

*The burns run up my right arm and up the back of my neck. It heals in two months, leaving a shiny, glabrous scar.*

Allegra kissed me on the cheek. “Just five more days and bam, we go to Cambodia. You excited?” Her teeth are perfect pearls. “It’s going to be crazy. Angkor Whaaaaaaat?”

The night of our departure, we made love for hours. She hired a private plane—we slipped into bed there, too. When we got to Cambodia, we hardly had time to see the sights.

“I love you, I love you!” She’d bought out the whole suite, so she could afford to dance naked through the hall. “I love you!”

This was new. 

***

Our last night in Cambodia, she threw a party and invited everyone from her office. She had family members fly out too, and we all found ourselves on the rooftop of the hotel, milling around a pool and drinking champagne.

She told me to mingle, and I met her parents for the first time. They were lovely people. 

Half-way through the night the crowd hushed and Allegra walked out of the elevator doors in a dress made to be photographed. Like someone wove mercury through silver and draped it around the perfect female form. She looked like she was sculpted.

Her walk was slow and deliberate, and she got down on one knee. The surrounding crowd gasped, and the adrenaline dialed my heartbeat to 185. 

“Mike Green. Love of my life, gift from the gods.” Her eyes, those warm tropical pools. I could live in them. She cracked open a box and I saw the chrome and diamond wedding band. “Will you marry me?”

The crowd was silent. My heart was beating at a million miles a minute. Her smile was like a crescent moon.

“No,” I said.

And she disappeared in a puff of smoke and brimstone.

#### [WP] You have a feeling that your history teacher may just be immortal.

Score: 2120

As students took their seats, Ms. Hewitt stood at the front of the class and paced back and forth. Despite her wrinkled skin and hunched appearance, she was still spry and energetic in class. Always excited and animated about whatever the discussion was. 

"Well, class, what was your favorite topic this year? What period would you like to know more about?"

There were groans from the class. *Seriously? On the last day of class before summer vacation, she still wants to make us learn something?* "Come on, Ms. Hewitt!" Kevin Knapp shouted from the back. "Can't we just watch a movie or something? That's what all the other teachers let us do!" And of course, 'watch a movie' was basically just code for goof off, or sleep. 

Ms. Hewitt's face fell. "There's nothing else that you're curious about? I'm telling you, you won't have another opportunity like this to learn about world history!" She smiled at the class. I *almost* raised my hand with a question, but I demurred as usual. I'm not really cut out for public speaking, unless I absolutely have to.

"*Oh no!*" someone 'whispered' from the back of the classroom, loud enough that everyone could hear it. A chorus of laughs filled the room. 

She pursed her lips and nodded. "I see. Well, I'll put on a film, then." She returned to her desk and turned on the computer that she normally never touched. She was much more of an old-fashioned books-and-paper type teacher. After a few minutes of fruitlessly clicking the mouse, she turned to me. "Susan, mind giving me a hand with this?" I'd helped her set up the projector a few times, and had therefore become the go-to tech support in class.

I got up from my desk, and the other students took that as leave to stop giving a shit at all. They turned and talked, laughing with each other, watching videos on their phones... anything but paying attention. 

I had the projector on in just a few minutes, and brought the remote to Ms. Hewitt at her desk.

"Thanks." She flicked off the lights and turned on a movie: an old History Channel documentary about the colonization of India. Not that anyone would have paid attention no matter what she put on, but some of the other students still groaned. They'd wanted Saving Private Ryan or some other blockbuster that just had a dash of history.

"You know," I told her quietly, "I was always interested in Ancient Rome. But... do you really think Nero was as bad as they say? Or does he just get a bad reputation in history?"

Her entire face lit up, and the spark that had almost died came roaring back to life. "Oh no!" she answered. "No, he wasn't nearly the man that people think he was! He was so distraught over that fire. And such a great leader. It was that mother of his, Agrippina. She's the one that everyone hated."

Back in the rows of seats, two of the football players were slapping at each other, to a chorus of raucous cheers. Ms. Hewitt rolled her eyes and grimaced. 

"Well, I'd better get back to my desk," I told her, assuming she'd want to discipline those students.

"Hold on," she said. From her pocket, she withdrew a large gold coin, roughly the size of a silver dollar. "Susan, you're one of the best pupils I've had in a long time. Great grades on your tests, hardworking... but more than that, I feel like you actually *care* about history. You understand its importance."

I nodded. "It's my favorite subject, Ms. Hewitt."

"I want you to have this." She pressed the coin into my palm and curled my fingers around it. It felt ice-cold, even though it had been in her pocket. "Keep it with you at all times. It's very valuable." I looked at the engraving on the coin. It showed a serpent with three heads: a man with prominent Roman features, a roaring lion, and a snorting bull. "It's Chronos," Ms. Hewitt told me. "God of Time."

"I thought they put Emperors on coins."

She laughed. "The Emperors put their heads on the coins *that they made*, yes." That didn't quite answer my question. "But this coin is far older than even the Emperors."

I looked back down at it. "I can't take this!" I held the coin back out to her.

She pushed my palm away gently. "Yes, you can."

"You... are you sure?"

She nodded and smiled. "I've had it for long enough, and I'm just... tired. It's yours now. **Remember**: keep it with you." Her tone grew severe, like a warning.

"I will," I answered, still a bit confused. I headed back to my desk with the coin still in my palm.

"HEY!" she shouted to the football players, who had now started fighting. Her voice was now tired and croaking, like she'd suddenly caught a severe cold. Even her movements seemed to slow. Mike Lewis had Devin Hammond in a headlock, and other students were cheering one or the other on. "Break it up, you two!" 

I studied the coin in my hand, and the man's head winked at me.

######[](#dropcap)  
I sat on a park bench, eating my lunch.  I watched as a little girl rolled by on a shiny metal scooter, watching me out of the corner of her eyes.  She zipped around and passed me again.  
"Hello," I said.  
She stopped, her eyes wide.  
"I like your scooter."  
She looked down at the scooter, her ponytail flopping in her face, then beamed at me. "It's my trusty steed, Sparklehorn!"  She pointed to a pink sticker of a unicorn.  "He's a unicorn."  
"Oh, I see." I smiled. "I've never met a unicorn before."  
The girl frowned and pointed at me. "You're the time trampler."  
"Time *traveller.*"  
She shrugged.  "My mommy says I can't talk to you. She says you are dangerous."  
"Ok." I ate a bite of my sandwich. "What does your daddy say?"  
The girl twirled her hair with a finger and scrunched up her face. "He says you're a *commie bastard*."  
"Oh."  
The girl furrowed her eyebrows. "What's a 'bastard'?"  
I chuckled. "Go ask your daddy."  
The girl laid her scooter down on the sidewalk.  "Wanna see me do a cartwheel?"  
"Sure."  
I finished my lunch as the girl cavorted around me on the sidewalk.  I opened a small bag of cookies while she practiced handstands.  Upside down, she heard the crinkle of the cookie bag and turned her head towards me.  
"Are those cookies?"  She dropped her feet and stood up. "I only like chocolate chip cookies."  She paused and tried to look nonchalant. "Do your cookies have any chocolate chips, maybe?"  
"They do indeed."  I showed her the bag. "Would you like one?"  
"Yes!" she squealed.  
I held out a cookie and she snatched it gleefully.  
"Do they have chocolate where you are from?" she asked, spraying crumbs onto the sidewalk.      
"I'm from here, sweetie."  
"Noooo," she whined, "do they have chocolate *in the future*?"  
I shrugged. "I'm not from the future, I was born in this time.  And I only go backwards in time, not forwards." I paused. "I think."  
The girl thought about this for a moment.  "My daddy says you killed people. Is that true?"  
I nodded. "That's what all the history books say, so... I guess so?"  
"Why?"  
"I don't know. I haven't done it yet."  
A woman turned the corner on the sidewalk, pushing a stroller.  "Lydia," she called.  
"Uh oh," I said.  
The little girl's eyes widened and she shoved the rest of her cookie in her mouth and wiped chocolate off her face.  "Thank you," she said through a mouthful of cookie.  She scooped up her scooter and hurried back to her mother.  
Her mother scowled in recognition at me and pulled Lydia away down the sidewalk.  I sighed and began cleaning up my lunch.  
&nbsp;  
"It must be hard for you," said a voice, behind me.    
I turned to see an old man with a cane approaching my bench.  He gestured with his cane to the space beside me.  
"May I sit?"  
I nodded and tossed my lunch trash into a garbage can next to the bench.  
"I'm sorry that everyone treats you poorly," the man said. "You walk a hard enough road already."  
"I guess."  I shrugged. "It's weird knowing all these things that I will do.  Like seeing my whole life ahead of me."  
"Not your whole life," said the man. "Just the parts that history remembers." The man fiddled with his cane. "History rarely tells the whole story, in my experience."  
"I wish I knew why I did, or will do, those things." I hold up my empty hands and examine my palms. "I'm going to stab some poor painter to death in Vienna in 1906? Why would I do that? I've never hurt anyone in my life."  
The old man nodded. "Sometimes, we have to make a choice between saving a few or saving many. Maybe it was for the greater good."  
"But what about Dallas in 1963? Everyone knows that I was there." I shook my head. "Why don't I save the President? Why didn't I stop Oswald? I did nothing! Why was I even there?"  
"Don't be too hard on yourself." The old man clapped a hand on my shoulder. "Especially for something you haven't done yet."  
"Some people think that I was the one who pulled the trigger," I mumbled. "I get so many emails about grassy knolls."  
"Maybe you were," said the old man. "Maybe you weren't. Maybe you were supposed to save the President but you simply failed." The old man smiled at me. "You're only human, you know, even if you do travel through time."  
"I wish that I could just get on with it," I said. "Ever since the discovery of those old photos, I've just drifted along, waiting for time travel." I wrung my hands. "It's been ten years already.  Ten years of people avoiding me—or worse, actively trying to hurt me. Women won't date me. Nobody will hire me.  I am pretty sure that the government has people following me."  I pointed to a man in a suit, standing near a tree.  The man waved.  "See?"  
"I know it's hard," said the old man. "And, unfortunately, it won't get any easier."  
"What do you mean?"  
"Your life. It won't get any easier."  The old man sighed. "It's hard to have a wife if you're hopping through time. Hard to have a family, to raise children."  
"Oh great, thanks for that."  I rolled my eyes. "Very inspirational."   
"It's the truth." The old man shrugged. "You are going to do some very important work. It will have to be enough for you."  
I looked at the old man.  
He gave me a small smile. "What if I told you that your sacrifice will save millions of lives?" He gestured towards the people in the park—the moms with their strollers, the children, the young men playing frisbee. "All of these people, their parents, grandparents.  Their children, too.  You will save them, although you will always travel alone, it is true. But with your help, humanity will avoid several major catastrophes."  
"Is that why I kill that painter?"  
"Yes."  
"What happens if I don't?"  
The man stared into the distance. He opened his mouth to speak but closed it and stood.  
"It is better if I show you," he said. "Come with me. It's time to begin your training."  
My mouth dropped. "Wait a second... this is it? Right now?"  
The old man nodded.  
I stood up.  We begin walking.  
"Wait," I said.  "How do you know all this stuff?"  
My eyes widened.  "Oh my god..." I lowered my voice.  "Are you... me? From the future?"  
"No," said the old man, shaking his head with a chuckle. 
"I'm your son."

#### [WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.

Score: 2116

"Your seventh child is going to kill you," the witch said as I finished my drink with her.

"Seventh?" I asked. She nodded, and her tangled hair fell over her eyes. Margaret was an interesting character. She hung out around the bar and fancied herself a witch.

"Yeah," she said, "had a vision last night, sucks don't it?"

"Well you aren't wrong there," I said, if I had children I'd be freaking out."

She looked from her glass and then to me, "you don't?"

"No, never found the lady."

"Well if you do, just make sure you don't have seven."

"Will do Margaret."

Three years later Margaret and I were married. Despite her unusual views on pagan gods, she was wonderful and the love of my life. The more interesting part of her, though, was the fact that she was literally a witch. I couldn't deny it once I saw the cauldron that could let her see anyone in the city at any time. 

Three years and seven days later Margaret and I were sitting in planned parenthood. We didn't want to birth deadly children, but I'd fucked up. The visit was more about caution than coathangers, but it was still a visit. Which meant that I still saw Lisa.

Lisa was a blonde woman that I hadn't met before this day. She walked up and swore that she knew me from somewhere. We had talked for a while before I put my glasses on and it clicked for her. I had been her sperm donor for her artificial insemination. I looked at her with wide eyes and then to Margaret.

"How could you forget that you were a sperm donor?" she asked as we walked back from planned parenthood. We were eating ice cream, I was a vanilla person, and she liked black licorice for its name.

"It wasn't a big deal at the time," I said, "I did the shit for the twenty bucks and the cute girl at the counter."

"You flirted with someone by whacking it in the room beside them?" she asked. I still considered it flawless logic. She shook her head, "we are going to the clinic and getting a list of your children." 

"I think that's against some privacy laws."

"Being a witch should get me burned and you still love me," she said. Margaret too a lick of her ice cream and then bit into it. "Don't be a pansy about it, illegal is nothing."

"All right," I said, and we went to the clinic.

Three spells later we had somehow managed to get all of the released information about my children. Most of them were names and some birth addresses, but we were told it was incomplete information. We didn't have days. 

"You have 42 children?" Margaret asked as she looked over the paper.

"Are you impressed?" I asked.

"Terrified," she answered, "and you're a fucking idiot. Do we know who number seven is?"

"No birthdates, but they shouldn't be older than fifteen now anyway."

"Fifteen is the perfect age for father killing!" she said a little too loud in the middle of the street, "your magic blood will be potent in them by then! Who know's what they will do?" for the first time in my life I saw Margaret's eyes waver.

"FATHER!" a scream came from the other side of the street, "I hope you are prepared! I am your first seventh child!" I looked toward the voice and saw a little waif of a brunette carrying a sword, "prepare for your reckoning!" she screamed, and her sword went ablaze. Fuck.

"We weren't done talking about this," Margaret said as she raised a hand. Within a second the girl tripped and fell. She ended up beside her sword and caught on fire. I watched in horror as she burned.

"Do what you want father!" she screamed while also screaming, "when I die the eighth shall be seventh! One of us will drink your blood!" she yelled before she stopped screaming. Death calmed her down.

"Oh god dammit," Margaret said beside me, "I only have so many luck curses, and I don't think all of them are going to be stupid enough to have a flaming sword."

"What are we going to do?" I asked.

"I have no idea," she said, "but it's probably going to take years."

#### [WP] You came back to your house from buying a cigarette, and you found your son looks 14 years older, and he claimed that you left the family 14 years ago under the pretense of "buying a cigarette"

Score: 2112

My son ask where I have been for the last 14 years.

As reality washes over me it becomes clear that I have done much more than go "buy a cigarette". I suddenly recall my walk to the store taking me not around the corner, but around the world. 

I remember running down the streets of Pamplona and being gored by a bull as I dive over a fence. It is at that moment that I suddenly feel agony of the residual pain in my chest from now healed wound. Trying to breathe once again, my son stroke my hand and smiles at me lovingly.

I am then thrust back to a memory of clinging onto the side of a snowy faced mountain in the Himalayas. Only, I am there alone after my guide and all other members of the expedition were engulfed by avalanche. My face displays the agony of my lungs failing as my oxygen is depleted.   

My son grabs my arm as I seem to fall to my knees grasping my chest. My son demands for me to stay with him.

I once again retreat into a horrid memory. Now I am holding onto the side of a hand carved canoe floating down the Amazon river. I am attempting to re-enter the canoe as I feel unmistakable pain of hundreds of piranha ripping the flesh from my badly infected torso. I strain to kick and pull myself into the craft only to fall deeper into the water. I feel myself sliding into the murky abyss gasping for fresh air. Only, now the bites are becoming greater as I realize that a feeding frenzy is occurring and I am the chum inviting more predators. 

Now lying on the ground, my son once again forces me into consciousness and pleads with me to hold on and fight to stay alive. "Don't give up!" are the only words I can understand him saying.

Then I am yanked back into my dreadful dream state and realize that I am now in the car I drove 14 years ago. I am screaming for help as the car begins to submerge into the flowing stream. I kick, yell and curse only to sit helplessly as the car reaches bottom. All is quiet except for the my breathing and the sound of water bubbles escaping from the crevices surrounding me. I realize that I must break the windows to escape. I kick one last time and the window gives way as I am deluged by the oncoming water. I take what may be my last breath and attempt to swim to the surface. The pressure in my ears is unbearable as I race for the surface. Seeing the glow of the light at the surface is so close, yet so far. I recognize that this is the end. 

I return to my senses, but in a different state. I can hear everyone. My family and my friends surrounding me. All of them crying. Not tears of joy for seeing me once again after 14 years. But an outpouring of sadness. It is only then that I see myself. Lying in a hospital bed. No longer breathing on my own, but with the aid of a machine. A machine that has been extinguished. And with the removal of power I see myself fighting to breathe. Only there are no sounds other than the electronic sound of my heart fluttering. There is no movement as I desperately fight to breathe. 

My crippled lungs are unable to gather enough oxygen to feed my brain any longer. It is only then do I realize that I am dying. The memories I experienced are not of adventures I had of traveling the world. They are of the torment of trying to capture a single breath every day for 14 years. 14 years of struggling to live after I chose to have another cigarette. 14 years of missing my son grow older due to my debilitating lung cancer. 

The machine in the room goes silent as does this tale. But you should feel free to light up.

#### [WP] You're a supergenius-level robotics expert. Your neighbor is a godlike magician. You use your abilities solely to prank each other.

Score: 2104

The day my toilet disappeared while I was using it was the last straw.

I asked nicely. I even pleaded, but no amount of groveling would make my shitter reappear. As Bugs Bunny says, "'Dis means war."

A few days later, her SUV decided to take a walk. Literally. It rose on its hind wheels to take a lovely stroll down the street as my neighbor watched in bewilderment. She glared at me knowingly as it began to dance a jig, putting dents in the asphalt where it landed. It was some of my finest work, and I couldn't help but laugh as the black behemoth moved fluidly in ways it was never meant to go. 

The next day I received flowers at work. This in itself is odd enough, but these flowers wouldn't stop multiplying. Every time I would take a bunch out, two bunches appeared in their place. Eventually my office was overrun by orchids and we locked the door in the hopes that it would stem the tide. The next morning, all of them had disappeared. If I didn't know better, I'd think she was flirting with me.

I retaliated by gifting her a pair of pants built around the smallest machines I was capable of creating. Of course, she knew I did *something* to them, but she didn't know what until I saw her in her garden. I clapped my hands and shouted, "MICHAEL JACKSON LIVES!" as loud as I could. The pants immediately jerked her upright and, from speakers I had hidden in the area, forced her through the entire dance line for 'Billy Jean', which was both entertaining and amazing. I'm fairly sure she already knew most of the moves, considering my pants had no effect on the rest of her body - yet she went along with it as if every motion was fluidly practiced. She smiled as it ended. I worried.

The back-and-forth battle intensified.

My morning coffee turned into a dove and flew away.

Her cell phone moved to a different counter every time she turned her back.

My wallet moved to a different pocket every time I reached to pay for something.

Her laptop spontaneously converted itself to a Mac and back every few hours.

My living room got turned into a full-size replica of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, complete with sweaters. 

All the faucets in her house started spewing beer.

My refrigerator had everything inside of it turned to guacamole, then she invited herself over with a few pitchers of beer.

I think I'm falling for my neighbor.

The bird shit fell straight to my shoulder, painting a black and white drip down the sleeve of my new shirt.

"Perfect!" I said, looking up at the sky. "Just perfect. Thank you, God! Thank you so much for that! I was on my 
way to a job interview!"

I felt a bump on my stomach, coming from the inside out. In a second, a felt incredibly sick, like I might throw up 
the whole universe. My eyelids went down and I fell to my knees. My head hit the curb.

&nbsp;

When I came to my senses I was surrounded by people in brown robes, Eyes Wide Shut style. I was in a metal chair, and the robed dudes were sitting in a wide circle around me. The ceiling was high over my head and the air felt cold and smelled of dust.

I was in a warehouse.

"What the fuck is going on now?" I asked, looking around.

"Silence, newcomer," one of the robed figures bellowed. I couldn't see their faces.

"Perfect! Just perfect!" I said. "Now I was kidnapped by a secret cult! Fucking genius, universe! Thanks again!"

One of the figures rose on its feet, grabbed a tiki torch from its side and took fast steps towards me.

"Oh, and they have fire!" I said, eyes up to the sky. "They're gonna burn me and shit! I swear to God, ever since 
Janine left me it's been –"

"This is why you are here," the figure said, in a low voice.

I turned my eyes down to the figure. I could make a bearded chin under the hood, but no more than that. 

"You guys look like extras in a Mortal Kombat movie," I said.

A soft murmur ran through the room. The figure took another step towards me. "You have achieved master level."

"What's that?" I asked.

The figure took yet another step and removed his hood. He was in his fifties. Strong jawline. Big blue eyes. "You 
are now a master on the art of bitching," he said. 

"Come again?"

"Upon completing ten thousand hours of training, the chosen ones are granted access to the inner circle of light," he 
said calmly. "It is not our duty to tell you *what* to train. The pupil must decide this themselves. And you have 
chosen 'bitching'."

"God damn it, fuck my life…"

"Precisely," the figure continued. "You have now bitched about your life for ten thousand hours. You are a master of 
bitching, and, as such, are allowed into the circle of inner light."

"Thought it was inner circle of light."

The bearded man's eyes straightened. "I am not a master of patience, mind you…" he said, in a threatening voice.

"So… what?" I said. "I get to join the clan? What do you guys do here all day?"

"We are silent heroes," the man continued. "We save the world from harm with our powers."

"Powers? What's your power?"

The man cleared his throat. "I… I watch football games."

I raised my eyebrows. "You watch football games?"

"Yes. I have watched ten thousand hours of football games, and thus I have become a master spectator of the 
sport. It is not what I would have chosen to do, had I known of the society early on, but –"

"Didn't we discuss this already, Earl?" Came a voice from behind me. "Stick to the approved script with the new 
kid."

"It's easy for you to say, you mastered sword fighting," the man called Earl replied. He turned to me. "Be that as it 
may. I can spot anything in a football match in a matter of seconds. I have successfully stopped three attempted 
bombings at football stadiums. One look at the TV screen and I know what everyone is doing."

I nodded. "Ok… and what does bitching superpowers look like?"

"That…" the man said, eyes down on me, "is what you are here to find out." He turned back. "Bring the prisoner!"

Two figures in robe rose from their seats and disappeared in the darkness behind them. A second later they were 
back, carrying tiki torches with one hand, a man in shackles in the middle of them. They dragged the man all the way to the center of the circle and dropped him on his knees in front of me.

"This is Sid," Earl the bearded guy said. "He is a murderer. He has killed eight prostitutes in the last twelve 
months, and no one will arrest him because his father is an influential politician in the country he comes from.

"Uh-hum," I said, looking down at Sid. He looked up at me in anger and spat on the floor.

Earl took a step forward, standing between me and Sid. The tiki torch's fire over my head warmed the right side of 
my face.

"Now…" Earl said, looking from Sid to me. "Bitch."

The robed figures all rose to their feet and stepped closer. The circle closed in. "Bitch... bitch... bitch," they chanted.

I studied Sid's dirty face. He was breathing fast, grunting in anger.

"Ok…" I said. I thought about it. Then, "I always forget to take out the seasoning package of my instant ramen before dumping the whole thing into boiling water. And then I have to try and fish the packet out with two spoons like an idiot, and it makes me mad."

For a second, nothing happened. Then Sid's eyes went wide. Then wider. Then he opened his mouth and water 
started coming out of it. Boiling water.

Sid screamed. Bubbling, steaming water poured from his nose. His eyes. From his ears, two packets of 
chicken seasoning sprouted out and fell to the floor. Sid screamed and screamed and fell.

Cooked Ramen sprouted from his pores, painted red in blood. He let out a final yell, coughed a Louisiana Spicy 
packet and fell silent.

I looked from his dead body to Earl to the other robed figures, who were all standing in awe.

"Cool…" I said, smiling for the first time that week.

Dear Julie,

I'm sorry I haven't written sooner but it's been hell out here. We lost a lot of ground to the Allies after the disaster at Normandy. It's a battle just to hold the ground we have, they are an unstoppable force. Even now they are not far from us.

I count each sunrise and sunset as one more passed until I see you again. The sound of guns and sights of death have nearly broken my soul but for the picture of you I carry, it brings me hope even in the darkness.

Pray for me. Pray that I will survive this conflict, that I will see you again. Pray for my brothers, pray that this spilled blood is not in vain.

You don't know me. I hope you can forgive me.

I had a captured soldier translate this for me and he writes this now.

I am sorry.

I have stolen the sunset and sunrise from a man today. And I have stolen that man from you.

There is no asking for forgiveness in this, I do not deserve it.

I will pray for you now.

Through the mud, blood, and death I will wade and if it should be my end then that will be what I deserve.

Regretfully Yours,

Score: 2075

It's been 3 weeks now since the epic thread on Reddit has ballooned to be the biggest source of information on the whole internet.  Since we woke up and found that we could not leave our houses, the whole telecommunication world has been crippled. Phones will barely work and communication is at a minimum.  Even getting to web pages take ages to load.  

According to media sites, the death toll is already very high as most people did not have enough food in their houses to sustain them for a long period of time.  Lucky for me, I have been preparing for the worst my entire life.  I have around 3 months of food and water stored, but I know it won't last me for much longer.

For some reason even the glass has become seemingly bullet proof.  We have tried hitting it with anything we can find, and even tried shooting it once (the bullet ricocheted around the apartment and we don't want to try that again).  

The worst is the nights.  Since people can't leave, the power has been slowly fading as the people that were already at the power plants have been stuck working nonstop, taking mini shifts but still not able to keep awake enough to do a good job.

Sometimes the power goes out and everything becomes very dark.  I keep hearing scratching outside my doors and windows, so I know something is out there, and it doesn't sound very human.  Hopefully the stuck doors keep whatever is out there where it is.  

I have read some stories about people successfully escaping from their house, but soon after, never to be heard from again.  Hopefully someone can figure out what is actually happening soon, I don't know how much longer I can take being cooped up.

Score: 2060

*Chris this, Chris that. Chris, you're so cool. Chris, let me help you with that. I'm sick of this shit.*

Chris Mayer, the freshmen who just joined high school, was loved by everyone immediately. The girls, the guys, the jocks, the losers- everyone wanted to be his friend. Me? It was my senior year. 

One day, I was eating lunch in a bathroom stall and just grew sick of it all. Sick of the unfair bullshit, the way people were nice to him but hated me. It was just because of his cancer, I knew it damn well. Worst of all was the way he smiled at me, or waved and said hi to me like nothing was wrong. It was him I hated most. 

June 19th: the day I graduated from high school. My uncle was there, but no other family, and certainly no friends. Yet there that little bastard was, IV rack in hand, cheering and clapping for the senior class. Someone dedicated a speech to him. Everyone gathered around him after the ceremony. My uncle left halfway through, before I even got on stage. 

I left before the midnight party began, just after sunset. Since my uncle had abandoned me, I was forced to take a bus stop that was almost a mile away. I took a shortcut through a side alleyway to the building our graduation had been held in, where I found Chris bent over and retching violently.

"Oh, dear," he said weakly, forcing a small laugh. "I came here so no one would see me like this. It's pretty bad these days."

No words formed in my mind; there was only an animalistic rage swirling, mudding my thoughts. I pummeled the living shit out of that frail, little boy. Every punch was vindication, every tooth knocked loose a symbol for my shattered dignity. Soon I was just taking out all my angers on him; my family, my loneliness, my uselessness. He was an emotional punching bag I'd made literal.

By the time I stopped, it was too late. Fuck, there was so much blood on me and the road, and his twisted little body. And yet, through labored breaths, through broken bones and missing teeth, he tried to smile. He tried to say something to me as well, but the blood pooling in his throat left the words inaudible before he started choking. 

I ran. I didn't call for help, I just ran. No one caught me, somehow, and he died that night in a hospital bed. Not from the cancer eating away at him, but from my fists. I cried the whole night, and couldn't sleep for three days because every time I closed my eyes, I saw his mangled little face trying to smile. That whole time, it was *me* I hated, not him. 

That night, I went home and punched myself in the face as hard as I could. I wanted to give myself a taste of what I'd given the poor boy in his last few hours, to feel what he felt, but no matter how many times I hit my face... I felt nothing. I checked a mirror to see if I'd just broken myself, but I looked sharper than ever.

Ever since then, I've haven't been able to hurt someone with a punch. In fact...I heal them, like my hands are imbued with the life I stole from him. Hands I'm afraid of, because I know he's haunting me.

I don't know how...

...but I wish they'd worked that way on the day I graduated.

The priest spread his arms, a small wooden cross in one hand and a leatherbound bible in the other. The huge man that the demon was possessing lay before him, spread almost entirely across his queen-sized bed. "I stand before you empowered by God!" The priest shouted. "You lay powerless before me!"

"Yeah, that's right, father," the demon said, eyes closed. "Give it to me! Give me that God power!"

"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I cast you *out*!"

"I'm coming out!" The demon bellowed.

"*Out*!"

"I'm coming!"

"*OUT!*"

The demon flopped his head back onto the pillow. "Sorry, Father. It's not happening. I wanted it to, but I'm not feeling it. It's just..."

The priest lowered his arms. "No, it's not you, it's me. Sorry, this is a little weird for me. I've never done it this way before."

"It's not your fault," the demon said. "Usually I'm trying so hard to hold myself in. When I'm actually straining to release myself... I don't know, I guess I'm psyching myself out?" He shrugged. 

The priest raised his eyebrows. "Maybe a little roleplaying would help?"

The demon smiled. "What are you suggesting?"

"Well, if trying to do what I say just makes it harder, maybe you should pretend to resist?"

"Yeah... Yeah, okay. Let's give it a try. Do you-- Are you going to start, or?"

The priest stuttered. "Um, I-- Yeah, yeah, I'll start." He cleared his throat, feeling nervous. "Hear my command! In the name of our Lord I demand that you acknowledge my power!"

"You have none, puny servant of God!" The demon snarled. "This man's soul is mine! You cannot touch me!"

"Silence, beast! Your words are meaningless, and will not deter me!"

"Your faith is nothing against the power of Hell!" The demon's eyes flicked to the flask of holy water on the nightstand. "And whatever you do," he hissed, "don't dare splash me with that foul holy water!"

A smile twitched at the priest's mouth before he recovered himself. He picked up the flask. "Feel the power of Christ's ointment, foul creature!" He uncapped the flask and splashed it's contents on the demon's face. 

"GAAH!" The demon screamed. "Fiend! You got it in my hair!"

"Taste the sweet essence of the Lord!" Water gurgled from the flask.

"ARRGH! I *won't* be banished, priest! I don't care how much of your fluid you douse me with!"

"Begone, demon! In Christ's name, I command that you leave this man in *peace*!" The priest thrust his cross into the demon's face.

"NOOO!" The demon howled. His host began to choke and cough, and smoke, black as pitch, billowed from his mouth in a rush. A horrible sucking sound filled the room as the demon was expelled from the man's body. Finally, the exorcism was complete, and the demon hovered above his host in a roiling black cloud. "Whew!" The demon said. 

The priest slumped down onto the bed, and sighed. The man lying on it was unconscious. "Now *that* was an exorcism."

The demon paused. "Um. You know, I could possess him again, if you're ready for round two?"

Dan always had the coolest parents.  He could do whatever he wanted and they never seemed to care.  Most of the time they weren't around.  When they were they just told us to have those microwave meals and "take care of ourselves" like we were adults too.  My mom never let me have those microwave meals, she said they were bad for you, and she was always nagging me to do my homework.  Not like Dan's parents, we could do whatever we wanted there.

I remember when we would make pretend armies and wage war for control of the Carpet Kingdom.  The cans were our infantry, the small bottles were the cavalry and the bigger bottles were the artillery.  We would have huge armies and fight over the whole house, from one end of the carpet to the other.

Today his parents had let him set up a swing in their house.  He had attached one end of the rope to a light fixture and the other end kept his feet dangling off the ground.  I gave him a push and he swung back and forth.  "When do I get to go?" I asked.  He didn't say anything, but he never said much.  I couldn't wait for my turn.

#### [WP] A genius serial killer who has been killing successfully for a decade. With one weakness. He can never ever lie. He's finally gets caught and is facing trial for a murder in court. Yet, he walks, acquitted of all charges.

Score: 2049

The key to my success has always been planning. I choose my victims months in advance, and work around the clock. Maps of their common haunts, and schedules showing where the victim will be at any given time. Charts of friends and family. Details of her job and boss and coworkers. Even her dirty secrets, discovered through keyloggers and blackmailing friends. And once I know her better than her own husband (I always choose married women), then I begin to plot the kill. I begin to get close to the victim, worming my way into her life. Making *her* obsessed with *me*.

And it works, every time. The box on my shelf rattles with twenty three wedding rings. A monument to planning for every possible contingency. And most importantly, planning to get caught. Most serial killers never expect it to happen. They're consumed by their hubris. They think they're special. *They* are the ones who will get away with it. Fools.

March 14, 2014: the day I was found. I was waiting in bed, unable to sleep. I heard the light patter of footsteps on my deck from tip-toeing black boots. I could barely contain my glee. The windows exploded inward, spraying shards of glass all over my perfectly clean apartment. The door to my bedroom splintered and buckled under the force of the battering ram. I was calmly sitting against my headboard with a pleasant smile and my hands clasped behind my head. The SWAT members looked a bit unnerved, and slapped the cuffs on me. They roughed me up a bit, and I squealed in pain as they expected. Not that I actually care; this will only help my defense. 

I sat in court, watching the forensics investigators explain all of the evidence gathered from my home. The books that I'd published, full of eerily similar details that correspond to the killings. The maps and charts that I had prepared with facts that only the killer would know. The long unexplained travel absences. My journal, full of confessions about the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction that comes with a successful kill. The knives, stained with dried human blood. They called me to the stand, of course, but I pleaded the Fifth.

And then... the case began to fall apart. It's all part of being a fiction writer, my defense attorney explained. All research for my next work, which is entered into evidence. A first person perspective of a serial killer. Completely fictionalized, of course. The charts and maps were found to have grievous errors that the *actual* killer would not have made, including where the victim might be on the night of the murders. The charts had similar inaccurate details. My defense attorney explained that I did my best to piece the crimes together from news stories and a friend within the police department. Poor Jacob... his name was dragged through the mud and his career ruined, but he ended up corroborating my story. He was a necessary sacrifice. The journals were simply fictional, and contained no details about the actual cases.

The knives were my coup de grâce. What a *sloppy* killer I was, to leave physical evidence on the blades! If only I'd scrubbed harder! It's what the prosecutor called a "smoking gun." She took great pleasure in waving the weapon around the courtroom, detailing how I had sliced open the victim mercilessly. Then it was my turn. My attorney brought in the key surprise witness: a morgue employee that I had bribed. He let me in late one night to practice on an unnamed Jane Doe. I'd told him I was an author, and that I was interested in being able to vividly describe the sound and feel of a knife cutting into flesh. And it was the truth. I never lie. It's not quite the same when they're dead, but I enjoyed this bit of alibi building nonetheless.

I still remember the prosecutor's face after his testimony. She had nothing on cross-examination, and she could see her career going down the tubes. This was the most publicized trial the city had had in years, and she was completely blowing it. I wondered if she'd get fired for this. If not, I'd have to pull a few more strings. I gave her a sympathetic head nod and a barely-concealed smirk, and she couldn't hide the smoldering anger. 

After the acquittal, we shook hands in front of a hundred flashing cameras. She put on her fakest smile and declared that justice had been served. She clenched my hand tighter and for a brief moment let the mask drop; she looked like she wanted to gag. With a wave to the reporters, she whispered into my ear: "I know you did it. And I'm going to stop you."

I continued shaking her right hand, eying the soft gold wedding ring on the other and picturing it in my collection. "You'll try," I told her. "Looking forward to seeing you again soon." I *really, really* was.

#### [WP] Cause of death appears to you as floating text over people's heads with no time indication. You start noticing a trend.

Score: 2043

I stop noticing the causes after a while. They were boring. Lots of heart disease and various types of cancer. I was in college; those things were years and years down the road. Every once and a while, I'd see things like "suicide" or "automobile crash." Though sad and preventable, I had no real way of knowing when it would happen or why. So there was nothing I could do about it. 

But some deaths were preventable, or changed based on new events in the world. On my way to class, I saw a young lady walking nearby with a cause that could be easily stopped: "Drug Overdose." I'm normally not one to reach out to strangers, but I figured I had to get involved. This was definitely a college-age cause of death. I ran across the quad and asked her out. She was shocked, but smiled shyly and accepted. Her name was Sarah, and her sign changed after about a month of us dating. Now, it says "dementia;" I still check every morning when I wake up. It's sad, but I take comfort in knowing we'll live a long life together.

After a few years, I learned to just tune the signs out. I had so much on my mind now. Work, baby on the way, mortgage, student loans... far too much for me to be worrying about how other people might die. Sure, I got involved when I could, but that wasn't very often. And who am I to thwart fate?

My boss entered my office with a new client folder and dumped it on my desk, on top of the 10 other folders requiring my attention. "Howard is out sick today," he informed me, "so you need to take this one." I rolled my eyes and looked up, ready to argue. But instead of the usual "heart attack" floating over his head, he had a new one. Bright green, like how I picture radioactive sludge. And it said "Plague."

I was too distracted to argue. I'd never seen a "plague" sign before. I stood up from my cubicle and glanced around the office at my coworkers. 7 of them had changed to "plague" as well. When had this happened?? As I watched, a secretary's red "suicide" sign changed to "plague" as well. 

I hopped online looking for any news about some new disease or anything. Nothing. I searched for outbreaks and 'mystery' illnesses and any other search term I could think of. Nothing. Maybe it was a long way off. Maybe I had plenty of time. 

I left early that day. I couldn't be in the office. As I walked to the subway station, I began to notice more and more green. And more and more people were changing by the minute. From the looks of it, the plague would already be killing about half of New York, and that number was growing. Nearby, someone coughed, with that disgusting hacking sound of fluid-filled lungs. I scrambled across the street in utter terror and ran the rest of the way home.

Sarah was working at her desk when I arrived. Thank god; her sign was unchanged. She wouldn't be infected, at least not yet. She rubbed her tummy with a smile as I entered. "I felt him kick today," she said, practically bursting with the news. I was too distracted to react; she was crestfallen. "We need to get out of town," I said, trying to hide the panic in my voice. Her face let me know that I was failing miserably. "What is it?" she asked. I had already made my way to the bedroom and started throwing things in suitcases. I didn't have time to argue.

We made our way down to the street to get a cab. I was lugging two enormous suitcases, and dragging Sarah behind me. She was confused and scared, but had agreed to come along. At least for now. Outside, the street was a sea of bright green. I heard more and more coughing. 

We finally got into a cab. The driver had a bright green 'Plague' sign over his head. "Where to?" he asked. "JFK," I said. Well, 'shouted' would be more of an apt description.

As we drove, the thick haze of green changed suddenly to a bright purple that I'd never seen before. Almost every green sign was now gone; the few that remained were probably going to be the first outbreak victims. The purple letters spelled out "Nuclear explosion."

"You're *pun*der arrest! You have the right to remain silent," I told him as I man-handled him into the back of the police cruiser. "Everything you say can and will be used against you to make puns." We'd had to make a few little tweaks to the Miranda warning ever since bad jokes became physically hurtful.

"I didn't do nothing!" he shouted at me as I got back into the driver's seat. They always ignore the warning, don't they? 

"Well sounds like Nothing is a lucky gal," I replied. He winced and rolled his eyes, but I was just getting started. Dad Jokes were just an appetizer in the meal I was about to serve him. I fumbled around at my seatbelt, making exaggerated sounds of frustration until he stopped complaining. Finally, I managed to get it on. "Sorry for the delay," I told him. "I couldn't figure it out, and then it just clicked."

He gripped the barrier between us and shook it violently, gritting his teeth.

"You should have stopped when we told you. High speed chases never work out for the criminals. I would not... **wreck**-amend it!"

He rolled in agony, struggling against his handcuffs to cover his ears. 

"And the end of the crash, when you clipped that billboard? So ominous!"

He managed to open his eyes, which had been screwed tight. "What?"

"Ominous," I repeated. He grimaced at me, only just realizing what was about to happen.

"Because now it's a bad sign!"

"*Fuck*" he whispered to himself. Walked right into that one.... 

He'd had enough for now. Time to call this one in.

"This is Officer Rodriguez... After *combing* the area for that wig thief, high speed pursuit had ended and the victim is in custody. I am bringing him in now. Time to undergo mitosis, because we're going to need another cell!"

The radio crackled to life. 

"Damnit, Rodriguez... how many times have we told you not to to do that over the radio?"

"Sorry, sir. I must have been abducted or something." I had the bad misfortune to enjoy my job a little too much. No reason to subject the other officers to that torture. But I couldn't help but smile...

"...abducted?" asked the other officer over the radio.

"No, don't!" yelled the criminal from the backseat. But the radio wasn't transmitting; they couldn't hear him.

"Yeah," I said. "Because I got carried away..."

It's been ages. I haven't gotten any blips since before my marriage, not even from my now-ex. I'll admit it, I let myself go a bit when her and I got serious but the looks decent wagon didn't exactly pass me by. I used to get a couple a day in college but they were usually from people I barely socialized with.

The lack of blips put a strain on my marriage. The storm really came to a head when I was trying to talk to Angela about our dead bedroom and how she doesn't even play to the thought of me anymore. She told me, "Well what the fuck does it matter? I know you're getting off daily."

A lot more was said, mainly her calling me a fat pig and me dropping the C-bomb. I left that night and stayed with my brother, Shawn. I talked with him about getting my fitness back on track and he gave me some pointers: eat less crap, hit the gym, track calories, all of that stuff. I didn't see much progress in the first couple of months until I decided to put on my big girl panties and really grind it out. In the mornings I'd run a couple of kilometres as fast as I could, cut out processed food, and lifted weights in the evening. My food staples were veggies, chicken, fish, and rice. I set goals for when I hit the iron.

A month on, I needed to buy a new belt. Another month, new clothes. I felt amazing. More energy, more confidence, better sleep, and I didn't even care about the blips that I wasn't getting at that point. I had actually forgotten all about it. I was too focused on making myself better, the best I could be. Faster. Stronger. The Iron Temple was my place of worship, and I devoted to it my body, mind, and soul.

Then, eight months from the start of my journey, I got a blip one morning. I was nervous. I didn't check it at work. I didn't check it on my way home. I waited until I was in the bedroom of my new apartment, my heart in my throat. I opened the app.

"Shawn has just masturbated to you!"

EDIT: Thanks for all the kind comments, y'all are rock stars. Just like to clarify that the main character is male, I used the line "big girl panties" because it's a thing that people say to guys who need to "man up".

Score: 2019

Existing is something I'm not sure I've ever felt before. One minute I wasn't, now I was.

My first memories beyond the white abyss are staring at a djinni with a bored look on his face, and a slightly overweight and visibly sweating young man. He stammered something that resembled a hello, before falling silent. He looked shocked.

I knew what had happened, instinctively. He had used his wish for me, the most beautiful woman imaginable. When something like this happens, they send me.

I'm not pretty, conventionally. I've got muddy brown eyes, darkish brown hair, pale skin, a bit of an underbite. I'm short, a little too short, actually, with a small bust and a mediocre figure. 

I was willed into existence, and will be willed into existence, every time a wish is granted that calls for someone beautiful. The cosmic joke is that I'm supposed to represent inner beauty, and when the man finds out how nice I am, it's supposed to make him a better person.

What actually happens is the man never hesitates, and uses his second wish to wish me away. Or for a real beautiful woman, which actually gets him one. Sometimes they just leave me with the lamp, and as soon as they get far enough away I return to nonexistence. 

The present man, still speechless, drops the lamp and runs to me, crying into my hoodie. The djinni departs, his cruel bargain struck. I prepare for the inevitable disjunction, but it never comes.

He simply stays by my side, holding me like someone who has never held anyone before and knows he may never again. I hold him back.

I kiss him. He kisses me back.

Score: 2008

Dr. Gloom checked his watch for the sixth time, before sighing and looking at the rest of the line. He always thought making money would be hard once he went straight, but nobody ever warned him about all the waiting. Normies spent so much of their life waiting in lines! Back in his glory days, he could have just walked up to the teller and *demanded* the cash. There weren't many Supers who had discovered their abilities yet, and nobody was able to stop him.

A small hand tugged at his sleeve, and he quickly remembered that those days were behind him now. "Yes, sweetie?" he asked his daughter, Nora.

"When will we be done, daddy? We've been here FOR-EV-ER!" she pouted.

"Soon, remember that patience is a virtue. Maybe the teller will have a nice lollipop for you, they still do that, right?" he looked up towards the teller and searched for any bowls filled with candy. All around him, he could feel the intense stares of hate and fear. They recognized him, they knew, and they did not forgive, even after 7 years. And why should they? He was *THE* Dr. Gloom, the original Super Villain. At least Nora didn't care who he used to be, and neither did her mother. That's all that mattered to him now. Even after defeating the Super Squad numerous times, it only took a simple woman to change his life for the better.

Nora was normal, just like her mother, at least he had that much to be thankful for. He knew that being a Super meant being an outcast, and ostracized by society. Even many of the Heroes were  ridiculed and condemned as monsters.

"Daddy, it's your turn!" cheered Nora, and the doc snapped back to focus. He apologized and stepped up to the teller. "Yes, I-" he was interrupted by a large explosion by the entrance.

"I'm here to make a withdrawal!" shouted a large man wearing a firefighter's suit, as he stepped over the burning remnants of the front door. Shortly after, his two companions walked in on either side of him. The first was a short, stocky man who wore goggles on top of his head. The other man was massive, and seemed to be made of stone.

"You Normies can call me Pyro!" said the not-firefighter. He snapped his fingers together and produced a small flame, which he used to light a cigarette. Then he waved his hand to the small man at his side, "This here's Sparky."

"Oooh it looks like they've upgraded their ATMs to the newest models, these ones have one-point-five times the capacity of the previous ones!" Sparky said with glee as he ran to the nearest ATM.

"He talks too much." said Pyro, shrugging. "This other guy is Brick, he don't talk much at all."

"Hmph." grunted Brick, as he cracked his knuckles.

All of the Normies laid down on the ground, almost routine for some of them. Dr. Gloom, however, simply leaned down to tell Nora to join the others, before he turned to face the intruders. "I'm sorry, fellas, but you'll have to wait in line. Patience is a virtue, after all." he said calmly, while observing the misfit crew of wannabe Villains. "Some of us have to work for a living."

"Sparky, focus on those ATMs, and keep jamming the cell phones, we don't need cops showing up just yet." commanded Pyro. "I'll handle the teller. Brick... uh, just do your thing buddy."

"Hmph." grunted Brick, as he charged at the doc with a raised fist.

Although he wasn't as quick as he used to be, Dr. Gloom was still ready for a fight. Brick crashed through the pillar behind his target at full speed, causing chunks of rubble to plummet down onto his head.

"Hmph." grunted Brick, as he slipped into unconsciousness.

"Looks like the big guy needed a nap." remarked Dr. Gloom.

"What just happened? He phased right through you!" Exclaimed Sparky in shock.

"Well if you want to get technical, *I* phased through *him*." replied the doc with a smirk.

"Forget the cash, Sparky, let's toast this old man!" Pyro grabbed a large ax off of his back, and Sparky lowered the goggles over his eyes.

Before he knew it, Dr. Gloom was dodging balls of fire and bolts of electricity. All he had to do was distract them until their attacks set off the sprinkler system. It seemed easy, until Sparky overloaded a nearby ATM and caught him off guard. He tried to get back up, to gather his energy, but it was too late. Pyro stood above him now, ax in hand. "All these old Supers keep thinking they can beat the new breed. We are better, faster, stronger. You're just an old man." He raised the ax above his head.

"Get away from my daddy!" Shouted a voice from across the room. Nora had found the fire alarm, and pulled it as hard as she could. Suddenly water sprayed from the faucets all around the room. At first, Pyro's suit protected him from the water, but he was standing too close to Sparky, and got a shocking surprise.

Dr. Gloom got back on his feet, and smiled to his daughter across the room. "What is every Super Villain's weakness?"

Nora knew the answer. "Monologues."

#### [WP] After dying, God asks you: "So, how was heaven?"

Score: 2007

The light was the first thing I noticed, before the voice that is, it was almost blinding when I finally came to.

"Don't worry, you'll get used to the light again."

I shook my head as my eyes grew accustomed to the light. I wasn't sure where exactly I was, or how I got here, but I did remember dying. Or at least, it felt like death. You know, I had my whole family there. I was old, living out my final days in the comfort of my childhood home. My kids were there, and so were their kids, and even a few of my great-grandchildren. I had lived a good life.

"He's reliving his last moments," a second voice said. It was feminine, unlike the first.

"That's normal. Open the pod."

There was a light hissing sound as, what I realized was clear glass, opened in front of me. The room around was artificial, I knew that, but it was almost too artificial. Like it was made up in some lab a thousand miles away, never to be touched by mankind.

I finally saw who the two voices belonged to. The second was a female, as I assumed. She stood tall, posture was perfect, and her hair looked just like my daughters. Wanda. That was her name, I *knew* it.

The first voice was a man who looked old but had to be thirty years my younger. Or, was he my younger? I looked at my hands, my eyes drifting between the man's long grey beard and my own hands. They weren't wrinkly anymore. No, they were soft and *calloused*. I nodded.

"How was Heaven?"

I almost laughed at God's comment, that wasn't his *actual* name, that's just what everyone called him around here. He was the Creator and the Savior, and just about everything in between.

"Better," I finally managed to croak out, my voice was coarse. From the pod, the fluids they fed me, I remembered that too. "I made it to ninety-seven." I coughed a bit, thick pockets of dried phlegm coming out of the back of my throat.

"We watched your progress. A perfect run."

I agreed. "I can do better. Next time I go in."

Wanda sighed at the comment and then I remembered.

My eyes shut and my hands found their way to my face. I rubbed at it, trying to get the feeling back, trying to make my brain work again. "What'd you learn?"

"We threw everything we could at Heaven this time, tried to find what failed here. Unfortunately, your path as a Doctor and not a Politician as we agreed didn't help much."

"I had limited options with the background you gave me."

God waved his hands, "All part of the test, which you did pass by the way."

I reached for the towel Wanda was now handing me. One of the downsides to our home was the cold, and the fact that you had to be naked going in the pod. I cleaned myself off before stepping out and heading towards my locker.

"How'd the others do?"

"Seven were successful, including you," Wanda said. She was reading from her clipboard, I knew that. "Thirteen failed. Three critical. One death."

I shuddered, one of the downsides of Heaven, if you died there from causes not specifically coded, you had trouble getting *back*. "Who?"

"I think you need rest before we debrief you, L."

I turned back to them and threw on my jumpsuit, a dark crimson color, to denote my status as God's second. "Who?"

God sighed, "Jasper. He died in the war that plagued your nation, complications arose when we tried to wake him. He never came to."

I sighed, Jasper was a great solider, servant, and a better friend. I would miss him deeply. "So, what did you learn? I have one KIA, three in critical, and nine fails. I want some answers."

Wanda shook her head, "Unfortunately, we don't have many. We attributed some of the pitfalls to the aspects of humanity of the time. Others to random factors."

"That's it?" I petitioned, "*Random* factors?"

God took my shoulder, "Yes. In the end, a world with free will," he sighed, "it will always have chaos. The necessity of man, to say the least."

I shook my head, "Then how do you fix that? Free will, I mean, you found everything on that belief. All of us here do."

God turned to Wanda, who smiled for a moment, "We have one solution as of now. For the next phase."

I raised an eyebrow, "You're going ahead with it? The Creation?"

God nodded, "I am. After millennia of searching for answers, after thousands of iterations of heavens, fallen children, your brothers and sisters."

I held up my hand and nodded. I remembered. Every single day I remembered. Their names, their faces. Everything about them.

"I am splitting us up."

I looked back to God, "You're doing what?"

Wanda chimed in, "In all of our ideas. We had the Creation and we had us, here. We feed the Creation what it needs and they eventually come back to us. However," Wanda took a deep breath, "however, sometimes it fails. In worse ways than just death."

"How?"

"We lose every essence of the one we sent in." God shook his head, "I will not allow that."

"So how do you fix it while maintaining free will?"

"We create a third plane of existence. One the Created would come to fear."

I raised an eyebrow, "Fear?"

God nodded, "Yes. In that plane, they would be judged and sentenced. It would be for all who do not fulfill their life's purpose. For those who need more time."

I nodded, "So the Judgement is made, they do the punishment and then go back?"

"Yes, and they keep trying. Again and again."

"Until it works," Wanda finished. "I already ran the diagnostics with the other  engineers. It will work."

"Who decides the Judgement?"

God lowered his head, "You will."

I stepped back, "*What*?"

"Wanda, a moment," God ordered and she didn't hesitate. She left the room almost immediately and God turned back to me. "You are my most-trusted asset. My greatest Creation. For that, you must lead the plane that the other Created will fear."

"You want me to go in a plane not created? You want me to create another?"

"Yes. Until the Created are ready, I need a second guide."

I shook my head, "I did my time. My penance is done. I proved it time and time again in Heaven."

"It is why I chose you and not another." God grabbed both my arms, "Lucifer. You must fall, so your brothers and sisters can rise again. They are stuck, their minds, their souls, in that plane. The millions that exist there *can* exist here again." God sighed, "But I need you to guide them."

I lowered my head, "How long?"

"As long as it takes them to redeem themselves."

"Will you help me?"

"I taught you all there is to know about the Existent Planes already. It is up to you to create one they will fear."

I stared at the ground, my heart pumped fast and my eyes grew heavy. The responsbility was overwhelming, but it was not something I could refuse. I nodded. "Okay." I looked back at him, "I will fall for them."

God smiled, and so did I, "Then let's get started."

#### [WP] It's been almost two years since people stopped dying, and five months since we started to burn the ones that should.

Score: 2001

For some it was the best of times. For others it was the worst of times. For still others, it was an amalgamation of the two that they didn't quite know how to handle. Economists tried to weigh in on it and say that the new job sector gave wages to millions across the globe. The ethicists said it wasn't fair. 

All I knew was that *my* job had drastically changed. 

They used to call us firefighters. Now they just call us firemen. Our jobs have changed from preventing fires to starting them. Some of us quit, and some of us changed to the police force or paramedics. But I've always had a mean streak, and so along with some of the sociopaths and criminals and arsonists of the world, I rose up as a new pillar in society. 

A fireman. 

The idea wasn't original, and anyone who has two flecks of fluff for brain will know where it came from. The High Order - that's what they all changed their name to after it became clear none of them could be assassinated - saw books and people as the same. Don't want a book around? Reduce it to ash. Don't want a human around? 

Well, you get where I'm going. 

It was a job, alright. At first it had just been the elderly. Just because people stopped dying didn't mean they *should* have stopped dying. There were people who were 106, wasting away and smelling of decomposition, with sores across their bodies, completely lost to the world. There were cancer patients who had been so eaten away that they barely looked human. There were accident victims whose bodies had succumbed to sepsis while their minds stayed fresh and aware. 

Those were the first to go. We called them Tier 1. The News called the mercy killings, but the High Order stuck to Tier 1. 

Then we brought in Tier 2. The criminals and low lives, the serial rapists who had figured out that they could torture their victims and never kill them. The scum that wasn't worth what you scraped off your shoe. 

The kerosene from my hose sprayed over the building. I had grown used to the smell, and it sent a small shiver down my spine with every application. An electronic beeped near my ear to indicate if enough kerosene had been discharged. 

Once that was set, I signaled to my coworker. The kerosene drained from the hose until only drips remained. My coworker reeled it back in. 

It was my favorite part. The ignition. I held the lighter, flipping the cap down and back up, inhaling. There was not a sound from inside the building. There would be soon.

Sure enough, when I returned to the truck the air was filled with screams. I turned toward my coworker.

"Which Tier is this?" 

"Tier 3." 

"Didn't know there was a Tier 3. Who's in this batch?" 

I looked back at the orange flames that licked the sky, bringing Heaven and Hell together as one. The best of times, the worst of times, or an amalgamation of the two. 

"Dissenters."

#### [WP] Write a story about something you don't understand. Do NO research. Make everything up as you go.

Score: 1999

"Alright Dr. Cameron, it appears that the patient is going to need a triple bypass if they are going to live," Dr. Ericson casually quipped over a lukewarm cup of joe.

It did indeed appear that the patient was having a difficult time with getting his poor heart to cooperate with him, as he had apparently recently taken to participating in butter drinking competitions all around the United States.

I thought to myself for a moment, then replied "Yeah, I guess so. Probably time to move him to the ER." The patient had been very unconscious for the past 15 minutes or so.

The patient was strapped to a gurney and transported from the waiting room and wheeled into an operating room by a team of medical personnel. It was about 3:00 AM, and all of the staff were nearing exhaustion. I followed the rest of the nurses to the operating room soon after, and Dr. Ericson was sipping his coffee right next to the operating table.

As a wave of tiredness came over me, I had to strain myself mentally to remember my medical training, lest this man die on my table. *Alright first step... Yeah, I think i should probably wash my hands so i don't give him an infection.*

As I scrubbed my hands, Dr. Ericson put his gloves on and pulled out his tray of surgical instruments. "Ready doctor?" He asks me through his surgical mask.

"Yep, as long as I stay awake," I reply. Tonight was going to be a long night. I put my latex gloves on, and as I approached the table, I saw that the patient was fully prepared for me, ready to go. First, I asked the nurse for a scalpel and made a vertical incision about 8 inches long above the sternum.

And this is exactly where I forgot what I was supposed to do. Embarrassed, I asked Dr. Ericson "So, remember back to med school? If I were testing you now, what would you say the next step would be?"

"Uh, I guess it would help to get through the ribcage," Dr. Ericson replied. "I think there is probably a hacksaw for that around here somewhere."

It became apparent to me then, that Dr. Ericson was under the same spell of fatigue that I was. He began clanking around a few drawers looking for the saw, when a nurse began to ask "Hey doctor, aren't you supposed to..."

"Quiet, nurse," I interjected. I wasn't about to have some under-educated peon lecture me on how to do my job.

The clanking stopped, and Dr. Ericson looked up from his drawer "Found one!" he exclaimed as he held it high: a rusted hacksaw covered in white paint chips, clearly last used for woodworking.

I replied to the doctor, "Well, it'll have to do, I guess." The nurses were all giving each other terrified glances at this point, but must have been to afraid to say anything else. I took the saw from Dr. Ericson, and as I was about to begin, I remembered something rather important.

"Dr. Ericson, have you administered anesthesia yet?" I asked. The patient was unconscious for now, but probably wouldn't remain that way if I had begun my violent assault on his sternum.

"Oops." was his only reply. He strolled over to the medicine cabinet, and grabbed a bottle of morphine. He inserted a syringe into the bottle, and drew the plunger to about 30mL. "This'll do," he remarked to himself.

The morphine was injected intravenously, and the operation proceeded. The sternum was hard to make it through with the hacksaw, but five minutes and elbow grease are enough to saw through mostly anything.

I didn't remember what the device to hold the ribcage open was called, and I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of these dumbass nurses again, so I told one of them to keep the rib cage open by holding the halves apart. With their hands. Now, I could see the bottom tip of the heart beneath the patient's lungs. Still mostly inaccessible, so I cut the connective tissue keeping the lungs in place, and spread them out to the sides like wings. Unfortunately, the lungs weren't functioning any more.

"You. Nurse. Go get one of those things that you pump into his mouth so he can breathe," I ordered.

"A... what?" The obviously horrified and anxious nurse replied.

Unable to remember what the device was called, I sighed and said, "Just... perform mouth-to-mouth for the remainder of the procedure."

At this point, the area around the table was beginning to become crowded with nurses crawling all over this poor man, to keep his ribs open and to keep him breathing. I looked to check the EKG to see if his vitals were still good, at which point I realized that I forgot to connect one. I ordered the nurses to set one up, and after everything was set up, I noticed that his blood pressure was very low.

"We are going to need to give this man a blood transfusion," I stated. "Dr Ericson, would you be so kind to set up the transfusion?"

"Sure thing," He replied. Taking a bag of O-negative out of the freezer, he thawed it under his armpit for a couple of minutes and then inserted it into IV, commanding a nurse to hold the bag up and let gravity do the rest of the work.

After a few minutes, blood pressure began to return to normal. With his heart exposed, the real operation could begin. At this moment, I remembered that a bypass surgery involved taking veins from the legs and using them to "bypass" the clots, but I could not for the life of me remember which veins to take. From the look on Dr. Ericson's face, he couldn't either. Attempting to save face, I asked Dr. Ericson "Would you be so kind as to perform the vessel removal from this patient's left leg?"

He turned bright red, and began to look around the room. "Me? Now?"

I just stared at him for a minute.

"Fine." He grabbed a scalpel and cut into the patient's left leg, and removed a 6 inch segment of the largest vessel he could find, and what remained of it began to bleed profusely.

I had no idea what to do at this point, I was just too tired. "Well, shit. I guess we'll have to amputate. I don't think we can save that leg.

The nurses obviously didn't agree with what was going on, with their judgmental, wide-eyed stares and heavy breathing. They weren't the ones holding the scalpel, so they could piss off for all I cared. 

I took the hack saw from before, and went to work. The leg was faster to come off than the sternum, that was immediately apparent. However, it was also bleeding much more heavily. I ordered another nurse to throw on another bag of O-negative and squeeze. I couldn't remember the rest of the amputation procedure, but I remembered back to an episode of *The Walking Dead* that I saw in season one, where some redneck cut off his own hand to escape some handcuffs and sear it with a hot pan, cauterizing the wound. I elected to go with this procedure.

We threw the leg in the bio hazard bag, as it probably couldn't be reattached and we already had the vein we needed. I cut it into three sections, one for each of the vessels that we need to bypass. Then another reality hit me; I had forgotten which three of the four vessels needed to be bypassed. A cold sweat came over me, my vision began to tunnel. I done goofed. I can't even remember how to test for which ones needed the bypass. Time to wing it, I guess.

I decided to go with vessels 1, 2, and 4, because of a video I saw with three numbered escaped greased pigs that I saw earlier, with the prank being that the #3 one was nonexistent and people would keep looking for it. I cut small holes on either side of where I believe a clot would be, and attached the veins with my trusty tube of Elmer's super glue. Monitoring the patient's vitals, it appeared that it worked, since some of the numbers began shifting around and it wasn't beeping at me.

I glanced at Dr. Cameron, who gave me a wink and a thumbs up. I knew that two doctors couldn't possibly be wrong, so everything must be going well. Only three nurses left during the procedure, two of them due to physical exhaustion from holding the patient's ribs open and one due to a bout of unconsciousness. Must have been too squeamish to assist during open heart surgery, they shouldn't have even been allowed to graduate med school.

I placed the lungs back to their native position, and used super glue in the place of where I made the earlier incisions to disconnect them. I relieved the rib-holder nurse of duty, and stapled the sternum back together. I asked Dr. Ericson to finish sewing the patient back up while I remove my gloves and wash my hands. After taking one last look at his vitals and determining that they probably looked fine, I ordered the nurses to bring the patient to a recovery room where he would remain until he woke, at which point he would be sent home.

Due to reasons unknown to me, none of them responded, or even looked in my direction for that matter. They cleaned the blood off of the patient and wheeled him out. Sighing a sigh of relief, i turn to Dr. Ericson. "Just another day on the job, right?"

"Yep. I guess we'll see what tomorrow brings."

"We sure will."

Dr. Ericson and I donned our coats, and returned to the parking lot. He finished his coffee on the way to his car.

"This seems kind of weird," Kendra was sitting in a reclining leather chair. Behind her were several people in long judge costumes complete with powdered wigs. "I don't know anything about the worth of someone's life or where they should go."

"Never had a religion or a code of ethics?" one of the judges raised an eyebrow. Kendra couldn't really tell them apart, but there was only one that spoke. 

"Not that I remember," Kendra began to play with the hem of her dress. "But a lot of it is blank. I don't...I don't *think* I did."

"That's ok," the judge waved his hand. "Sometimes we just like to get outside opinions."

Kendra thought there was something seemingly off about this, but couldn't put her finger quite on what. She swallowed as the chair turned back around and she looked up at the screen. 

It was like watching life through someone's eyes. There were little snippets of action - the world opening up like a flower in bloom and seeing two faces looking down at her. A man in a mask and a woman who held her close. 

There was the sound of crying and babbling. A muffled argument late at night while a mobile spun lazily above her head. The sound of a woman singing and the surprising feel of a hand in hers. 

Kendra jumped, pulling her hand from the armrest into her lap. Behind her there came laughter. "Don't be alarmed," the voice of the judge. "This will feel quite real at times."

Slowly the world began to shift from horizontal to vertical. Trees that had seemed massive began to shrink. There was a man's face that peered down at her with disappointment. A sharp pain across her face and around her upper arm. A whisper that wound its way into her ear. *Don't you ever tell a soul.*

A young child that sneered at her and taunted her with cries of *chicken legs* and *freak*. The running of a sink and hearing sniffling sounds that reached her own ears. 

Smiling faces. Angry faces. Faces filled with disgust. The feel of her own greasy hair as she dragged a trash bag full of things to school. The pity in teachers' faces. *Poor girl. Parents just can't keep it together.*

A small dark space. A sniffling cry. A begging to be let out that poured from her own mouth. The sound of a key and the smell of mothballs. The twisting of a doorknob and a tray of food shoved inside. 

"Please," her voice begged. "Please!"

A man who held her hand and told her it would be alright. The embarrassment of finding red between her legs in the middle of a science class. The chilly inside of a car on a winter's morning as she pulled a sweater tight around herself for warmth. 

Sitting on the side of the road with an empty cup. Looking at the faces of those disgusted with her. Walking into a store and shoving her pockets full of things. Her own hand brandishing a knife at a woman on the street. 

A bridge at night. A whooshing wind. A splash of ice. 

The picture faded. Kendra sat still and raised her hand to her face to find it wet. The chair spun again until she again faced the men in black. 

"So what do you think?"

Kendra started. "What do I think? I don't know. I think it's horrible. But I don't know if it's good or bad. Just sad. And the ending..."

"You feel sympathy for her?"

"Of course. Only pain and suffering could drive her to an end like that."

"What about her sins?" The man gave a wry smile. "What about the theft? The sloth? The knife?"

"I feel nothing but sympathy and sadness for her," Kendra said. 

"Do you think you could forgive her?"

"Forgive her? What has she done to me?"

"Could you forgive your mother for leading such a life? Your best friend? Your child? For taking the easy way out?"

"She suffered so." Kendra paused. "Of course. I just wish there was another option. To try again. I wish I could hold her hand and tell her it wasn't her fault. I wish I could give her happiness."

"What about yourself?"

Slowly the memories bloomed in Kendra's mind. She sat stunned as they flooded back. Her eyes began to sting and her throat began to tighten. "That was...that was..."

"Can you show yourself the same kindness and forgiveness you would show to someone else? Can you allow yourself to see the pain and desperation that *you* felt without the judgement or the self hatred?"

Kendra stared at them and said nothing. It felt as though someone had reached into her chest to squeeze her heart. 

The judge smiled. "Ah yes. It's much easier to see our pain when we see it through someone else's eyes. Why don't you try again? See if you can show yourself more kindness."

The judge reached out to push a button. Then, as though she had been pulled into a vacuum, the world went black.

Dexicon moved his cosmic fortress from Centauri B straight into Earth's orbit. Dexicon was able to do this in one turn thanks to the cosmic paving it had laid earlier. This allowed faster than light travel.

"Your move, God." Dexicon roared, knowing it had the ancient deity in its proverbial palm.

*Shit shit shit*  thought God. It was tough to display no emotion but a strong poker face was crucial. Dexicon had already taken Zeermon out the game and had now moved on to God.

God had not been blessed with much luck.  Each deity had been given a species that had space travel potential. The objective was to either enslave or obliterate the other species. God had unfortunately randomised the least intelligent possible species - homo.

 2.7  million years just to leave the hunter gatherer stage. This was a new record. He had had to wipe out his first few species of homo and start over - they had simply been too stupid. By the time he had rerandomised into homo-sapien he was at least 2.6 million years behind Dexicon. 

What didnt help was that the homo-sapiens turned out to be incredibly aggresive. This would be useful for fighting other species, but they mainly killed each other! Oh how Dexicon and Zeermon laughed! 

When he had finally researched the abilty to send a vassel to Earth to enlighten and guide the people, the earthlings did something unprecedented in stupidity - they decided to kill it.

Finally the humans became space able. At the time, God was pleased. They visited their local moon first, as expected. But the moon base never came. The colonisation of nearby planets never came. They regressed.

"Using your cosmic paving I move Earth into alpha Centuri B", said God, in a move that would have made the humans proud.

Dexicon's mouth dropped.

Memes.

Back in the old days, before the blackout, everyone had 'em. In every PC, in every browser, you'd find Pepes, Advice animals, Rage comics, Montage Parody's and all the inbetween, all the shades of the double-rainbow.

And then, you know, they became a bit harder to find. 

It became obvious our society could simply not survive without the Dankest of influences that had shaped our culture. Memes weren't just memes anymore.

They were life.

I'm a spelunker. I dive into old PC's, laptops, desktops, you know...I search for the past.

But I also search for the memes.

 The Meme-useum pays a lump sum to anyone who can bring 'em some good quality memes, so it's always worth looking out for 'em.

Sometimes it's hard. Entire days of searching hard drives, desktops and external storage software, only to come up empty.

But sometimes, you hit it big. You hit it real big.

I hit up my old grandpa's PC once. You wouldn't think he had anything, but oh boy I was wrong.
	
Turns out Grandpa was a 'channer. Lived for the meme, died by the meme.

When I opened that Rare Pepe folder... I knew I could retire happy. Loaded it onto to a flash drive, deleted the original (Standard practice, don't want nobody finding your old memes) and took off. 

I didn't know I was being followed. The Memes I was carrying right then were the Dankest in the world...

And everybody wanted their hands on that.

"Zed, I don't know how it happened!" I stuff my face in my hands. Then I raise my eyes. "Apparently people weren't in the mood for yet another Jobs movie, or watching Matt Damon get rescued again. Steve Carell wasn't even nominated for Big Short, and *not even Bryan Cranston saw Trumbo!*"

"Well, this is it. Humanity is doomed," Zed cries, as the lady announces that we're just five minutes away from the 
ceremony. "The second Leo gets his hand on that Oscar, it's all over. He'll destroy the Earth." He pauses. "We gotta do something, man!"

"It's too late now, Zed," I say, shaking my head. "Let's just call our families. Say our goodbyes."

"Unless…" Zed stops, turning his eyes to me, his hand on his chin on his knee on the couch (fuck it, I'm wearing it with pride now).

"What?"

"We could call… *him*."

"You don't mean…"

"Yes I mean him." Zed gets up and takes three fast steps towards me, resting his hand on my shoulders.  "It's our only hope."

"Zed, he's an alien. Plus, it's too late, the Oscars start in two minutes."

"So? He can do it!"

"We can't put down a movie for Oscar consideration two minutes before the ceremony, Zed!"

"He can do it!" Zed roars. "You know he can!"

"It's too risky, Zed. We don't know what he's capable of."

"What other choice do we have!?"

Zed's eyes are locked on mine. Dead serious.

I sigh. "All right, then. Call him."

&nbsp;

One hour and forty minutes later, Zed and I are side by side on the couch, watching as Kate Mara finishes 
announcing the nominees for best actor in a lead role.

"It won't work," I say, quietly. "It won't work, not even *he* can pull this one out."

By my side, Zed watches in silence, his breath heavy and slow. Eyes locked on the screen.

And the Oscar goes to," Kate says, tearing the envelope open. "Leonardo Di –"

The applause starts, but stops at once as a man storms the stage. He whispers something in Kate's ear, then takes 
the envelope from her hand and gives her a second one, identical.

"We're very sorry," Kate says, in a hush. "But it looks like we have a sixth nominee." Clearing her throat, she tears 
the second envelope open. "Well… the Oscar goes to…" Her eyes go wide, and a smile crosses her face. "Matthew Mcconaughey, for 'Thirty Second Video Of Me Saying 'All Right, All Right, All Right' Uploaded To Youtube Just a Few Seconds Ago'"!

The winning music starts, and the camera switches to Leonardo DiCaprio's incredulous face. Zed jumps up in the 
air. "He did it! The motherfucker did it!"

I cry, getting up too and hugging Zed as we watch Matthew climbing up on the stage.

He takes the statue. Kisses Mara. Looks straight down at the first roll, frozen smile, eyes locked on Leo DiCaprio's face.

He raises the Oscar up in the air. Eyes still on Leo. 

Takes a deep breath. Widens his smile.

And says....

#### [WP] The Devil promises you everything: fame, fortune, all the things a mortal will ever need for paradise on earth. But he doesn't want your soul, he just wants you to take his socially awkward daughter, Gertrude, out on a date. Make her special, y'know?

Score: 1972

We sat quietly in the back of the boat while Charon slowly ferried us across the Acheron. Gertrude stared down at the waters below, where souls of the damned who couldn't afford the crossing were forever trapped in the muddy depths. She was really quite beautiful; not at all what I'd been expecting after Satan's offer. I mean, he'd promised me the world in exchange for taking her out on a date. I'd expected her to look... well, like him. Goat hooves and horns and red skin and everything. But she was just a normal girl. 

"So... you grew up here in Hell?" I asked.

Gertrude adjusted her glasses and shrank back like she was scared of the sound of my voice. "Yes," she answered meekly, then turned back to look at the water again. I rolled my eyes and checked my watch. This was going to be harder than I thought. 

---

"Well, I wanted to study marine biology," she said, picking at her pork chop, "But Daddy didn't want me to. Said that there's no water in Hell anyway except for the river. Water would give the damned hope, or something like that. I don't know."

"Why not just move away from Hell?"

Gertrude scoffed looked at me with a quivering smile. "Daddy would never let me do that. He tells me about all of the terrible things that you mortals do to each other and how they would kill and rape me as soon as I stepped out into the street alone. He says that Earth is a horrible place." 

*You are from HELL*, I wanted to tell her. *How could EARTH be worse than that?*

"It's really not that bad," I told her. "Sure, some people are bad, but it's only a few. You just see the worst of the worst because of, well, you know."

She took a sip of water and wiped her mouth. I had to admit, she had excellent manners; I'd expected an utter boor after meeting her dad. "I suppose that's true," she answered.

"You should try living here for a while. It seems like that's what you would want. You could get away from all that fire and brimstone and torture for a while. It's really quite pleasant! There's a lot to see!"

For a moment, she looked like she might cry. Then she went back to picking at her dinner.

"Daddy would never allow it."

---

After our meal, we went to the beach. I brought a blanket and candles and a bottle of wine. She was nervous as first, but as soon as she got her shoes off and dug her toes into the soft sand, she was a different person. Bubbly and friendly. She laughed and joked and I chased her through the surf until we both collapsed into the sand, completely out of breath. It was almost hard to believe that this is the same person I'd picked up from Hell only a few hours ago.

"You've really never been to the sea before?" I asked her.

She gazed out at the waves. "No," she said. "I've only read about it. Daddy doesn't let me out very much." She bit her top lip, and I thought I saw a tear. Maybe it was just ocean spray. "It's beautiful though. Better than I ever imagined. Thank you for bringing me."

She turned to me and planted a kiss on my lips. I don't know which one of us was more surprised; she shrank back like I was a snake and covered her mouth with her hands. Her eyes were wide with shock.

"I'm sorry!" she uttered. "I would never normally do that!"

I laughed, pulled her hand away, and kissed her again.

----

I returned to hell around midnight. Satan greeted me at the gate. 

"I did it," I told him. "I took her out, and we had a lovely time."

He nodded. "Good. She's been getting restless in here; I had to do something. Hopefully this will keep her satisfied for a few hundred years."

I stayed silent.

"Well, name your price. Whatever you want."

I smiled. "I already got what I want. I only came back to let you know that we're all settled up. Thanks for everything, sir."

I turned and left. Only then did Satan notice that Gertrude hadn't returned to Hell with me. She was waiting back at my apartment.

#### [WP] God created thousands of worlds in thousands of galaxies. A major crisis in another galaxy has taken his entire focus, and for the first time in 750 years, he just glanced in our direction.

Score: 1959

It wasn't all perfect, it had taken a few tries.  Free will can be a double edged sword sometimes.

But by and large the last few billion years have gone by without a hitch.  Watching his children learn to harness the power of the universe, explore, meet and share was one of his greatest pleasures.

In the end it boiled down to simplicity- The same small number of rules codified in each civilization did the trick.  Whether you lived in a gas giant or in the vacuum of space, 10 basic rules are really all you needed.

Unfortunately a couple millennium ago a small planet forgot the basic rules.  It started with the idea of holding material goods and wealth as a higher God than him.  "That's kinda why I put that in there!  I don't care which version of me you worship, that's fine.  Just understand stupid stuff like minerals and worldly goods doesn't come before respecting my universe".

It truly hurt his heart to deal with the crisis.  It started off with a single taking of life of a fellow sentient over some chunk of gold.  Gold- he could literally make more for them- or they can go get more, the universe is full of it!  Then another taking of life a few hundred years later.  By the time nearly 2000 years had passed the species had managed to kill literally dozens of their own race.

He didn't understand it- Thou Shall Not Kill.  How much simpler could it get?  

The images haunted him- dozens of bodies, dozens of families left crushed.  How could he let this happen?  What the hell was wrong with them that they thought this was ok?  Why would they feel it's acceptable to literally have a murder or two every century, almost like clockwork?  

He was wary with that senseless loss of his beloved children.  He closed his eyes and played back each of their lives, and the dozens of children they left behind or were going to leave behind.  The gaps in the tapestry of his plan were small (it was only a few dozen threads), but he could feel it, he could see it, and it pained him so deeply.

With a sigh he finally turned his attention back to another part of his creation.

"Ahh, Eden!", he thought.  "This should cheer me up.  Beautiful and clever little children I made there.  Let's see how they are doing over there in the Milky Way."

#### [WP] Your roommate is 2nd most powerful superhero in the world and he will not shut up about it. He does not yet know that you are the 1st.

Score: 1957

I never understood why every superhero out there wore capes. I swear, the amount of raw fabric he goes through must be inversely proportionally to his IQ. My roommate is the self proclaimed "Second Most Powerful Hero to ever live." Never mind he hasn't ever faced off against any truly powerful super villain. Those were taken care of years upon years ago. 

Let's break it down. Ryan, my roommate, has; heat vision, frost breath, super strength, skin that can stop bullets and lasers, the ability to breathe in space, and a laundry list of other abilities. He's made me time him flying to the moon and back. Usually I don't have time to press the stop watch. He's all hot air. Well, unless you put these funny green or red rocks near him. Something to do with his home world and all that. 

I digress. Today has been strange indeed. He's insisted, once again that I time him. Something about wanting to feel his ranking. I kind of tune him out when he starts going on these rants about his powers. I just kind of tick on my fingers the ones that he's listed. More than anything I just want to tell him to shut up most of the time. However, I really can't. You see, I have a certain ability. An ability that makes the world a much better place than anyone can dream of. Day in and day out I save the world over and over again from a threat that's possibly strong enough to destroy the universe. I keep the idiots in the world cloaked in their own little bubbles. No supervillian has risen in my lifetime, nor will any. 

If you haven't guessed yet. I am the most powerful superhero in existence. Not because of the powers I have, but because of what I do. I keep the biggest, most powerful idiot in existence, well, entertained. Well, that, and I can make a lot of copies of myself. So, for every hero that's out there I'm there. I'm watching them all drone on about being number two. After all, no one is more dangerous than someone with something to prove. However, when you're proving it to someone that doesn't care then the world is a much better place. 

Edit: Obligatory thanks for the gold.

#### [WP] In the year 2066, aliens invade Earth. Thanks to a few brave individuals, we steal the secret to time travel, and send back one intrepid person to spark a war so vicious that human weapons technology will be advanced enough in 2066 to take on the alien threat. His name: Adolph Hitler.

Score: 1941

Mortars thud outside the bunker, and I remove my cybernetic enhancements and crush them beneath my boot heel. I can leave no trace of my true origins; that could ruin everything I have built. I am a stone, sinking to the bottom of the pond. But I have made my ripples in time, and that is enough. Regardless of how history remembers me, my job is done. And in only twenty one years! Far ahead of schedule.

I die a monster. I know that. The world will forever spit at the mention of my name. Exactly as my commanding officer told me when he ordered me into the tachyon displacement field and sent me more than a century back. "You have to prepare us," he gasped, nursing the shard of steel impaled in his side. He handed me the folder that was meant for him, full of schematics for jets and rockets and a political analysis of Europe. "You need to prevent the German Dissolution of 1941 and ensure a world-wide military buildup. It's all in the briefing. *Do what must be done*." Without waiting for a response, he closed the shield door and turned on the machine. I watched helplessly through the thick porthole as the brick walls disintegrated and the Hunters burst in and tore him to shreds. They were too late to stop me, though.

I rushed it, and almost ruined everything. They now call it the "Beer Hall Putsch." My first attempt at seizing the government, and it failed miserably. But I was not one to give up, knowing that the Hunter fleet was already on its way. I redoubled my efforts, building a political network from inside prison walls and writing my propaganda masterpiece. I watched the Weimar Republic edge closer and closer to its own destruction, knowing full well that it would end with the death of German industry, extending the world's economic depression and stunting scientific development for the next fifty years. It needed to be prevented at all costs.

I was able to seize control, building a cult of personality around myself and brainwashing Germany's citizens. I rebuilt the economy and began pouring investments into the military. Certain scientists were entrusted with the schematics that I had brought back and began to develop a number of useful weapons. Missiles, jet engines, computing machines, harnessing the power of the atom... it would soon come to fruition. The Hunters' own weapons would be turned against them.

I was naive enough to believe that the world would let me build my army in peace, but I was at the very least adaptable. The British, weak-willed and isolationist in my own time, were (to my surprise) amazingly resilient and stubborn. I only wish that this "Winston Churchill" had been born a century later. I should have liked to hear the speech he would give when the Hunters took up positions in our orbit.

When I saw the stormclouds of war on the horizon, I used it to my advantage. Germany may burn, but I would ensure that the rest of the world carried on my vision, even if they didn't know it. I fanned the flames of distrust between the Soviets and the Americans, starting with the joint German/USSR invasion of Poland. I ordered my most trusted weapons engineers out of the country, telling them to make it look like they were defecting. Their research was too precious to keep here, knowing that the other nations of the world would soon make me a target. And I whispered into the ear of my new Japanese allies, urging them ever onward. In my own timeline, their territorial ambitions had stopped at Korea and they became peaceful (albeit weird) citizens of the world.

There were casualties, of course. My own German soldiers, and the many citizens of my conquered nations. All pawns in a giant game of chess, and sometimes sacrifices must be made. It broke my heart to give the order, but I instituted full-scale persecution of the Jews. They were the only logical target. Their culture is built on a history of persecution and insecurity, and I was the straw that broke the camel's back. Their leaders, spiritied away to newly-established Israel, vowed never to be left defenseless again. Their Irgun forces are ruthless and efficient, just as I'd hoped. My agents in Palestine are already setting the ground work for a lasting conflict there to ensure that the Middle East will be embroiled in war for at least a decade.

My time now is at an end, and I see the fruits of my labor around the world. Rocket-powered planes are under development in nations across the world. The United States is adapting my own V2 designs now, and they'll probably make it to space within the next decade or two. The Atomic Bomb, the heart of our dream arsenal against the Hunters, is ready for use. And best of all, I can already see the tensions forming between the allies. Russians and Americans vying for territory, carving out their own spheres of influence. The next few decades will be fraught with danger and peril, but humans will emerge ready for the true test of their valor: when the Hunter fleet emerges from the shadows. I can only imagine what terrifying weapons of war we will have available by then.

I can hear the thumping on the door of the bunker now, and I prepare to take my own life. I burn the folder in front of me, detailing the journey of U-815 into Antarctica. If I leave any evidence of this submarine, the Americans and Russians will sink it and leave it at the bottom of the sea. I've planted a final gift for the Hunters deep under the ice, set to emerge in 2066. My scientists never understood why I wanted to create this, but they did as they were told. An engineered virus, specifically targeting Hunter physiology. Humans will be completely immune. I've left a message in the cannisters, detailing all of my plans and what I knew. Maybe someday, I'll be recognized as a savior.

With that last pleasant thought in my mind, I load the gun and put the barrel against my temple.

#### [EU] For generations, Hogwarts students have been divided into four houses. As you sit beneath the Sorting Hat, you become the first student chosen for a mysterious fifth house.

Score: 1940

"My word," the Hat said. "What a peculiar mind.  I certainly do love a challenge! Let's see what we have to work with here. Smart, certainly. But you're not the Ravenclaw type. They care only for books and spells, not creativity and ingenuity. Hufflepuff is a possibility; you seem like a fine fellow. But there's a vein of courage and pride that dear Helga would not have approved of. No, no: that's Gryffindor's expertise."

My eyes lit up as he said Gryffindor, and the front row of the Great Hall tensed up as if expecting the announcement to come soon. Everyone wanted to be in Gryffindor; that was the house of Harry and Hermoine and Ron! 

"They'd certainly love to have you, I'm sure. But I don't think it would be the right fit. You seem to be more cautious and calculating than some of those headstrong lugs. Slytherin, perhaps? I think not; I don't sense the manipulative ambition in you. You have pride, but not arrogance. You have desire, but not greed. My my, a strange specimen indeed."

Headmistress Chang was beginning to get impatient; she glanced at the gold pocketwatch in her hand and smiled reassuringly at me. 

The deliberation continued for half an hour. A cluster of teachers had gathered in a corner, whispering in hushed tones and occasionally glancing back at the stage. I could tell that they were trying to guess if something was wrong with me. 

*Maybe there's no place for me,* I thought, panicking just a bit. *Maybe they'll send me home and tell me to try Durmstrang instead.*

Just as Headmistress Chang stood from the table and made her way onto the stage, the hat cried out. Everyone in the room perked up; I think some people had assumed it fell asleep on my head or something.

"AHAH!" it shouted with a cackle that echoed through the enormous hall. "I've got it!" 

Headmaster Chang retreated a bit.

"AMBARET!" the hat announced.

The hall was silent; the other students weren't sure if they should clap or not. He hadn't said one of the houses. Headmaster Chang, however seemed to know what that meant. She let out a tiny whisper: "Oh my..."

“Ostrich”, they said. Ostrich. “No way ostrich is coming up in a drug deal”.

No one mentioned the idiot had an ostrich.

A. Freaking. Ostrich. 

Who has a pet ostrich?

Eccentric cocaine dealers, that's who.

That's why Morelo asked me, “What are you talking about?” when I said the money was “right there, by the big 
dove”.

“Have you never seen an ostrich before?” He asks now, because who the hell calls an ostrich 'the big dove'?

This idiot, that's who.

“Oh, that's an ostr – that's what that is?” I reply, and my asshole clenches so tight it could cut a number 2 pencil in 
half.

“Scott, you're telling me this is the first time you see an ostrich?” Asks him, the golden chains clinking as he walks 
my way.

I say the word ostrich and this place is run down by a SWAT team faster than you can say... well, ostrich. But he 
doesn't know that, of course. To him, ostrich is just his freaking pet.

What's wrong with having a golden retriever, for God's sake?

“I thought they were called Emus." I smile. He does not.

“Jesse is not an emu. She's an ostrich. Understood?”

“The money is right by Jesse's side, on my briefcase.”

“Emus suck. Don't you agree?”

“I do, I do.”

“You know what's better than emus?”

“Jesse?”

“OSTRICHES! Do you understand?”

I'm pretty sure I soiled myself right about there.

“I do. I do. Can we just make the transaction, Mr. Morelo?”

“What is Jesse, Scott?”

“What?” 

I don't have a gun. A SWAT team storms this hotel room, exchanging fire with these dealers, and I'm like a 
bleached asshole in the middle of a dick and cock mingle.

Meaning I'm fucked.

“Jesse. Is. Not. An. Emu. Do you understand?”

“I do, Mr. Morelo. Very much so. Let's just make the trade, ok?”

“No.” He waves to his guys, “Bring me Jesse.”

Have you ever seen an ostrich walking across a hotel room filled with cocaine, money and drug dealers while trying 
to stop yourself from crying like a bitch and silently calculating the escape route of a building?

I have.

“Pet her.”

I pet the fucker.

“Tell me. Is this an Emu?”

“No, sir, it's not.” It's an ostrich.

“What is this?”

Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

“It's an... ostrich. Fuck it, it's an ostrich! Ostrich! Ostrich! They have guns! OSTRICH, OSTRICH, OSTRICH!”

Nothing. And, of course, they look at me like I'm crazy.

“Ostrich!”

“What are you doing?” Morelo asks, but it's just to be polite, seeing as his partner is already unbuttoning my shirt 
and has found the recorder, and the guns are already pointed at me.

“OSTRICH! What the fuck? Ostrich!”

And just as the guns are cocked, I remember.

Alpaca. It was alpaca. Not ostrich.

Alpaca.

Why did I think it was ostrich?

“Shoot him.”

I could have said 'alpaca' before they opened fire. I don't know why I didn't. If I had to take a guess, I'd say it's 
cause I thought I deserved it, in a way.

*I'm gonna die because of alpacas and ostriches, I think, as Jesse stares at me from above. Is this blood on my shirt? Who messes up alpacas for ostriches, anyway?*

#### [WP] "What do you mean the robbers ADDED $4,000,000 to the vault?"

Score: 1934

The two men ducked under the yellow police tape and peered through the heavy steel bars blocking the way to the vault. The damage was obvious even from this distance: the entire back wall had been reduced to rubble by heavy explosives, and a dark tunnel led underground. Following the tunnel would eventually lead to the bottom of Mr Singer's old tailor's shop, which hadn't been open for more than a year now after Mr. Singer's passing. According to the agents, no one had reported seeing anyone go in or out in the past few months, but *someone* had to have dug the tunnel. 

"How much was the count again?" Agent Rodriguez asked. He looked every bit the FBI agent: tall and handsome, with a powerful jaw and stunning straight teeth. His black hair was cropped close in a buzz cut, and he had just the right amount of stubble dusted across his chin. He wore a dark suit, crisply starched shirt, a power tie, and even some heavily tinted aviator sunglasses. But his face seemed permanently set in a dour grimace; probably because we'd spent all of our time together inspecting this absurd crime scene. If you could even call it that. Was it a crime if the robbers had *given* you money?

"Last count on Friday showed that the vault contained 11.7 million in cash and other 1.9 million in bearer bonds," I told him. I'd done the count myself; I knew it was accurate. "Plus whatever is here in the safety deposit boxes. As far as we can tell, none of them were opened. Doesn't look like any damage was done to them, and they were all..."

"Don't count on it," Agent Lewis interrupted me. He leaned over, trying to see the safety deposit boxes through the bars. "If they weren't after the cash, then there has to be something else missing. We're going to need to go through an inventory of those and make sure that everything is still inside."

I gulped; it felt like I was trying to swallow a rock. A rock the size of my fist. "Yes sir," I meekly answered.

"The count?" Rodriguez asked with a dash of annoyance. "Don't get sidetracked, darlin'." That word really emphasized his Texan drawl. "You said they *added* cash to the shelves?"

"Yes, sir." I unlocked the gate and led them into the vault, where the mystery pallet sat right next to the others, still on a handcart. A cart that didn't belong to the bank, mind you. "Another 4 million dollars in cash. Sequential serial numbers..." I pointed to the numbers visible through the plastic wrapping. "Hell, it looks like it's never even been touched!"

Agent Lewis removed a Swiss army knife from his pocket and sliced through the plastic wrapping on the pallet. He lifted a stack of hundreds and held it up to eye level. For the first time, he removed his sunglasses, revealing piercing blue eyes. He studied the bills closely, flipping through the stack like a picture book and examining the detailed watermarks. He even sniffed them. 

"Ink's off," he told Rodriguez. "It's a pretty good fake, but definitely counterfeit. These guys are fucking pros."

I nearly smacked myself in the head. Counterfeit, of course! I hadn't even thought of that. I must have made a sound or something, because Rodriguez turned to me with a sympathetic smile. "Yeah, it's hard to tell. Almost looks legit, don't it?" 

I nodded. The bills in his hand did look real, and I'd been working at this bank for the past decade.

"They're trying to get the counterfeits into circulation," he said. 

"Why leave *more* than we had originally, though?" I asked. "What's the profit in that?"

The two agents looked at each other. "Well, we're not sure how much legitimate currency you've got left here. we're going to have to have a look around," Rodriguez finally answered. "Particularly at those safe deposit boxes. You mind fetchin' the key sets for us?"

I did as I was told and returned to the vault to remove the safety deposit boxes. One by one, I extracted the metal containers from the secured cabinet and placed them on the table, where the agents inspected them for any external damage. "We're going to need the customer keys to open them," I told the agents. 

"Of course," Lewis growled. He shot me a 'does this look like my first rodeo' look and rolled his eyes. "So why don't you get us that list of customers so that we can contact them?" 

I printed out a list from the bank's records and brought it to the agents. They'd finished inspecting the safety deposit boxes and were currently flipping through stacks of bills that were already on our shelves. They were placing them into two piles: one for 'real,' and one for 'counterfeit.' At least, that's what I assumed.

"That's all, ma'am," Lewis said, looking up at me. "You can get back to your work. We'll let you know when we need something else."

I tried to avoid his cold gaze. At least Agent Rodriguez had a smile for me. "All right then." I returned back to my office to finish filling out the paperwork for the insurance claim. I didn't quite know how to fill in the "Lost assets" column, though. What a weird case.

Sheriff Denton entered with his normal slow shuffle. "Afternoon, Margaret," he told me. He was nearly 70, but the town kept electing him Sheriff as kind of a thank you for all his past service. There wasn't much crime here anyway, and his deputies were all young and fit so no one really saw the harm.

"Sheriff," I nodded to him. "How are you?"

"Oh, fine," he said with a child-like grin. "Back to collect some more evidence. Not every day that we get a bank robbery around these parts! Exciting, isn't it?"

I shrugged. I found it rather terrifying, but then again it was my bank. "If you're here to help with the investigation, the two FBI agents are in the vault doing their investigation now." I leaned in close and whispered, though there was no real reason to given that the bank was empty. "Get this, Sheriff: they think the bills were *counterfeit*."

Sheriff Denton seemed puzzled. "We... haven't called the FBI..." he told me slowly.

-----

The vault was empty. The handtruck with the pallet of counterfeit bills had disappeared, as had the pallets of *actual* bills, along with a good number of the safety deposit boxes and the list of their owners' names and addresses. The only sign that the Rodriguez and Lewis had ever been there was twin sets of footprints in the dust and rubble leading into the dark tunnel.

#### [WP] Thor is sitting at a diner finishing a meal. A waitress comes by and casually picks up Mjolnir to wipe off the table.

Score: 1929

"Brother, I do not see why you bother with these mortal establishments." Loki whispered in a disdainful voice. "We could be feasting in the halls of our father with endless servants loading our plates with freshly roasted boar. Rather than these... what are these?"

"They are called pancakes. I'm quite fond of them, here try this." Thor reached over and grasped the syrup and poured it over the circular cakes, filling the edges of the plate and dripping over the side.

Loki narrowed his eyes in suspicion. "Go on. Try it. Does the god of tricks fear being tricked?" Loki took his fork and stabbed into the pancake, cut off a small perfect square and ate only a single bite. He crewed, examining the flavor and texture in his mouth.

He did not communicate pleasure, but he ate the rest of the square and began eating the rest of the meal. Thor had brought Loki to so many little inconspicuous ventures that the humans had. This was Thor's part in Loki's rehabilitation. Odin had ordered Loki to go and find what made the humans froth forward to the joys of life. Thor was there just to make sure he actually experienced something and did not try anything as foolish as escape.

To mortals, they looked like average truckers. Mjolnir sat next to Loki's plate getting syrup spilled under it, the hammer would not allow itself to be contaminated.

The friendly woman who served them came back over. "Hey guys, how're the pancakes?"

"They are delightful, thank you." Thor spoke through a smile.

"They are... acceptable." Loki surprisingly blurted out.

"So, I was wondering is there a con in town?"

"Excuse me?" Thor said "What is a con?"

"A con... a convention? I thought you two would be going to one dressed like that."

"Dressed like what?"

"In armor, and all that, you look a bit like that Thor fella. Is that who you are dressed as?"

Loki slowly looked up at the woman. His tricks fooled gods most of the time, but here was a mortal seeing right through one of his most powerful disguises.

While Thor and Loki stared blankly at her in surprise, she looked down at the table and noticed the syrup slowly flowing to the edge and threatening to leap to the ground.

She grabbed her rag, "Oh, so sorry for this mess." She began wiping the table. Loki and Thor met eyes and shook their heads in wonder. The waitress wiped the syrup back to the plate and reached for the hammer to clean under it. Thor instinctively reached out to stop her, but the woman picked it up as if it were nothing and wiped underneath it.

Thor looked up, once again at the woman who smiled back at him.

"Y'all are kind of quiet. But you're welcome."

"And I thank you. Sorry for any rudeness. May I ask, what is your name?"

"Oh." She said, she pointed to her nametag. "The name is Hebe."

"That is an unusual name." Loki said, inspecting this newly interesting woman.

"Its an old greek name. Anyway, hope you guys have fun with whatever you're doing. I got more people to serve."

And with that, she walked away. "See Loki. The mortals aren't always so boring."

"And I was just beginning to find pancakes intriguing."

Score: 1920

I stand over my most recent kill and *finally* feel the level up course through my body. 

How many has it been? A thousand? Ten thousand? 
They all blur together. 

Looking down at my Timberlands I realize I'm standing a pool of her still-warm blood. I crouch down and dip the tip of my forefinger in, swirling it around a little. Tiny bits of grass and dirt from the frozen field we stand in mix and spin around on the surface. Dipping and falling into the tiny whirlpool I created. 

I raise my hand towards my face, the blood's scent tickling my olfactory. The compulsion to taste it is so strong I can't stop myself. 

Blood is blood is blood. The taste is much like my own.  Although there are some slight differences that I can't quite put my finger on. 

She didn't have any riches or weapons to plunder, but I can still take her skin. Putting away my hatchet, I pull out my field knife and begin the work. It's a dirty job, but moves quickly after the first thousand. 

I am so fucking tired of killing boars.

#### [WP] The entire Star Wars series, all 7 movies, are released as one book, written by Dr. Seuss.

Score: 1907

A long time ago, and so far far away,

There was a rebellion in space, so they say!

That old Evil Empire was up to no good

They kidnapped a princess, you knew that they would!

And then with the might only money can buy,

They set out to make a Death Star, in the sky!

That dastardly Emperor!

That Scoundrel! That Fiend!

Could nobody stop him? Would no one intervene? 


But the princess was crafty - and with luck she escaped! 

SHE wasn't held back by a bit of a scrape!

Though she didn't get far, she did get far enough

And she sent out a droid with a message - times were rough!

Though she knew that her plan had no chance of success,

It was all she could do - A New Hope, for the rest


And as luck would have it, her plans met with a teen

They flew all the way down to the planet, Tatooine! 

When Luke picked them up, he had no way to tell

That this was the start of his personal hell


He went to a master - a man named Old Ben

And in fear for his family, he went home again!

But when he arrived, he found they all died

So with nothing to hold him, to the stars he did fly!


Soon they met with a smuggler, a man named Solo

He said he could take them where they had to go!

But while flying along on their journey to space

Old Obi Wan feels something - pain across his face!

"I sense a disturbance" He said with no doubt

"As if hundreds of people had suddenly cried out

And then they were silent - I do not like this" 

Luke looked on in horror, he knew something's amiss

"Wait, that's no moon! It's a space station!" he said with a hiss!


Before they knew it, and before they could react

They were suddenly captured - they were under attack!

Though they managed to hide, in the smuggler's den

They had no way to escape - they were trapped in a pen!


"I'll disable the beam, you distract the guards

I have unfinished business aboard this Death Star"

Old Ben was Kenobi, a Jedi Knight supreme

And he could feel Vader on board, like a dream



They fought and they ran, sneaking between the guards

It seemed that victory was here - luck in their cards!

And with the princess they managed to escape

"But wait, that was too easy - it had to be fake!" 

"Too easy - you're joking, that was incredibly hard!

And Old Ben got killed! Our victory's marred!

Despite her objections, they went on their way

Down to the rebel base, to enter the fray!

But Leia was right - it had been a trap!

The were tracked to the base! The rebellion was scrap!

"If we don't hurry, soon they'll kill us all! 

But look at these plans - we can blow up that ball!

We'll need pilots with skill, we'll need pilots with grace

To fire proton torpedoes, right here, at this place!

This mission is hard - without doubt, some will die

But it is our only hope - so fly pilots, fly!"


And so Luke joined their ranks, and he jumped in a ship

To fly down a trench - pray a wing doesn't clip!

And though many were killed - in fact, most happened to die

Luke made it to the end - and his torpedoes did fly!

He shot without computer, Someone said "Use the Force!"

And with that mysterious power, he struck at the source!

With luck and with skill, sacrifice and Hope,

The Death Star exploded - Luke's a hero! Don't mope!

From farm boy to Jedi, an unknown to the best

Luke's journey wasn't over - it's just the start of his quest!

#### [WP]Serial killer has been monitoring his next victim's movements for months. She is a loner and the perfect target. One day she disappears and nobody notices but him.

Score: 1895

* March 17: #15 has been disposed of without complication. It seems the police have begun to piece together the connections between #1, #2, and #4. Was too sloppy in the beginning. Stupid. But what's done is done, no use worrying about it now. Will have to monitor their investigation and reevaluate at a later date. But for now, a few weeks of relaxation.

* April 3: The itch is back. Can no longer hear #15's scream as clearly in my mind. Recordings just are not the same. Time to find another. Maybe around where #7 worked, that seemed like a spot with good potential.

* April 5: No luck yet. Good targets but too much activity. Must be especially careful now, as the police are making progress. What they will call me? Will check around #11's parents' neighborhood tomorrow.

* April 9: One target with maximum potential. Mid-thirties, average build, brunette. Smells like a summer breeze. Never has any company, no association with immediate neighbors. Spends hours watering hydrangeas in her garden. Must continue reconnaissance, ensure there are no surprises.

* April 17: Confirmed target has no contact with #11's parents, good. The police have figured out that #4 worked at the same place as #9. Perhaps too risky to have done that...but #9 was worth it. So very worth it.

* April 30: Living situation optimal. Only ever leaves house to go to work, the grocery store, and the library. Avid science fiction reader. On an Asimov binge currently. Also grows fruits in the backyard. Tasty. Time to track movements more precisely.

* May 14: Two week schedule complete. Very few deviations from established norms. Barely acknowledges employees in either the grocery store or the library. Keeps head down at work. Will not be missed when gone.

* May 16: Police found #9's body. Of all the bodies to find, it had to be #9's. Knew it. Should have disposed of it more completely. But could not. Not #9.

* May 22: Can predict target's every move; reconnaissance complete. Time to perform extensive background check, make sure there are no random links for the police to find.

* May 28: Seems to be clean. Complications, however. #11's parents spoke to the police and now the neighborhood is crawling with obstacles. Will have to delay action until the presence has dissipated.

* June 6: Police have concluded that #11 is a dead-end. Precision does pay off. Target's patterns have not changed in the interim. By this time tomorrow, target will officially be #16.

* June 7: Plans on halt. #9's funeral is today. Cannot resist urge to attend. #16 will have to wait one more day.

* June 8: #16...is gone. Only left to attend #9's funeral for a matter of hours. #9 looked as beautiful as always. But #16 is gone. Car left in the driveway, hydrangeas unwatered in the garden, front door locked. Does not make sense. Must be patient. Must make sense of situation.

* June 11: Still no sign of #16. No activity around house whatsoever. Did not show up for work. No books from the library. No groceries from the store. Disappeared without a trace.

* June 18: Mystery is unbearable. Two months of flawless consistency, broken. Same day as #9's funeral, #16 disappears. Does not make sense. Can not make sense.

* June 21: No one misses #16. No one even notices the absence. As if #16 never existed at all. But #16 did exist. #16 watered hydrangeas. Hydrangeas are now dead. Where is #16?

* June 25: Should simply find another target, forget about #16. Police have given up on the case after #9's funeral. No chance of being caught unless a mistake is made. Trying to find #16 would be a mistake. But #16 was perfect. Perfect.

* June 29: Saw movement within #16's house today. Must check it out. Must figure out what happened to #16. Must solve the mystery.

"Do you really think this is going to work, Grady?"

"Have a little faith, Holt. I know how this guy thinks. He won't give up until he finds Miss Riley."

"But we moved her three weeks ago, and nothing's happened yet. Why would us coming in here change that?"

"I'll bet you twenty bucks that he's watching the house right now."

"Deal. You're gonna be out--"

Suddenly, the door slid open with a squeak. Both officers sprang to their feet, their pistols trained squarely on the intruder's head.

"Stupid. Careless. Too curious. Should never have..." the man mumbled to himself.

"Check it out, Holt. You owe me twenty bucks."

#### [WP] A peaceful alien race is besieged by another race in the same galaxy. As their last planets fall and their home-world comes under threat they do the unthinkable. They ask for aid from the only known creatures more brutal than their foes in exchange for FTL technology. Humans accept the deal.

Score: 1893

We'd kept them locked up around Sol for over three centuries. Watching their civilization was like studying cancer through a microscope. First one planet colonized. Then two. Then four. Then eight. Growing, and growing, and growing, swarming over moons and through gas giants. Destroying everything in its path. Burning through resources as though tomorrow would never come. And killing its host: Earth itself had become a mined-out husk, and Mars was on its way to the same fate.

Our strategy had been containment. Every probe and ship sent out was destroyed as soon as it emerged from the Oort cloud. We didn't like the idea, but it was better than humans overrunning every other peaceful system in the galaxy. We were doctors, stopping the cancer from infecting the rest of galaxy. Sometimes, though, it just felt like we were throwing rocks at a beehive. The number of probes continued to grow. Sol was a swollen tumor, ready to burst. And if they ever discovered who had really stopped those probes...

But that is all in the past. In the end, it turned out that the humans were the lesser of evils. The Kahi cut through us like a knife, seizing our homeworld in less than a year. Getting cancer doesn't seem so bad when you're already dying of stab wounds, right? Hell, maybe it could even help.

The humans seemed so shocked when we landed. After all those years of imagining what aliens were like in their movies, they hadn't even come close to picturing it. I still remember the ship door opening to the sight of gun barrels. Typical humans. "I come in peace," I'd told them (well, my computer did, at least), in perfect English. That's what they would have wanted; those movies sure are helpful.

I presented my terms to the United Nations Congress. Technological aid, weapons, maps of the universe, and all sorts of other benefits. I even pointed them right to a great star system that they would love, full of arable land and fishable seas. Conveniently near the Kahi colonies... 

Did they know they were being played? Possibly. Maybe they just didn't care. They offered me and the remnants of my civilization shelter, living in their polar regions. Antarctica was the perfect climate for my people. And they didn't seem to like it very much anyway. It was just the right size for what remained of our species. 

When they encountered the Kahi, it was a bloodbath. Dozens of worlds lost at once. World leaders pounded their fists and demanded retribution. The great docks in orbit churned to life, pouring out starships like they were baking cookies. Even as I was revolted at the way they chewed through their own asteroid belt for resources, I was impressed at their resolve and determination. They asked if we knew of these Kahi; we told them only barely. Just enough to tell them all about their technology and physiology; everything they would need to carry on a war. Perhaps they will discover our lie when they find the ruins of our homeworld; perhaps not. But they are not wrathful enough to massacre us because of a tiny lie. They'll rant and they'll rage, and maybe expel us from our new city in Antarctica. It won't really matter; at least we'll be able to go home.

Score: 1890

"Two words," Congressman Richards said slowly and emphatically, never breaking eye contact with Congressman Powell, the committee chairman. "*Chainsaw fingers.*"

"Oh, fuck yeah!" Powell answered, scribbling more onto the whiteboard in the center of the hearing room that I'd brought to outline my plan. The pages with my detailed schematics had been torn down and thrown onto the floor, and a rough sketch of a humanoid robot had taken its place. Powell even took the time to add "BRRRR" comment bubbles next to the crude depictions of chainsaws. 

"No, no," Congresswoman Pearson butted in. "*Laser* chainsaw fingers!"

"That doesn't even make sense!" I shouted. No one even heard me. Richards was too busy high-fiving Pearson, and Powell was drawing lasers coming out of each tooth of the chainsaw fingers, complete with "pew pew!" comment bubbles. "Look, if we can just take another glance at my original designs," I pleaded, "I think you'll find it much more feasible, OK? The shore of the Pacific stretches for hundreds of thousands of miles. Even assuming a top speed of a few hundred miles per hour that would allow them to cover long stretches of coastline, the amount of robots we'd need to guard it is *astronomical!*"

"You're right," Congresswoman Davis addressed me. She'd stayed silent for most of the hearing now, and I had really been counting on her to be the voice of reason in the room. Her home district north of Seattle had been utterly ravaged by a 12-limbed Category 3 (on the Serizawa scale) only six months ago. "You're absolutely right." 

"Thank you. Now, if you'll lo..."

"We need *MORE* robots!" Davis announced loudly to the others. "Like, a hundred times more robots!"

"No!" I cried out. "No, damn it! Not robots! Look, we know that they're all coming from one specific vent in the Pacific, right? Now, the most sensible alterna..."

"How about nunchucks?" Pearson butted in again. "Those are pretty bad-ass!"

"Oh, or throwing stars!" Davis added. "Like, giant ones! Throwing stars bigger than a fucking car!"

"This isn't the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, OK?" I screamed into the microphone. "These are dangerous beasts that have already killed hundreds of thousands of people, and there's another one scheduled to make landfall on Okinawa in less than an hour!" How the hell were we able to get our shit together and create a Pacific-wide sonar system to track a few Soviet subs, but our representatives turned into twelve-year-old anime-obsessed boys when it came down to fighting gigantic hellbeasts? "Now, look. Between the United States, Russia, China, and Europe, there are over 10,000 stockpiled nuclear weapons currently just sitting around. Our early detection systems would allow us to send a nuclear-tipped torpedo within minutes whenever a new Kaiju...."

"Bros, what about flamethrowers?" Congressman Richards interrupted. He hadn't heard a single word I said.

"They fight *in water*!" I shouted back. "WATER!! And we already tried that in Canberra, remember? Where we burned down most of the city with napalm and it didn't even affect a Category 2???" I was slamming my hand on the polished wooden desk for emphasis, hoping that if even if my *words* couldn't get their attention, maybe any loud noise would. 

There was a stunned silence in the room for just a moment, and then Congressman Pearson spoke. "Well, yeah... but it would *look* super cool!" The other representatives all nodded and agreed that it would indeed look awesome. 

I threw my hands into the air. "You know what? Fuck it. Why don't we just make a giant flaming chain that will solidify into a massive sword so that we can *behead* Kaiju?" I spouted off the first absurd thing to come into my mind. 

There was another stunned silence. "That... would be... *AWESOME!*" Davis finally shouted. Powell was already jumping around the room, pretending to be slicing at invisible Kaiju with his sharpie as a sword. 

I got up from my chair and began collecting my carefully-drawn plans from the floor as they turned towards debating what to name the robots. Congresswoman Davis proposed "Killerbots," while Congressman Richards favored "Murder Machines."

The door flew open, and another dumbass Congressman in a black suit with a flag lapel pin strolled in with a bottle in hand. "Sorry I missed the meeting, bros! I was getting a bit *tipsay!*" He waved the bottle around illustratively. "Anyone want some Jäger??"

The representatives all traded looks, then simultaneously all shouted the same thing: "DUDE!!!"

"Listen guys," Archer said to his captors.  "I think we can both agree that this was a pretty understandable mix-up.  When I heard there was an ISIS safe house nearby, I thought-"

One of the terrorists jammed the barrel of his AK-47 in Archer's face, held out a phone, and gave instructions in Arabic.  

"Uh.... sorry," Archer said.  "I don't-"

"Speak Arabic," Lana interrupted.  "Because you completely blew off the 8 week Arabic course that all ISIS members are required to take."

"I don't think they need to take an Arabic course, Lana.  They already speak it."

"Not this ISIS, dumbass.  Our ISIS!  The spy agency!  Not the terrorists, to who you've delivered us."

"One," Archer said, holding up a finger.  "ISIS safehouse can mean a lot of different things.  Two," he said holding up another finger, "I'm having a hard enough time thinking straight because it's impossible to find a drink in this part of the world.  And three, whom."

"What?"

"Whom.  The terrorists to whom I've delivered us.  You said it wrong."

"Archer, I-"

The ISIS member interrupted Lana by shouting and waving the phone.

"He wants you to call ISIS."

"But we're already-"

"Our ISIS!  We're being ransomed."

"God, Mother is not going to like this."  Archer dialed, but nobody answered.  A moment later, the phone rang on its own.

"What am I paying you for if you can't even answer a phone?!" Mallorie screamed on the other end as Archer answered.

In the background, they could hear Cheryl yelling back, "I thought I had put it on speaker!"

"Oh, thank God," Archer said.  "Lana and I are being held hostage by ISIS.  And no, it's not our ISIS.  It's the other ISIS.  The one that probably stands for... um... Irritating Shitheads In.... Syria... or something."

"Good one," Lana said, rolling her eyes.

"Shut up.  Anyway, we're probably going to need a couple million dollars.  Or so."

There was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone.  Finally, Mallorie said, "Sterling, if this is another one of your voicemail pranks..."

"For God sake, Mother.  It isn't.  Jesus, you leave eighteen different elaborate voicemail pranks and it's like people don't trust you anymore."

"Is that Archer?" Cheryl's voice came through the phone.

"Hang up the phone!" Mallorie said.

"Is he asking for a couple million dollars after he did two hundred thousand dollars worth of damage to my mansion?"

"One," Archer said, "that was mostly Babu.  Two, how many times do I have to apologize for that."

"Once would be nice!" Cheryl said.

"Where are you?" Mallorie asked.

"Outside your office," Cheryl said.

"Not you!  Where are Archer and Lana?"

"With ISIS," Archer said.

"No, we're the ones at ISIS headquarters," Cheryl said.

"For God sake, get off the line!" Mallorie shouted.  Cheryl sighed and hung up.

"Mallorie," Lana said.  "We were on the Malian-Nigerian border when we got captured.  Because your dumbass son doesn't exercise caution when he's in a part of the world where Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise."

"Niger, please." Sterling said.

"What?!" Lana demanded.

"No, I said, Niger as in the country.  And please as in, 'oh please, there's no way this place is full of Islamic fundamentalists.'"

The terrorist stepped forward, jabbing Archer with his weapon again.

"Look!" Archer yelled.  "I've gone too damn long without a drink.  So if you don't relax, I'm about to make a sequel to Terms of Enrampagement!  That's right!  Terms of Enrampagement 2!  Electric Rampagealoo!  That's all going to you!"

"To who?  Me or him?" Lana asked, pointing at the terrorist.

"For the last goddamn time, Lana!  It's whom!" 

As he shouted "whom," Archer stole the AK 47 from the terrorist and mowed down the captors.  With the terrorists dead on the ground, Archer took a few deep breaths as smoke creeped out of his gun barrel. 

"Whom is still alive?" Cheryl asked through the phone.

#### [WP] You are Placebo Man. Your superpowers are whatever the people nearby you believe you have.

Score: 1888

I throw the ornate knife with pinpoint accuracy.  This is the most crucial part of my attack, and I can't use my superpowers for it, so I've practiced it extensively.  It spins once and sinks into the wall inches away from the henchman, the symbol carved into its hilt clearly visible.

"Shit.  It's a cape!" The gangsters spin around, looking for the source of the throw, but I've already vanished into the shadows.

"Which one?"

"I know that symbol!  It's Nighthawk!  That fucking ninja guy!  Get flashlights, group up, don't let him pick you off!  You four, get to the exits, don't let him out of here!"

It feels like a sixth sense has been added into my brain.  I'm not seeing the warehouse as a maze of pillars and crates and catwalks. I'm seeing cover, concealment, lines of sight and takedown spots.  I leap up with impossible grace and vanish into the shadows above them.  Two gunmen have just enough time to scream out a warning before I drop down on top of them, knocking them both out in a quick martial arts maneuver.  By the time their friends arrive, I've vanished again.

"Where'd he go?  We had him surrounded!  He just disappeared!"

"No shit, Sherlock.  Nighthawk can teleport through shadows."

"What?  I thought that was Shadowman."

"No, Shadowman was the guy who could turn shadows solid."

"You sure about that?"

"Well if he can't teleport, where the fuck did he go?"

The belief clicks into place in their minds and another power clicks into place in mine.  All around me, I see black ribbons, pathways I can walk through to reach another pool of shadows.  I teleport behind the two guards at the exit, and vanish deeper into Dr. Noc's lair.

The warehouse was an easy place to be Nighthawk, plenty of shadows and hiding places, but now that I'm in the lair itself it'll be a bit harder.  The Doctor's labs are more brightly lit and more enclosed.  I need a new guise.

A patrolling guard gives me the opportunity.  The belief from the henchmen a floor above gives me enough strength and skill to yank him around a corner and knock him unconscious.  I grab his radio and speak.  "Everyone, Nighthawk and Paragon are in the building!  We need backup!  We need-" I cut the transmission.  That should draw some attention.

I take off my cloak, revealing a bright gold and blue uniform.  I shed the winglike cowl and replace it with a classic domino mask.  Immediately, I can feel strength fill my limbs.  Paragon is an unstoppable, invincible bruiser, and I crash through the Doctor's elite guards with ease.

As I fight, I'm pleasantly surprised to find that I can fly.  Paragon is so similar to all the classic "flying brick" superheroes that they're starting to get me mixed up with them.  I reach Dr. Noc's inner sanctum and kick down the door.

Something hits me in the gut.  Pain lances through me like a red-hot poker and I fall on my back, clutching my chest.  Dimly I realize, *I've been shot.*  The Paragon uniform has Kevlar underneath, just in case I get shot while setting up my persona, but either it didn't stop the bullet or the impact was just that strong.  My vision clears, and I see the Doctor and two henchmen with assault rifles standing over me.

"See?  I told you, he's weak against depleted phlebotinum bullets.  You'll have no trouble disposing of him now."

I stare up at the grinning Doctor as he steps towards me.  "You knew?" I gasp.

"Oh yes.  All I had to do was tell my henchmen that you had a secret weakness, and your own powers did the work.  They believe their bullets will hurt you, and they do."

"How...?"

"How did I know?  A few clues.  None of the members of Justice Fist were ever seen in the same place, for one.  That charade of 'taking a divide and conquer strategy' didn't hold up for long.  Talking to Mr. Hammer's former henchmen revealed that Nighthawk never made his entrance until someone saw his symbol.  Tricks like that."

He's got me dead to rights.  The Paragon guise is ruined, and I can't change my costume in plain view.  Or can I?  Inspiration strikes.

"Clever," I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. "But not clever enough.  Did you really think that this was a one-man show?  You think I was stupid enough to build a whole super-team on a lie?"

I see a flicker of concern cross his face. "Think about it. Nighthawk and Arbiter carry all those gadgets, but you never asked who built them.  You never realized I had an actual super-scientist on the team."

I roll to one side, revealing that I've pulled a small black box with a red button from my utility belt.  "You never realized that some of these powers were for real."

I glance up at the henchmen, still holding me at gunpoint. "I've got two words for you goons:  Forcefield generator."

"It's a bluff!  Shoot him!  Shoot him!"

Too late.  I can feel the belief snap down in their minds, and a light on the box turns green as their belief gives it power.  I push the button and a flickering blue dome springs into being around me.  Their bullets patter off it like rain.

Seizing the advantage, I grab a syringe from my belt, full of a mysterious blue liquid.  Like the Red Button, it's a bluff, only given power because they believe in it.  I slam it into my arm, and a dozen half-remembered movies about secret supersoldier projects flicker through their brains.  Their belief becomes a burst of healing and strength that cures the bullet wound.  I execute a kipup and land in a fighting stance, glaring at the henchmen.

"Still think I'm just a fake?"

EDIT: Obligatory "Holy cow I got gold?" edit.  Thank you, you're too kind.

FADE IN:

INT. A DARK ROOM

*A young man sits on a large blob of slowly undulating plastic. This is DAVE. Each time that he shifts his weight, the whitish mass beneath him adjusts itself slightly, forcing him to move in a constant search for comfort.*

**T'AAR:** (*O.S.*) I'm so sorry about the wait, ma'am!

*A diminutive alien walks into view. This is T'AAR, a bureaucrat, who is carrying what appears to be a rectangle of softly glowing light.*

**DAVE:** It's "sir," actually.    
**T'AAR:** Oh, I'd much prefer to stick to the formalities, ma'am.    
**DAVE:** "Sir" is a formality.

*T'aar glances at the glowing rectangle.*

**T'AAR:** Really? What does it mean?    
**DAVE:** Uh, well... it's the masculine form of "ma'am."    
**T'ARR:** You distinguish by gender in your honorifics?    
**DAVE:** I guess?    
**T'AAR:** Interesting. Well, ma'am... uh, sir... I understand that you've registered a formal complaint with the Galactic Transportation Authority.

*Dave suddenly looks desperate.*

**DAVE:** No! No, it's like I keep telling everyone: This is all a big misunderstanding!    
**T'AAR:** I'm sure it is, ma... sir. We'll see about getting it sorted right out. What was the nature of your complaint?    
**DAVE:** I didn't make a complaint!

*Once again, T'aar glances at the glowing rectangle.*

**T'AAR:** References to intercourse are considered expletives in your culture, yes?    
**DAVE:** In some situations, yes, but...    
**T'AAR:** (*Interrupting*) Oh, wait! This is back to that whole "gendered honorifics" thing, isn't it?    
**DAVE:** ... What?    
**T'AAR:** Sorry, just an observation. To the point, though: You *did* shout "Screw GTA!" over an all-systems broadcast, did you not?

*Dave's desperation gives way to nervousness.*

**T'AAR:** (*CONT'D*) Once translated from your tongue, "GTA" becomes an initialism for...    
**DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) I didn't know *aliens* would hear it! I was just mad about a video game!    
**T'AAR:** "Video game?"    
**DAVE:** It's... it's entertainment. We use computers to simulate the world, and then we... you know, we play games.    
**T'AAR:** Oh, yes, we do similar things when we're designing ships.    
**DAVE:** Well, there's a little more to it than that. Like, in GTA, you drive around stealing things and shooting people.

*T'aar's enormous black eyes widen further.*

**T'AAR:** Sorry... you *shoot* people? With weapons?    
**DAVE:** It's not real!    
**T'AAR:** I should hope not. This is entertainment to you?    
**DAVE:** Yeah. It seems kind of weird, right? What with all the war going on.    
**T'AAR:** What war? Your species isn't space-faring.    
**DAVE:** Oh. Well, it's... we fight each other.

*A moment of silence passes.*

**T'AAR:** Is this a joke?    
**DAVE:** What? No!    
**T'AAR:** You honestly fight amongst yourselves? Why?    
**DAVE:** There are lots of reasons. Resources, religion...    
**T'AAR:** (*Interrupting*) What's that?    
**DAVE:** A can of worms that I'm not going to get into right now.    
**T'AAR:** ... Your species fights over worms.    
**DAVE:** No! We mostly fight over land!    
**T'AAR:** What land?    
**DAVE:** *Any* land!    
**T'AAR:** Ma'am, you're not making any sense.    
**DAVE:** "Sir."    
**T'AAR:** Yes?    
**DAVE:** ... No, no, *I'm* a "sir."    
**T'AAR:** Oh, yes, you mentioned as much. Now, please elaborate.    
**DAVE:** Look, we have these different countries, okay? Some of them don't like each other.    
**T'AAR:** So they go to war.    
**DAVE:** Yes.    
**T'AAR:** In video games.    
**DAVE:** No, for real.    
**T'AAR:** You *physically kill each other* because people on one piece of land don't like people on another piece of land?    
**DAVE:** Ye... yes?    
**T'AAR:** And this has something to do with worms?    
**DAVE:** N... well... look, it's complicated.

*T'aar's voice adopts a patronizing tone.*

**T'AAR:** Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it's very complicated. Just wait here for a couple more minutes, okay? I'll be back shortly.    
**DAVE:** No, wait, what about...

*Before Dave can finish his sentence, T'aar disappears into the darkness.*

**T'AAR:** (*O.S.*) Make yourself comfortable!

*Dave shifts around on the blob of undulating plastic. Eventually, he gets up and sits on the floor.*

**DAVE:** (*To himself*) Well, it beats visiting the DMV...

FADE OUT.

"No, John, no!" Marie cried. "The doctor said it'll kill him! Look at how red he's turning!"

"Gerddarnnit, Marie!" John snapped. "My father ate peanuts, and his father before him, and it was good enough for them! Our boy's going to eat peanuts!"

"Please, John, please!" 

"I'll have no more of this backtalk! Now, it's time for his bath!"

"No, John!" Marie rushed after her husband as he carried the baby up the stairs. "Please, you can't!"

"Gerdarnnit, Marie! The boy's gotta get clean! Do you know a way to get a boy clean that *don't* involve scrubbin' him in a bathtub full of Skippy Smooth 'N Creamy?"

Marie hung her head low and stepped back. "No," she admitted. "I don't suppose I do."

"It was good enough for my father, and it'll be good enough for him!" John said, rubbing Skippy Peanut Butter into his son's hair. 

"Oh, John, look!" Marie rose a trembling hand to her mouth. "The boy! He's gone into shock!"

For a moment John didn't know what to do. He watch helplessly as his boy writhed and convulsed in the tub, paralyzed by the nagging thought, *could I -- in some indirect way -- be partly responsible for this?* 

Then the shock shedded away, replaced by the firm resolve that paternal instinct sparked in his gut. There was no time for placing blame. He had to take action. 

"Marie," John said. "Get the first-aid peanuts."

#### [WP] The zombie apocalypse breaks out. You remain safe in isolation for 30+ years. Someone finds you and informs you the zombie apocalypse ended 20 years ago.

Score: 1874

I went about my usual routine, deep below the ground in my cold war era bunker.  
Technically it wasn't mine; it had belonged to some billionaire and I'd read about it in a Time magazine years ago. In the chaos of the Outbreak, I made my way there and had planned to beg entry, offering my services as an electrician and all-round handyman.  
Well, that hadn't been needed in the end; their bodies sat in the back of the subterranean wine cellar, mummifying in the still air down there.  
The TV hadn't picked up a signal in 30 years but I still liked to sit in front of it; powered still by the miniature hydroelectric plant in the catacombs beyond the cellar. The flickering static and the gentle hissing noises through the old speakers were compelling and comforting.  
My steps echoed down the empty, opulent corridors of the richly appointed apocalypse shelter. Dust lay thick everywhere that I didn't walk. Who had time for cleaning? Besides, there were dozens of rooms, along with the driving range and the swimming pool - both fallen into decay. Only frogs and algae lived in the stagnant waters now.  
The library was one of my other haunts. Weak electric light flickered behind the stained glass windows, giving the impression of a dying sunset - or the flames of the apocalypse. I had never decided which.  
Like the TV though, the light offered comfort and I often found myself drawn here.  
Pictures of the rich family still littered the bunker. John and Sarah, oil barons from Texas or somesuch. I couldn't really remember. I paused in front of a dusty mirror, startled by my own reflection - just as I had been thousands of times before - then realised my mistake and wandered on.  
I had no idea how long it had been now; time really had lost all meaning to me in my palatial exile. It could have been ten years, it could have been two. It could have been forty.  
Only one room was really 'my' room. At first I'd moved between them, but this one seemed like it was *mine*. I guess it reminded me of my childhood bedroom; the zoetrope constantly casting fanciful shadows around the spaceship wallpaper and the bunkbeds speaking of simpler times.  
One of the resident rats scuttled out and attempted to nip me but I carelessly put my foot down; breaking its spine and leaving it paralysed.  
A sound echoed down the corridor and caught my attention.  
*What was that?*  
Turning, I ignored the twitching rodent and made for the stairs to the upper levels.  
There is was again. A definite sound - a *new* sound.  
Hurrying now, I stumbled up the stairs in my haste, reaching the landing as I heard more alien sounds.  
*Voices?*  
Yes, voices!  
How long had it been since I'd heard voices? I didn't know.  
My own vocal cords worked to respond but it had been too long since they had been used.  
*"Footprints!* There's someone down here!" yelled an excited voice.  
Another responded,  
"Shit, *thirty years* someone's been down here?" came a reply - a woman's voice.  
"Yeah, some poor bastard has been here twenty years longer than they needed."  
I hurried towards the laughter and the light of their electric torches.   
Then they were in front of me, shocked by my sudden appearance.  
*"Holy shi-"* started the woman, but was cut off as I gouged open her throat with my exposed jaws.  
The man went next; his face raked open with my skeletal fingertips, blinded. The last tried to run but I lashed out and snagged his hip, tearing open cloth and flesh, slowing him down considerably.  
As he hobbled frantically away from me, yelling in terror, my new family member rose behind me, her half-severed head lolling to one side.  
I grinned in bloody, mummified joy.  
My isolation was over.

The comet blazed through the sky, like a piece of the sun come to bless us with life.  But it did not come to bless us at all.  Soon the clouds turned grey with smoke, and the next great extinction of earth was at hand.  The greatest scientists in the history of our race worked as hard as they could, and they soon developed weapons that combated nature itself as the planet tried its hardest to kill us.  Eventually though, even the strongest methods failed.  The last remaining authority loaded a small spaceship with the people necessary to build a colony, along with several hundred fertilized eggs, so that our race would survive.  After years of traveling at close to the speed of light, we finally reached our new home.

We sent down the first of the colony ships, and it blazed through the sky, like a piece of the sun come to bless the planet with life.  We seeded the clouds with the materials we needed for survival, turning them away from their natural color.  The natives fought back, but they made no attempt to communicate, and we assumed that there was no hope for peace between our races.  We survived, just barely, as the planet tried its hardest to kill us.  Eventually though, we prevailed, and as the last of the natives fled the planet, we knew that our race would survive, and settled into our new home.

#### [WP] The Earth is flat, you, as the head of NASA, have to explain to the incoming President why its a secret.

Score: 1866

"Wait wait wait. Wait." The president rubbed his fingers along his brow, breaking out into a cold sweat. "You're telling me it's an actual flat, fall off the side of the map and  into the abyss type deal?" 

"Oh no, It's quite hard to fall off the side of the Earth, Mr.President." Charlie Bolden smiled, giving a shrug. "That would be indicative of a one sided planet, which is quite rare. No, our Earth has two sides. That's why we get to experience night." 

It was traditional for the head of NASA to explain the workings of the cosmos to the incoming president. As Charlie Bolden had been appointed during Obama's administration, it was his first time preforming the secret duty. To his credit, though, he was explaining the situation admirably. 

Incoming President O'Malley leaned back against his chair, looking over the oval office. He could almost hear the world laughing at him. He thought he lucked out when Sanders vanished and Hill-dog lost it and literally tore Trump's throat out. At that point, he had won the presidency by default. The difficulties of the job started piling into his lap. 

"So, where does the world, uh, split? The equator, right?" 

Boden was impressed. He nodded. "Yes, actually. Right along the hemispheres. This is why the northern hemisphere experiences winter while the southern experiences summer."

O'Malley nodded, and swallowed loudly. "And why do we keep it a secret?" 

The acting administrator smiled wide; his feet carrying him to the globe in the center of the Oval Office. He spun it idly. "Well, sir, why don't you come over here and I'll explain it."

The president of the united states nodded solemnly and made his way to the globe. His eyes lit up as Bolden pressed his fingers against two very specific locations in the North American continent. His thumb pressed against Dallas, and his index found it's way to a small crevice representing the grand canyon. There was a subtle click, and smoke began pouring out of the equator. 

"Mother of God." O'Malley whispered, watching the scene unfold.

The President of the United States saw something move in Charlie's eyes. Something was behind him.

"Surprise, Cockbag!" 

He turned, and George W. Bush punched him in the face. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama burst from behind the curtains and highfived. 

"Suck it, freshman!" They yelled, in unison.

O'Malley fell backwards into the globe and groaned, his head spinning. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Jimmy Carter waddling forward. He was wielding a black sharpie in one shaky, humanitarian hand. He could feel the slick ink spell out the words "Shitlord" on his forehead. 

George Bush Senior walked out from a false floor, the one the secret service had been told to use only in emergencies, with a bottle of tequila. 

Everyone (except for the current Potus) began yelling "USA, USA, USA!" and highfiving the Administrator of NASA.

Clinton took a selfie. #NoWife.

"Good for them," Zolforat commented as they observed humans farming the cradle of civilization. "Tools and agriculture? Why, they're looking positively sentient."

"Real moxy," Mefro, Zolforat's companion, agreed. "I can hardly understand how they manage to stand up like that!" It stamped its twelve hooves in emphasis. "And in *that* gravity? They're lucky to be more than a foot tall!"

Zolforat put the ship back into gear. "Real shame about them. If they ever had a chance to develop beyond simple tools, they might be quite interesting to meet." They zipped off toward their final destination and forgot about the rapidly-spinning blue planet in almost no time.

----------

"I say, *those* are the humans?" Zolforat gasped on the way toward refueling in the atmosphere of one of Jupiter's moons. Down on the surface, they observed a city of over a million right in the center of an oddly shaped peninsula. Boats of wood sailed the seas, and stone roads criss-crossed the continent. "Well I'll be damned! They developed this much in just a few thousand orbits?? Why, look at all that!"

"Stone buildings!" Mefro whispered, awestruck. "In *that* gravity? Can you imagine?"

Zolforat was astounded. "I know! But cheers to them for making it this far! Glad we got to see them at their peak!"

----------

"What in the... Mefro, you've got to see what they've done now!" The two had made quite the hobby of watching the poor backwards humans. It was inspiring, watching them try their hardest. But also depressing, knowing that they were trapped on that little rock for the rest of time. "They're using *steam* for power!"

Mefro seemed impressed. "Clever little devils! I kind of almost want to see them try to make it to orbit."

"Oh, don't say that," Zolforat chided his companion. "There isn't enough water on the planet to produce enough steam to make it into orbit. They wouldn't even hit the second atmosphere layer before plummeting back down. Poor little guys."

"I know," Mefro said. "You're right; I shouldn't have said that. I'm just proud of them for making it this far." The two had developed almost *paternal* feelings for the poor little human buggers. 

"Farewell, humans!" Zolforat told them as the two went off on their way again. "What do you think, Mefro: will they have discovered electricity by the time we return?"

-------

Their ship hovered over the burnt remains of a city on an island in the little blue planet's largest ocean. Scanners confirmed what the two already feared: radioactive fallout. This had been a *nuclear* detonation. Surveillance video from the drone they'd left in orbit showed another chilling discovery: long-range rockets traveling a distance of over 200 miles, packed with explosives. It should have been impossible with that level of gravity, but the damned humans had done it. With just a little more power, one of those could break orbit! On the surface, *millions* upon *millions* of humans teemed on every continent, in unimaginable numbers. And it was getting more and more crowded by the second. 

"Uh...." Zolforat finally managed to take four of his eyes off of the screen to look back at Mefro. "We... uh... we should probably tell someone about this."

#### [WP] Among Alien species humans are famous for prefering pacifism but being the most dangerous species when they are forced to fight.

Score: 1853

From the personal journal of Astro-chronicler Des Variin.

Humans.  Reviled, worshiped, misunderstood, underestimated.  I first encountered these curious beings some 100 standard years ago, and have yet to fully understand all that makes them so damndibly different from all the other galactic races.

They follow the celestial standard, being bipedal with large brains and being more or less symmetrical, and possessing an organized community.  Humans are curious, nearly to a fault, much like the All'tarr.  They desire to understand the hows and whys of nearly everything they encounter that is different from their normal.  Sometimes this backfires, but usually makes for exceptional leaps in technological advancement far in excess of their time past First Star Exploration (an anthropoligically understood time standard).  They are as advanced technologically, at FSE 125, as other species are at FSE's upwards of 400.  

Humans have, comparatively, short lives but fast reproductive cycles.  This has several effects on their psyche, I theorize.  Their relative fast reproductive rate makes the loss of individuals easier to deal with, so their curious nature that at times gets them into trouble is buffered.

They are, however, aware of their mortality, and so tend to be some of the more pacifistic beings in the galaxy.  Fearing the loss of Human lives, and by extension the lives of others.  They live passionately, love completely, and trust unconditionally.  Usually.  Their short lives means that often times, they live in the moment, but this more often than not means they respect life more than other long lived races that sometimes take their incredibly long lives for granted.  They have been known to broker deals between warring parties and fostering fledgling races when they are found, instead of pacifying them with violence.

Yet, to consider the humans to be pure pacifists, as the Aldarri, would be a heinous mistake.  Their relatively difficult evolution has carefully honed even the most average Human into an organism capable of enduring and inflicting great violence.

For the average Galactic Citizen, when struck in the abdomen with a blaster bolt unprotected, the shock to the neuro system is so severe that death is three to six seconds away.  Humans have been known to survive for as long as eighty minutes, fighting with lethal ability for the first fourteen.  

They are rational and compassionate, but in a stressful situation, a strange evolutionary mechanism manifests, called the fight or flight condition.  Humans possess a gland, that in times of extreme stress, excretes a combat drug.  This drug dulls pain, slows blood loss, and allows for extreme physical performance.  Last year, a settler on Innova-G lifted a 1000 Kg shipping container that had fallen onto her child at their farmstead and rescued the child.

They also have been noted to have an impressive ability to continue to fight after taking damage.  Fighters in their combat sports often continue to mount effective defenses even after taking devastating strikes to their brain cases.  Other fighters have been observed allowing an opponent to dislocate joints rather than forfeit the fight, often continuing to fight until the official stops the match.  There are countless images in the medical files of humans impaled with objects that would have killed 87% of Galactic Council Species.

In Standard Calendar 8327, the Vall discovered the extreme of the Human's fighting capacity when they launched an offensive against 60% of the Human held worlds.  The Humans were only known to the Galactic Councel for 12 Standard years, and thought by all to be pacifists, because of the several successful treaties they brokered in their earliest years.  The Vall wanted the heavy metals known to exist in the Human home solar system's asteroid belt and launched a campaign despite several rounds of negotiations.  Ultimately, this was felt by the humans as a direct attack against the Human Home world, and Humans as a whole.

Today, there is no Vall Home world, and only 20% of the Vall continue to exist.  The Humans have a saying where they "Make an Example" of someone.  The Vall is that someone.  The Vall are currently the Human's most fervent allies.  they learned the hard way about the human's darker side.

The Humans are known as the best friend you could have, and the worst enemy.  The Vall have seen both.  I have been blessed to only have been their friend.

#### [WP] A creationist discovers time-travel and goes to 4000 BC to watch the beginning of the Universe. To their shock, they find themselves stranded in the early Bronze Age.

Score: 1850

I am astonished. More than astonished, I'm dumbfounded.

I always believed in my Bible, and that the world is a bare 6000 years old. The good book is clear about how the universe, and all of creation, was...er...well...created. It was by Jesus. And by Jesus I mean God, who is both the father and the whole. 

Fossils are a conspiracy. A false idol planted by the Devil to trick us. Carbon dating is just bad science, and no match for the divine power of miracles and the holy spirit. These are self-evident truths.

And yet, here I am. Despite having the Lord's guidance to demonstrate that the rules of "science" are nothing more than his gentle hand guiding us, despite stretching the boundaries of Einstein's "theories", I do not stand at the start of the universe. I do not stand on the sixth day, watching Adam and Eve in the garden. I don't even stand *in a garden*. It's more like a... sort of scrubby desert.

A scrubby desert populated by tribes with sticks and basic tools.

And so I am astonished. Dumbfounded. 

The Lord has chosen to punish me for my vanity. Obviously this "time travel device" is nothing of the sort. It's just some kind of teleporter that's taken me to... I don't know. Some backward country that isn't Americanized yet.

Lord, you have denied me the sight of the beginning of the universe. And I, your servant, have been chastened. If you see it in your grace to return me to 'Merica, I promise I'll destroy this false device and never think myself worthy of touching your face again.

Bless you, Lord. And bless the United States of America.


Edit: I should add a comment for fairness here. A lot of people have criticised this post for aiming at low hanging fruit or consisting of cliched, pandering-to-the-crowds stuff.


They are right. It's *entirely* a cheap shot. It's a cheap shot at religion, at the Christian right of American politics, and of people who stick to erroneous beliefs in the face of absolute proof. It was never meant to be much more. It took me 5-10 minutes to write on a boring afternoon, and it brought a smirk to my face. It's a cheap, lazy characature with very little style or substance that ticks a load of preconceived boxes.


I don't apologise for that. That would be the same as apologising for sometimes watching bad TV, or popping to MacDonalds instead of cooking a proper meal.

If you don't like it, that's fine. You are entitled to your opinion, but don't mistake this for my effort at the next War and Peace. I write because I enjoy it, and I hope others enjoy it. That's my sole motivation.

It's just *satire*. And I thank everyone who got that; I'm glad you enjoyed it.

#### [WP] Superman is mentally handicapped. That's why he thinks nobody can pick up the Clark Kent=Superman thing, and everyone plays along in an effort to keep him from throwing a tantrum. The comics are his idea of what is going on. What does a day in Metropolis actually look like?

Score: 1849

The man in the phone booth was nearly naked, except for a pair of tighty whities. Through the glass, Dave could clearly see the faded stains on his underwear as the poor guy struggled to put on a tight blue shirt. Unfortunately, phone booths are pretty damn cramped, and it was slow going. He'd been in there for nearly 20 minutes now banging his elbows on the walls, and hadn't even started on his pants yet. 

"Really sorry about this," the woman standing near the door told Dave. She had a very pretty, but regretful, smile. "I'm afraid this booth is going to be in use for a while. Maybe you want to use the one down the block?"

Dave rolled his eyes. "I'm expecting a call on this one. Why is he getting dressed in *a phone booth*?"

"It's... a long story," she said. "I'm his nurse, Lois. Clark here has some pretty severe mental difficulties. In his mind, this is really just taking a split second. And it's so urgent that he doesn't have time to go anywhere else to go change." She gave a short bark of laughter, a mix of sadness and mirth. "Well, even though he has super speed and could get to his apartment in the blink of an eye."

Dave peered through the glass; the man's head was stuck inside the tight blue fabric. "What's he changing into, anyway? Why not just leave his suit on?" The jacket, pants, and white shirt were all crumpled on the dirty floor of the booth. 

"It's his secret identity," she said. She held up a copy of today's paper. But instead of the headline about Kennedy's blockade of Cuba, it instead showed a doctored photo of that same man 'flying' over a sandy tropical beach with what looked like an ICBM in hand. The headline read: **Superman kicks Khrushchev and his missiles out of Cuba!** "He thinks he's a superhero," Lois explained. "Thinks he can fly, has super strength... all sorts of powers, really. I have a hard time keeping track of them all, to be honest."

Dave studied the fake newspaper. It was *really* well done. "Where'd you get this?" he asked her.

"Oh, Mr. Kent has a special edition of the Planet printed every day. Being the owner of the paper gets you some pretty nice perks. Ever since he moved from Kansas to be CEO, he's employed me and Clark here as 'reporters' and lets us go chase 'stories' all day about crime lords. Even hires actors and such to 'fight' his son." She smiled. "Mr. Kent's really a sweet guy. It's touching to see how he takes care of his son like this."

Dave didn't seem to think so. "Well, that's nice for him. But it's also kind of preventing me from using the booth." As if on cue, the phone inside began to ring. The man inside had managed to get the shirt on, and Dave could see a big yellow and red "S" on the back. "Why is the 'S' on the front in the photo?" he asked the nurse, pointing to the phony paper. 

She glanced over her shoulder. "Oh, damn. Backwards again. I'll have to fix it later."

The phone kept ringing. "Forget it," Dave finally said. The man in the booth hadn't even started on his pants yet. "I'll just go back to my office and try to track down my friend's number." He cast one last glance into the booth, where the man was spinning in circles now. "Good luck with your... superhero friend," he said, voice dripping in sarcasm.

-----

**45 minutes later**

------

"Don't worry, Ms. Lane!" 'Superman' said as he emerged from the phone booth. The front of his shirt was a blank blue, and the 'S" was covered up by his cape. "*I'll* stop Lex Luthor!"

Lois gave an exaggerated gasp and pressed her palms to her cheeks. "My gosh, Superman! Where did *you* come from??"

#### [WP] To our surprise, humanity is the most coldly rational species in the galaxy.

Score: 1846

Remember when we first met?

You said, to your crew members "Oh, look, a human. He's cute", and waved at me. And I said "HOLY MOTHER OF 
GOD AN ALIEN", and tried to kill you with a shovel.

Then things cooled off, and the people from our planets got to know each other, and they learned to live in a 
somewhat state of peace.

And me and you, we learned a whole new thing we could live with. A whole new state. Of love.

Like a fairy tale, Kara, you came from the sky and pulled me out of my crappy studio apartment and you showed me 
life. For that, I'll always be grateful.

Remember? Remember when I told you that your home, to us, was in the middle of a little thing we called 
Sagittarius, and that it sort of looked like an archer, ready to shoot its arrows into the sky.

Then I told you about the story of Cupid and Psyche, and how funny it was that I had found love in the tip of an 
arrow.

Then I tried to teach you all about metaphors. But you knew about that already, emotional as all you people are.

"You never want to die for love", you used to say. Remember?

When we were looking at the stars up that hill in Amarillo, and you said "let's jump down and embrace", and I said 
"we will die", and you said "so what? It will be romantic."

And I said "It would be irrational."

"You and that fancy word", you said, and tried to pull me to the edge.

Sorry I was so afraid to die for love.

Sorry I was so afraid to die for you.

Remember when it was cold in Prague, and I said we better find a hotel to spend the night, and you said "why can't 
we just hold each other and sleep here, on the sidewalk?"

And I said "We would die. It wouldn't be --"

"-- rational. Yeah, yeah", you replied, making that cute little angry face I learned to love and miss.

I'm sorry about so many things, Kara.

I'm so sorry you had to go back to your planet. Sorry my people decided that. It was, as I'm sure you know, the 
most *rational* decision, for us humans. That you and your peers return, and we stay.

Sorry the wormhole closed, and now you can't come back.

I know you'll try, anyway.

Remember when we stayed the whole day in bed, back in Marseille?

You said, "Let's never get out of bed. Let's make love and sleep and make love and sleep forever. Shut the door, 
throw the keys away, let's lock our love inside this room."

And I said "We would --"

"-- die. It wouldn't be rational. Blah, blah, blah."

Sorry I didn't want to die for you, Kara.

But you can't come back. I know you'll try. But you can't.

The trip, without the wormhole, it takes 60 years.

We'll be almost ninety, by the time you come. Not counting you might get caught, and sent back before I even get 
the chance to kiss you.

Kara. I miss kissing you.

You can't spend your whole life on a spaceship, alone, waiting for the chance to maybe see me again, an old man 
when you get here... for what? Five years? Ten, if we are lucky? If at all?

I can't let you do that, Kara. I can't let you throw a lifetime away for some washed up years by my side.

It wouldn't be rational.

Please, please, don't blame yourself. And please, when you remember me, don't remember this tear-stained, 
cheesy, downer of a video recording.

Remember when I gave you a rose in Central Park and you screamed and you stepped on it. And then, after you 
calmed down, you had to explain to me that flowers are a deadly creature in your planet, kind of like lions here on 
Earth. Remember that.

Remember when I kissed you, and then, foolishly asked, "Do you guys do that in your planet?"

And you answered that yes, you did. And you did more stuff, too.

Remember smiles and conversations and laughter. Remember looks and moments. Not this.

Not this video. Not this red-eyed, sad little recording, talking to you from your ship's control room screen.

Step away now and go live your life. A normal life. Not a lonely one inside a metal cube, gliding through darkness 
for six decades in the hopes of seeing me.

Don't come.

Because I'm dead, Kara. I'm dead, if you're watching this.

So there's no point in coming over to see me, anymore. It wouldn't be rational.

Go back. Step away. Get out of this ship and go live your life. 

Go be happy.

Remember me, next time a flower tries to kill you. All I ask.

All the love in the galaxy,

Hank.

#### [WP] You applied for a job at google, everything goes well and only one interview remains: They'd just like an explanation for your search history.

Score: 1843

"Well, Mr. Powell," the interviewer adjusted his glasses, "Your references all seem to be in order, and everyone spoke very highly of you."

The last knot in my stomach unraveled. *Thank god*. I mean, I knew that I would have nothing to worry about. Otherwise, why would I have listed those people as references? But still: it was nice to finally hear. I'd been through days of testing and seen the applicant pool whittled down from two hundred to just three of us left, applying for two spots. 

"Just one last thing." He removed a large (like, book-sized) manila folder from his desk and slammed it down in front of me, making the whole desk shake. "Let's discuss your search history." The sentence that *every* young man fears, though I'd been expecting it to come from my girlfriend, not a potential employer. 

"I..." He slid the folder over to me and then tapped his fingers together like Mr. Burns. I extended one finger and flipped the top of the folder open, like there was something disgusting inside that I didn't want to touch. 

First page was categorized as "Dangerous." It was a pretty broad term that included things like that time that I'd worked the graveyard shift and decided to learn all I could about the Kennedy Assassination. Then there was the times that I'd googled how to build bombs, propaganda techniques... you know, things that would make me seem like some sort of supervillain or terrorist. "Well this is all..." I stuttered, looking back down at the page as though some explanation might jump out at me. "Look, there's...." I was just curious, I swear!

He cleared his throat and nodded down, asking me to flip to the next bookmark. I turned to the next section, titled "Porn." I don't need to even go into detail, but let's just say that there were some *unorthodox* searches that would probably send my mother into a coma if she ever read this page. Even reading the searches without seeing the results made me feel like I needed a shower. "I can't be the only one who has looked at..." I glanced back down at the page again. Ok, maybe I was.

"Now, is this really the sort of person we want working at Google?" the interviewer asked.

I bowed my head, and I was just empty inside. I'd gotten so far through the process. It was in my grasp... and now it was slipping away. "Look, it's probably too late to change your mind. But isn't this *why* we have the internet? So that we can explore curiosity without judgment and get real answers instead of asking someone who doesn't really know either? Should we *really* be condemning that?"

He snorted. "Oh, *that's* what you thought the issue was?" He leaned over his desk and tapped the right corner of every page, showing the *Bing* logo. "We don't care what you're searching for, we just have doubts about your *judgment.*"

I gave a sigh of relief and closed the folder as fast as possible. I didn't even want to see what other sections were in there. "I was only able to use Internet Explorer from my work computer, and Bing was the default that I couldn't change." I explained through a nervous smile. Hopefully he wouldn't make the connection that all of those searches had been *while I was at work*. 

"Ah!" He slid the folder off the side of his desk, stood up, and shook my hand. "Well in that case, welcome aboard!"

#### [WP] One day you notice you haven't seen any Hitler related writing prompts for a full hour at least.

Score: 1836

I'd cracked the /r/writingprompts code. I'd written thousands of sample Hitler stories, covering every conceivable scenario. I'd racked up over 100,000 comment karma over the last few months just copy-pasting my pre-written Hitler stories every few hours.

You may remember my 2,500-word supernatural action-thriller in response to *Hitler is born in America instead*. How could something so well-crafted be written in 30 minutes? Sorry to disappoint, but it took over a week of polishing.

Or how about my response to *You go back in time and kill Hitler, but something worse takes his place*? I did this one as a comedy. Because nothing's worse than Hitler.

*Hitler goes back in time and kills you* - This one was pretty weird but I managed to pull it off anyways, as you're probably aware.

So imagine my surprise when I opened up my browser this morning and there wasn't a *single* Hitler prompt sitting in "rising" or "new," let alone in "hot." I waited a few hours – still nothing.

I decided to take matters into my own hands. I fired up my alt (/u/NotRPWrites) and posted a killer Hitler prompt. *You are literally Hitler. You travel back in time to stop some time travelers who want to kill your parents.* I then posted my pre-written story fifteen minutes later and sat back.

A few minutes later, the first downvote appeared. Or rather, first two downvotes – one on the post itself, and one on my story. Then a comment: "What the fuck are you talking about?"

I clicked on my own username to see my history. I had negative three hundred and seventy-eight comment karma, which was quite a bit lower than I remembered. I looked back at some of my greatest Hitler stories, and almost all of them had massive downvotes and comment replies that were complete non-sequiturs.

I did a Reddit search for "Hitler" and found nothing except for my comments. *How is there nothing on Reddit about Hitler?*

That wasn't quite true. There was *one* /r/TodayILearned article about Hitler. I clicked through.

*TIL an Austrian painter named Adolf Hitler was killed by a futuristic plasma beam.*

Holy shit. Someone had done it. Someone had actually gone back in time and killed Hitler.

*...wait. Then how do I know about Hitler?*

#### [WP] You are a detective in 1890 Austria. The man inside the interrogation room claims to have an incredible secret that will exonerate him from his murder charge. You can't imagine what monster would murder a 1 year old child, let alone one as adorable as young Adolf Hitler was.

Score: 1824

His name was Werner Grenwald, and he had thirty-two perfectly aligned teeth.


I got to know this pleasant fact because the first time I met him, he was screaming. From the moment they brought him in until the moment I finally escorted him out, he did not stop screaming.


Instead we took lunch in my office on the third floor. He was still in cuffs, of course, but I had the impression that even if he were free, he would not run. 


His behavior was most curious.


You see, I was a detective. I had been trained to pick up on the littlest things, and there was quite a lot to pick up. For instance, Mr. Grenwald made a very conscious effort not to touch his feet to the floor. In the same vein, he would wince if I ever touched him with my right glove or if he brushed the left arm of his chair. There were a multitude of these little ‘micro-evasions’, as I’d come to call them: and in combination they turned this man into a writhing shape of fear and discomfort.



His first words were these:


“I did not believe that the Austrian police would resort to such savagery in this day and age.”



Those words remain with me still. But in that time I was brash and young, and I responded with all of the usual bravado.


“What could you possibly mean? I bring you up here for tea and a chat and you accuse me of savagery?”



He gestured with his head in his wincing, flitting way: “Not you, not now. Down there.”


“The questioning room?”


“The interrogation room,” he said. With such conviction. Such certainty. “The torture room.”


I didn’t let his knowledge faze me. “Ah, so you have an uncle in the police force. Yes, we have had to resort to some rather uncivilized tactics in recent days—but you cannot be civil with the criminal element. For example, with the type of element that kills children?”


“I did not kill a child,” he said.


“Ah, but you did.”


“A child is but a slice, you understand?”


I didn’t. We were talking about murder, not bratwurst. “No, I don’t take your meaning.”


“A child is just one slice. Time *t*, a part. Instantaneous. I didn’t kill a child,” he said. “I killed a person.”


I called for two coffees and relished at the sight of this delusional murderer trying and failing to drink with cuffed hands. I do regret that slice of me, now.


“So you admit you killed a person. Case closed, yes?”


“It was in self-defense.”


Interesting. “So little Adolf had a knife to your neck?”


“No, he had a shower-head.”


The clerk came around with a few sandwiches, and Werner winced as if the meat were a hot stove. “Do you have anything vegetarian?”


“Eat your meat or eat nothing.” 


The man fell silent, still squirming in his seat.


I resumed my line of questioning. “So tell me, what actual motive could you possibly—”


“I’d like you to touch me.”


I’d been warned of the homosexual epidemic in Braunau, but I never thought I’d come to face it myself. “I’m sorry?”


“I want you to touch me, please, on the cheek.”


I got up from my chair. Oh, I would touch him. I would touch him upon the jaw with four knuckles and all the weight of an ex-soldier. As I moved to strike he gasped, “No, please. Without the glove.”


And then I grew curious. 


I removed the leather glove and touched him on the cheek. He had no hair, there. He was barely a man, maybe fifteen years old. God. Children killing children on our streets, how horrid.


His eyes glazed over for a moment and he whispered, “You were born in the capital. Your father named you Reinhardt Hertz but your mother calls you Bärchen.” How did he know all this? What reason would anyone have to spy on—“You were a soldier but you hated killing. However, you enjoyed the violence. And so you became a constable here at this very station.” How? “Your children will be named Werner and Wilhelmina, and you will die in 1917 from the shock of seeing your son go to war.”


“What are you?”


“I see people, Detective.” His eyes flickered, like an addict’s. “I don’t see slices, I see people.”


“And you killed in self defense?”


“I killed in self defense. In the defense of others. I see people, and Adolf Hitler is a bad person. He kills all of us. Do you understand?”


“No. I don’t.”


His pupils were fully dilated, two deep dark holes. I wondered what they saw.


“This armchair is an antique, built in 1456. Three years ago, your colleagues beat an innocent man to death on this very floor. And many decades from now, after one Great War too many,” he said, “Adolf Hitler murders twelve million people.”


I had nothing to say. 


But the chief had plenty. He said an admitted child-murderer was a simple case, and a decent hanging would secure his post for another year or more. He would have none of this talk of 'people' and 'slices' and 'self-defense'. Preposterous, all of it.


I will never forget Werner Grenwald’s face as he felt the hemp brush against his cheek. I understood then what he was seeing, what he felt before he went. He died a thousand deaths before his final passing—perhaps more.



And I will never forget what he told me before he left. A whisper in my ear:


“Oh, the world seems unjust now, I know,” he said. “But, this is but a slice, time *t*, a part. I’ve *seen* the world whole, Detective. I've made it so. And it is nothing to fear.”

#### [WP] You wake up in Hell. You look around, you can't see anybody, it's just fire and brimstone going on forever. Eventually the Devil walks over and says "Finally, you're the first to arrive, so tell me, who are you? what did you do? and how did you die?"

Score: 1822

The van ploughed in to the side of my car. There was no pain, just a dull, tingling sensation all over my body as the blood leaked out and I faded in to unconsciousness.

I woke up. I found myself surrounded on all sides by an expanse of inhospitable, fissured rock of a dark red colour. What appeared to be magma could be seen flowing through the cracked geology, the occasional geyser spurting up with a brilliant intensity. The first thing I noticed, aside from my environment, was a figure approaching me from a distance. As he got closer, I saw an immaculate suit, and a face that looked almost human except for the deep, crimson eyes. He began to speak to me in a hoarse, strained voice, though I already knew what he was about to say.

"Welcome. I am the devil, and this is hell."

Though I had realised this already, there is no way to describe the dread that shoots up your spine when you these words are spoken to you. The second thing he said, however, took me by surprise.

"You are its sole occupant, well, except for me I suppose."

It took a few moments for this to sink in before my protest began.

"Really, I'm the only person to be sentenced to hell? What did I do? I never murdered, never raped, never stole. Are you telling me the people who did these things get to go to heaven, and I end up in hell?"

"Let me ask you," the devil began, "are you certain you died? What is the last you remember?"

"I was in a car accident, I lost consciousness, and I ended up here."

"Ah, exactly," responded the devil. "You lost consciousness. You have yet to die. My guess is that the paramedics will be reviving you in a few minutes. You see, the true reality of hell hasn't been expressed in any of the religious texts you humans are so fond of. Hell is an eternal punishment, and there is no crime you can commit on earth which could possibly warrant infinite retribution. Even for the worst of your species, the punishment would not fit the crime. Your presence here is only permitted due to the temporary nature of your death. Eternal punishment is only handed out for heavenly crimes, and I am the only one who has been found deserving. An eternal isolation in a barren, violent land. The only respite I get is when one such as yourself presents me with a brief moment of company. Time does not pass the same here as on earth, and the few minutes until your mortal revival will correspond to a few hours here. So please, do me the courtesy of a conversation. I'm so very lonely."

We sat down on the rocky ground and talked.

Dagon

By Doctor Murderstein

[Narrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37F_NnnkUlM&ab_channel=CyaelDobson) by the talented /u/cyaelsenpai


My father never introduced me to Dagon until shortly before he died. In retrospect, it wasn't that large of a shock to me. The position of ministry of finance had been vacant for ages, and though I never saw him actually doing the work it was a role my father, and his father before him, had claimed to fill. It was a suspicious state of affairs, with only a few trusted and tight-lipped staff being allowed in the lower levels near the treasury, and absolutely no one but the king allowed to proceed to the inner vault. 

The 'inner vault' was a small, mostly empty room towards the back of the treasury. It contained all the highest valuables of the Kingdom, mostly irreplaceable and intricate trinkets and gems that didn't actually take up that much room. The first time my father ever let me in the room with him it wasn't to show me any of this, though. In the back of this room filled with all the smallest and most ornate things in the kingdom was a small and beat up crate, the kind one might find in the kitchens. In that crate, was Dagon. It was when I laid eyes on him that father told me he was the most valuable thing to us in all the kingdom; that we and our people had prospered and been well fed and had a well-funded military for centuries because of Dagon's sole efforts.

He was pathetic. The wyrm's skin was gray and splotchy. His wings were shriveled, though functional with some effort, and one of his front legs had never healed right after an encounter with a rat trap, he would tell me later. He lay still, almost lifeless in his crate on a pile of gold and silver coins, some of which had obviously made up his bedding since the time of my great-great grandfather. Upon stirring I learned one of his eyes was milky white, but despite all appearances his voice was as strong as any man's and he spoke with the eloquence of an era gone by. He and my father spoke like old friends, and meeting me seemed to distress Dagon somewhat as he knew it meant my father's time was short.

He loved my father, fanatically so. At the end of the night when introductions had been made, and once I'd been briefed by my father and Dagon both, my father had sent me away to talk to Dagon alone. I'd turned as I left the vault, and watched as Dagon had flown to my father's shoulder, where he was well-received. From his spot on my father's shoulder the tiny dragon gripped my father's lapels, and leaned his head against my father's.

"Oh, Majesty," the little dragon had said, and as if to say it was alright my father had reached up and comforted Dagon the way one might a cat.

"It's the way of things, Dagon," the old king had told him. He took a few coins from his pocket and put them in the crate. "These are the last coins struck under my reign. The last ones with my face on them. I'll be gone soon, and wanted you to have these." 

A few nights later, when my father had passed, I found Dagon uneasily rearranging his coins. A quirk of his dragon nature wouldn't let him sleep and he was up most of the night restlessly rearranging them, shifting uneasily from coins my father looked young on and the ones he'd given him most recently. 

This was all years ago. Just as he had for my father before me Dagon proved to be the most wise and trustworthy council. I'd consulted him in times of war and famine, and he'd taken care of my kingdom. There were nights Dagon was sick and I'd stay in the inner vault all night, letting him sleep in my bejeweled crown, turned upside down on a table and filled with his favorite coins, which seemed to reinvigorate him. Sometimes he would leave the vault and join me, hiding in the folds of robes to whisper secrets in my ear when his wisdom and counsel was needed outside the vault. 

Tonight I'm heading to see Dagon like I have so many times before. I walked the route I'd taken countless times like my fathers had, through halls and doorways that had seen countless kings come and go. It took me longer than it used to, and some of the doors seemed to only grow heavier over the years. I passed the guards of the treasury, members of my own personal security detail who could be trusted not to harm Dagon even if they did discover him. Telling them I might be a while I closed the door of the outer vault behind me and proceeded towards the interior. When I had closed the interior vault door Dagon stirred in his crate, and his head rose on his long neck to see above the brim.

"Dagon", I said to him as I placed an aged hand on the young man next to me. "This is my son." 

The small dragon trembled terribly. "Oh, Majesty", was his only reply.

#### [WP] Every human has their soulmate's last words to them engraved in their skin from birth.

Score: 1819

She’s so beautiful. 

The second I see her my mind darts back to that little dinner party anecdote my uncle would always spout. “Well I had to travel to France,” he’d start “when your *words* are in French, you have to take the plunge. Six months I studied the language, six months I saved money for a ticket, only to find my belle chou was a stewardess on the flight!” I hate that story. He always smiled and winked at me after telling it, never knowing how much it hurt me. How was he to know, I’d never told him. I have no *words*. 

Christ, now shes smiling at me. 

My stomach lurches as I pretend to look past her, knowing I can’t put off going to her forever. Theres nothing like spending your life knowing youre destined to be alone. I’ve learned to avoid conversations when *words* come up; I feign insult and cite taboo if anyone asks directly about mine. I’ve had flings; girls have seen my unetched skin, but even when they mask their shock and dissapointment, their pity still shines through. I’ve learned to live with it. I’ve also learned they never call back afterwards.

Still, I don’t get paid for standing around moping my own misfortune. I take a deep breath and start to walk over to her table, trying and failing to look anywhere but her stunning face. I feel the colour rise in my cheeks at the same rate my stomach is sinking. Am I sweating? God I must look like an idiot to her. I clear my throat. “Good morning maam, how can I help? Coffee?” She pulls a cute appologetic face while raising her fist to her chest and moving it in a circle. I am confused. This is confusing, right? She points to her ear before theatrically shrugging her shoulders and shaking her head. I don’t see which beverage she’s pointing to on the menu, instead I just grin as I realise what’s happening. She has no words either.

Kendall had faintly heard his name spoken for the first time in nearly three years that morning. She had thought maybe she'd imagined it, but decided to run to the next room and turn up the television anyways. And there he was on the news, her long gone husband and best friend being hauled out of one of those ungodly large tanks he had left in so long ago. The banner running across the bottom of the screen simply read "Last Remaining Member of the 7th Expedition Found Alive."

*2 Hours Later*

Tears swelled in her eyes as she held Mark's hand for the first time since the morning he had left on his expedition. He looked much older now, his skin was pale and rough. A grizzled blonde beard now covered his face. Two scars now decorated one of his cheeks. His eyes faintly opened and they made eye contact for the first time. "Hey you" was all he could muster up. He smirked a little before passing out. A tear had rolled down his scarred cheek. Kendall broke down in tears of joy before the medical staff escorted her out of the room to prep for surgery.

*10 Hours Later*

Kendall had been kept in a small room in the hospital, away from any news cameras that had now surrounded the entire building. Several men in suits had come in and out throughout the night to console her and congratulate her on her husband's return. One of them was Wallace Quincy, president of the Border Exploration Agency and Mark's best friend. The last time Kendall had seen him was at Mark's funeral where she had slapped him across the face for sending him and his team out into the Borderlands. This time though she simply hugged him. 

"How is he?" she asked him. 

"Unfortunately I only know about as much as you do right now. They should be finished with the surgery by now though, so we'll know soon." He looked saddened to see her. Kendall could tell that the loss of Mark had resonated greatly on Wallace over the years. "I just want you to know that I am still so sorry for putting you through all of this.." Kendall shushed him and put a hand gently over his mouth. 

"He's back now, that's all that matters, Wally" she said with a smile. Kendall could see his face flush with relief. It was the first time Wallace had felt good about something in a very long time. A tall, frail man in a lab coat entered the room.

"He can see you now."

*The Next Day*

Kendall stood next to Mark's bed as the room filled with several important looking men and women. Most went up to Mark to shake his hand and tell him how glad they were to see him alive. Wallace came up to her after shaking some other man's hand across the room. He smiled at both of them and put his hand on Mark's shoulder. Mark put his hand on Wallace's and smiled back at him. 

"We're going to start the debrief now. Kendall, it may be tough to hear what happened, if you'd like to step out for a li.." she abruptly cut him off. 

"I'm staying" she said sternly. Wallace nodded and turned to address the others in the room to tell them that the debriefing was about to begin. Mark grabbed Kendall's hand gently and pulled her close to him. She leaned in, his voice was still faint and tired. "I saw it." he said to her and smirked the way he always had when he was about to tell her something important. "Saw what?" Kendall thought to herself. Wallace spoke up before she could ask Mark what he meant.

"Okay Mark, whenever you're ready, let's begin." Wallace said calmly. He wasn't sure he was ready to hear what the last remaining survivor of a 30 man crew he had commissioned himself had to say. Mark, still looking at Kendall, turned to face the small crowd. He leaned up slowly in his bed.

"I'm going to have to start from the beginning for this all to make sense" he said. And so he began telling his tale that was now three years in the making.

*3 Years Ago*

"The whole worlds going to be watching you know." Wallace said with a smile. Mark Osbourne raised his beer bottle with a smile.

"Lets hope we don't disappoint them then, huh?" Wallace raised his and clanked it against Mark's. 

"I wish I could head out there with you guys, you know that right?" Wallace had been studying the Borderlands for most of his adult life. A barren wasteland stretching as far as the eye could see in every direction that no man had gone more than 50 miles into. Winds that could uproot a redwood blew in every direction towards Singularis, the last major city on this godforsaken planet. Probes had been sent before, but their tracking devices began failing some 75-100 miles out. High winds in the jet stream prevented any type of probe to be sent into space as well. They were trapped here, more or less, Wallace would think to himself, and no one really seemed to ever care enough to figure out how or why. 

"I know you do buddy, I know. But these people would be lost if you left. And who would watch Kendall for me while I'm gone if you were out there with me?" Wallace shrugged, Mark was right. Besides, the lab was his home. Wallace never was one for field work and a mission of this type suited the explorers like Mark much more. The two sat in silence for several minutes, both thinking the same thing. Mark finally broke the silence. "So, what do you think we're going to find out there?" he asked. Wallace honestly didn't have an answer.

*Expedition Day One*

Several miles into the Borderlands, Mark glanced at a screen showing the rear of one of the expedition's three monolithic tanks. The skyline of Singularis faded into the distance. "That was a pretty girl you had there" a burly man sitting next to Mark exclaimed. Harold Sanders, the chief engineer of the tanks they were currently riding in, was 6' 3" when standing. His voiced was booming and echoed across the titanium hull of the tank. A great, silver beard adorned his face. His hair was slicked back down to his shoulders. He looked like one of the toughest sons of bitches Mark had ever seen. 

Mark nodded in agreement. "That she is, going to miss that girl." The expedition was slated for two years. One out and one to come back. Mark knew it wasn't going to be easy for her to have him gone for so long, but Wallace was going to keep an eye on her, and knowing she was going to be there waiting when Mark finally came back was all the motivation he needed to complete this mission. "Harold Sanders, right?" Mark extended a hand out.

"Aye, but my friends just call me Harry." He grabbed Mark's hand with a powerful grip and smirked. Mark refocused on the screens in front of him. The convoy moved slowly across the desert, and the winds had already begun to pick up and rattled the outside of the tank. Mark grabbed the radio.

"Prospect 2, this is Prospect 1. Do you copy?" he announced into the mic. There were a few seconds of static before the other end responded.

"Prospect 1, this is Prospect 2. We hear ya loud and clear over here. Might wanna check on 3 though, looks like she's slacking a bit back there" replied Prospect 2's captain. Marcus Whitewater, had a southern twang to his voice and almost never shut up, but the man knew what he was doing and Mark was glad to have him on the expedition. 

"Fuck off, Whitewater. Maybe if you knew how to drive one of these my crew wouldn't be stuck behind you guys" a cheery voice answered back on the radio. Captain Sadie Richards of Prospect 3. Mark chuckled thinking of how such a small girl could have such a big mouth. She could probably beat up Mark too though, so he'd keep that thought to himself.

"Ooh, you kiss your mother with that mouth, Cap?" Whitewater answered back. 

"Alright guys, lets keep it in check" Mark intervened. "Prospect 2, Prospect 3, all systems ready to go?"

"Aye, Captain" both responded simultaneously. 

"Lets push it then." Mark put the radio back down and looked over to Sanders and nodded. Sanders took the cue and pushed the tanks throttle forward. The engines purred loudly and the tank accelerated forward into the unknown.


*I'm going to finish the rest of this over the weekend, hopefully it's not too long by then but we'll see! Thanks for reading so far!"

"No… No, I don't wanna talk about it."

Freddy rocked back and forth on the couch, rubbing his arms like trying to shake off the cold.

"What happened, Freddy?" Jason asked, trying a hand on Krueger's shoulder. 

Krueger shivered, pulling away. "Don't! No touch!"

"Ok, ok… sorry. But you have to talk about –"

"He did things," Freddy mumbled, almost to himself. "He had powers… He made things happen."

"What? What did he make you do, Freddy?"

"No, no! I can't!"

"Freddy, if you don't talk about it, I can't –"

"I was naked at school," Freddy blurted out. "Everyone was watching. And I looked down and – and there was a 
hoodie with bunny ears on my dick, and the girls were laughing, Jason…"

Jason frowned. "What?"

"And when I tried to attack him, the bunny started talking, saying I'm a loser. Screaming 'Look at me, I'm Freddy's loser penis and I'm small!'"

"Wait… the bunny started –"

"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT THAT HAVING YOUR OWN PENIS TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE A

"But how did he make these things happen?" Jason asked, confused. "I don't under –"

"I don't know! I don't know! After a while I stopped trying to kill him, and just started asking him what the fuck 
was going on!"

"And what did he say?"

Freddy paused. "Nothing," he mumbled, finally. "But my bunny penis told me to go fuck myself."

Jason scratched his head. "That doesn't make any sense, Freddy. How could he be controlling the dream?"

"I don't know, Jason," Freddy said, looking up. "But I'm afraid to fall asleep again. I'm so afraid that… that…"

"Shh, it's fine," Jason whispered, pulling Freddy's face to his shoulder. "It's fine. It's over now…*loser*."

Freddy's eyes went wide. Slow and terrified, he looked up. Jason had bunny ears sprouting from his hockey mask, a 
creepy look behind his hollow eyes.

"No… no, please, no!"

"What's wrong? Something bothering you, Freddy?" Jason asked, holding Freddy's head just a little tighter to his shoulder. "Cause you can tell me, whatever it is. No matter how *small* it seems to you."

"No. No, I gotta wake up!" Freddy yelled, trying to break free from Jason's grasp. "I gotta wake up, this is not real! Don't, please, I –"

But even as he spoke he heard the cough.

Slowly, he pulled his eyes down to his crotch.  

His penis was looking up, a look of disapproval behind half-spectacles.

"God, you are such a disappointment, Freddy," the penis said, and Freddy broke into tears once more.

#### [WP] An alien invasion happens during an alien invasion.

Score: 1801

It’s funny how naïve science fiction writers were. They assumed we would be on the same level as aliens – that our battles would be fought on even ground. They egotistically thought that humans might even have an edge for our “special” upbringing on Earth.

But space is big. Really big. By the time, we finally found a way to quickly traverse it, we figured out the truth. Space isn’t the biggest boundary separating alien civilizations. 

The universe formed 14 billion years ago, and it’s been habitable for much of that time. In comparison, our ape ancestors “only” appeared a few tens of millions of years ago, and we’ve only been able to reach out into the void for about a hundred years now. 

Time is the boundary that truly separates life. It’s likely that in the whole Milky Way, there is no alien race that is exactly on our technology level. There are perhaps millions of races that are eons behind us, and many more that are just as far ahead. Some aliens are but ants to us. If we desired, we could crush them without a second thought. Other aliens, however, are gods. Their technological capability is beyond our understanding, beyond anything we could ever dream.

With such technological disparity, it seems almost inevitable that the universe is one giant game of predator and prey. As a young species just entering the galactic community, we are prey to all and predator to none. Some men dream of finding worlds that we can colonize, worlds where we can be the predators, but they don’t realize that we’re millions, even billions of years behind. 

Until recently, we believed that maybe we’re late bloomers, billions of years late – that maybe we don’t have a place in this universe. If the universe is cold and unforgiving, the old and strong swallowing up the younger, weaker species, what chance did we have? With such powerful alien civilizations already in power around the galaxy, how could we even make it a hundred years without being crushed by a superior force?

Four days ago, an alien species of unknown origin entered the solar system. Their ships were incomprehensibly fast, and their strange weaponry tore through our defenses with little to no resistance. In a matter of minutes, the human defense was shattered. We were broken and vulnerable. The Earth and her colonies were ripe for the taking, a useful colony world to these dominant aliens.

They descended upon our colonies, rounding us up in billions. They vaporized our structures and facilities and built their own. At this moment, we knew there was nothing special about us. We were a small, insignificant species whose fate was at the mercy of this superior race.

But then they arrived. We called them the Arbiters, even though we never saw one in person. They sent one ship, the size of a small car. At this sight, the invaders scattered and ran, abandoning their projects and leaving our solar system. But they were too slow for the Arbiter ship – in an instant, it unleashed whatever arcane forces it had at its command, and the invaders completely disappeared. Our planets somehow reverted to their pre-invasion state, and indeed the only remaining evidence of the invasion was in our memories.

It was at that moment that we understood. This was how the prey survived. This was how civilizations were allowed to form.

It was at that moment that we made the choice. We abandoned our dreams of conquest and victory. We wouldn’t become invaders. We would become Arbiters.

So I bought an island deep in the Pacific, one accessible by helicopter alone, and transported ten orphans there, all aged seven. And I had them huts built, and tools designed, and jobs designated.  Then I would leave them for ten years to their own capabilities, but first I gathered them for a speech. 

"Welcome," I said, my polished shoes digging into the sand beach and suit flapping as I spread my arms, "Welcome to your new home. A home I gave to you. A home with resources, with food, with all you need to survive. Given to you by me. Remember me, children. Your benefactor. Your reason for survival. Whisper my name at night when you are scared and I will protect you. Call out to me when hungry and I will provide."

"But what should we do to entertain ourselves?" Asked the smallest of the children, "what about television, and books?"

"If you're good, I shall provide them. I provide all things if you're good."

The child nodded slowly, his eyes scrunched together in half comprehension, and the group watched my helicopter rise from the beach. Then I was gone. 

On the island, food and water were programmed to rise out of the ground overnight when my name was spoken. And the forest was programmed to make bear growls, tiger roars, and wolf howls each night until my name was spoken, though there were no natural predators. 

The ten years passed quickly- there was much else on my mind. I bought a sports team, American baseball, and it was steadily climbing the rankings under my guidance and, more importantly, my quiet funding. I married again, and there was the funeral of my second wife to attend to. And of course, there was my own son, ready to start leaving for college in a year's time. 

But when I flew back to the island, I knew what to expect. Ten children, plus or minus a few from births or deaths, all calling out my name. Ten children that had proved an excellent point, and would make excellent servants. 

No crowd gathered on the beach when I arrived. No one stepped forth from their huts with religious fervor. 

All was silent as I trudged through the camp. And with a long, slender finger, I pushed one of the huts doors open, and looked inside. 

A skeleton. One years dead, with no flesh left on its bones, alone on its cot, and with hollow eyes that stared at the ceiling. 

I yelped and stepped back out of the door frame, examining the rest of the huts. 

Nine other skeletons. One for each of the children. 

"Oh God," I whispered. Ten years had gone to waste. "But how?"

I checked the island controls, and found the solution to the problem. Nine years before, the food delivery mechanism had jammed. And ten children had starved. 

I cursed. There was no time for incidents such as this. To prepare another island, to find ten more children, to wait ten more years- it was all too inconvenient. 

So I walked back to my helicopter, a frown creasing my lips, and deep in thought. 

But on the way, I heard a noise, and realized I must have forgotten to disable the controls speakers. On returning, the volume knobs were down, but as I walked to the helicopter I heard it again. A rustling. A mumbling. 

I walked faster, and heard more sounds behind me. But whenever I turned back, the path behind me was empty. 

I jumped into the helicopter, slamming the door shut, and started the engine. But it wouldn't start. There was no response from the machine. 

"Come on," I shouted, kicking at the pedals, "Come on!"

But nothing happened. Nothing except for a small knock at the door. 

And then the door opened, and there were ten children, all staring at me with smiles on their faces. Their clothes were slightly more ragged, their faces slightly more aged, but otherwise no different than how I had left them. 

"How?" I whispered, straining away from them, but the seatbelt held me in place, "You all died.  How are you here?"

The smallest one laughed then spoke, his eyes on me, "Oh Mr. Don, surely you remember. What sort of God doesn't provide resurrection? We were good, and you provided."

#### [WP] After a 1000 year slumber, the ancient dragons emerge once more... and find that they really like the modern world.

Score: 1789

His back against the alley wall, Greenscale took a deep breath and let the fire out slow like cigarette smoke. 

"Come on, Green, lunch ended ten minutes ago," the manager said, sticking his head out the back door then 
disappearing back inside.

Green got up, sighed and went back inside the bank.

This was not the life he wanted. This was not what he expected when he first woke up to the modern world. It was not how he thought he'd spend his middle age.

"I have these quarters," the old lady said to him, leaning on the counter with a big bag of coins. "I'd like to trade 
them for bills."

Greenscale poured the coins on the counter and started counting.

Hotbreath, his cousin, was traveling with the circus. Firemouth was shooting Game of Thrones in Scotland. 
Sharpteeth and Longtail were doing fire shows for Kanye West Concerts.

Every dragon seemed to have an exciting life but him.

"You're a dragon, you guys are good with money," they told him, after he had applied for the new Hobbit movie. 
"Maybe try something in banking."

Greenscale didn't want to be a banker. He had higher hopes than that, growing up.

"Here you go, madam," Greenscale said, counting the bills in front of the old lady.

"I think there was one more dollar there. Can you count the coins again?"

Greenscale sighed, and a sliver of smoke rose from his nostrils. He turned back to restart the counting.

&nbsp;

The bar was almost empty. Only a couple of drunks and an old lady under the spotlight onstage.

"What can I get you, dragonboy?" the barman greeted him. "A Fireball?"

Very funny," Greenscale said, leaning on the counter. "But yeah… shot of Fireball sounds good."

The barman poured, and Greenscale downed it in one motion.

His grandfather, the great BurningNostrils, had been a tower dragon. He had kidnapped a princess and all. The guy 
was a legend. Greenscale's father, Burningmouth, had terrorized a whole village for a hundred years.

Growing up, Greenscale didn't know that the time of princesses and villages were long gone. 

"Another one," Greenscale said. He turned around on his stool. Out the window it was almost morning.

&nbsp;

Greenscale stepped out to the cold morning air, miserable. Why did every dragon seemed to have a good life but 
him?

More than once, Greenscale had thought about buying some gasoline, drinking it… and hiccuping. He pushed 
those thoughts away every time, but they were getting more and more frequent.

"Excuse me…"

He turned his drunken gaze down. A little boy had big eyes turned up to him. "Are you a real dragon?"

"Yeah…" Greenscale said, resuming his stumble. "I think so..."

"Cool! Do you wanna play with me?"

He stopped and looked back again. The kid had a wooden sword and a plastic helmet under his arms. "I can be the 
knight, and you can be the dragon, and we can pretend the princess is under that box." The kid turned to his mother, who was getting groceries out of a car. "Mom, can I play with the dragon? *Pleaaase*?"

The woman looked Greenscale up and down, as if measuring his worthiness. "Yes, honey, but stay where I can see you."

"Great!" the kid turned to Greenscale. "So? You wanna?"

Greenscale kept his eyes on the boy. "I'm not sure kid..."

"I'm sorry, it's just that I never met a real dragon…" the kid said. "And I don't have any friends to play with."

"Yeah… yeah, ok. I'll play with you," Greenscale said, stepping back towards the boy. 

"Good!" The boy assumed fighting position and put on his helmet. "Now… step away, dragon! You're not gonna get 
the princess!"

"Yes I am!" Greenscale said, rising up and spreading his wings. He thought back on his father and grandfather, and 
he felt happy. For a second, he felt proud. "She is my prisoner!"

"Well I'm gonna set her free!"

"No you won't!" 

The kid raised his sword. "Yes I will!"

Greenscale felt joy like he never felt before. A sense of belonging, of doing what he was supposed to. For the first time in many years, he felt like he was part of something bigger than him.

"I'm going to kill you now, dragon!" the kid yelled, charging forward.

The feeling grew inside Greenscale's chest. For once, he felt like a dragon. He felt powerful, important. Scary.

He took a deep breath, closed his eyes. He felt the warmth growing inside his belly, chest and throat. With one swing of his head, he released a tremendous gush of fire, like he never had before.

The kid was carbonized instantly, crumbling to no more than a small pile of ashes on the ground.

Because you don't let your kids play with dragons, for God's sake.

#### [WP] You have a special bag. Whenever you reach into it, you pull out something you will need soon, but don't necessarily know you need yet. However, the things you are pulling out of the bag have been very strange recently.

Score: 1788

Duct tape. Three feet of rope. A pink dress on a wire hanger. 

The time I pulled out a monkey wrench, I guessed there was a plumbing problem. I went to the basement, and there was a leaky pipe. Another time, I pulled out a bandage, and figured a cut was coming. Ten minutes later, despite my caution, I brushed against an upholstery tack that had just come loose from my couch. Once, I was mildly surprised by the bottle of 10w-30 oil I pulled out, until a neighbor came over and asked for a lift to a gas station to buy one. 

A toy gun. A wireless router. A second roll of duct tape. A bottle of water. 

The bag lets me know it has something useful by suddenly feeling full. I mean, it's empty otherwise, but suddenly it's lumpy and heavier, depending on the weight. Usually, that is once a week, maybe twice. Today, every five minutes. 

A pair of running shoes. A Mexican passport with my picture in it. A hollow bible with a flask hidden in it. The flask feels full. 

I pull out my phone and call my best friend, Phil. I tell him to come over, because something weird is going on. He tells me he can't, because there are police at his house right now, looking for me. The bag gets heavy again. Pretty heavy this time. 

A fat suit. Like, a skin colored latex costume to make a person look fat. Hollywood grade, and matching my skin tone. And a backpack. 

Well, shit. I decide--on a hunch--to tape the gun, passport, and wireless router (and a short cat5 cable) to my belly and put on the fat suit. The other stuff, and the remaining tape, I stuff into the backpack. I don't put on the dress, because it's too small even without the fat suit. I pull on my now-too-tight clothes and the backpack just as I hear a pounding at the door. 

I answer. I get punched in the face. I wake up in a barren room. My stuff has been rifled through, but they didn't take anything. Well, except my magic bag. Bastards. 

Well, I pull out the gun (toy) and the router from under my fat suit. I test the door, and of course it is locked. Hmm. I take the flask out and smell the contents... whew, it's ether. I put the lid back on. I look through the keyhole, and can't see anything. It's an old style door (sturdy as hell, though) with a skeleton key style lock--I should be able to see through... unless... 

I bend the wire hangar back and forth until it breaks. I make a wide, flat, sticky sheet by overlapping strips of duct tape and slide it under the door. I poke the wire through the keyhole... clank. I slide the sheet back, and use the key that was stuck to the tape to open the door. I gather my things and exit. 

I'm on the 2nd floor, and can see a stairway. I can see someone at the bottom, asleep in a chair. I soak the pink dress in the ether, and quietly sneak down. Soon, the guy is really out cold, and tied to his chair. I hear the door open. I pull my gun and whirl. A surprised guy puts his hands up, and is soon duct taped to another chair, also out cold. 

When they come to, I interrogate them. The hangar proves useful again, as does the ether. Looks like their partner headed to Juarez to sell the magic bag. I plug in the router to a phone jack in the room, and use one of the thug's smartphones to book a flight using my new passport. Guess I'm headed south. I pull out the water bottle the magic bag had provided. Curious, because while I am thirsty, water is not exactly hard to find. I look at the label. Bottled by the Archdiocese of New York? Holy water? Looks like this is going to be an interesting trip.

***



Emperor Xen So waved a wrinkled hand from the podium he stood behind, and Executioner Jin cut someone's head clean from their shoulders. 

The man had been a killer. Murdered three children in cold blood. His name was Wei and he had been trying to find immortality. But now his head was rolling across the floor. *I guess it didn't turn out so well for him.* The executioner gripped the severed head by its hair, and turned it to face the Emperor. 

The man smiled, thinking he'd suddenly gained hundreds of years of life. But in truth, Jin could something emanating from the body, and drifting to himself. His head felt lighter, and he fought the urge to sway on his feet. It was an unpleasant business, but he'd rather take Wei's life than let anyone else have it. The Emperor smiled at himself. Little did he know, the power didn't come to who the head faced, but who had removed it. 

The elderly Emperor Xen So bowed and gave a single clap. The massive crowds that had attended the execution slowly dispersed, disappointed looks on their faces. *They all hoped for a slice of the man's essence.* Jin shook his head at the scene. If they knew the truth of it, what it really meant to take an essence, the crowd would be nonexistent. 

Executioner Jin rested his halberd on a wall and watched the people leave. He could hear faint murmurs of conversation. Being alive so long, his senses were  well above anyone else's. 

"...Felt it. I really did!" He heard a child exclaim to his mother. 

"I think I did too." She replied, slowly.

"How much do you think we got? A year?" He tugged on the sleeve of her dress.

The woman shrugged. "Oh I don't know. It didn't feel like too much. Perhaps a few months." The child nodded at the answer, somewhat satisfied.  

Jin sighed and turned back to the stage he was on. Servants were arriving to clean the area and remove Wei's body. 

A girl, one Ni Xo, appeared and began to inspect the deceased. "Do you think that he has any..." she gestured vaguely. "Left?" 

Jin forced a weak smile. His head still felt light. "I couldn't say for sure." He lied. The words came to him slowly, like thinking through a vat of molasses. The girl smiled and began prodding at the body. "You'd do well to stop fingering it." He called. Ni Xo looked up, blushing. 

"Right... sorry." She muttered. The servant stood and went with the others, to clean up the stage. 

He watched them for a few moments, until the crowds had fully left the place. Jin nodded to himself and collected his halberd. He needed rest. 

His chambers were modest, and yet their position in the palace made them worth more money than any man could possibly own. It held a bed, dresser and a trunk full of personal effects. Pieces from past lives that he had lived. For each ruler he served, for each job he held, each name he wore, Jin would take something to remember it by. He still hadn't anything for the life he was living now. The token usually came at the beginning of a life or at the end. 

Jin rested by the foot of his bed. His mind had cleared up now, his thoughts came quick and properly formed. It had taken the better part of two hours for it to do so, though. That meant... what? Three hundred and fifty years taken? *No, closer to three hundred, I think.* There was a time, many many years ago, when Jin had dedicated a life to figuring out how it all worked. Back then he had been called Marrow, and he had worked under a king in the east. Marrow had spent a considerable amount of time on research, but never truly understood it all. 

He figured that his time as 'Jin the Executioner' was coming to a close. Emperor Xen So was old and of the false belief that he would live for a millennium. He ate poorly and drank like a normal man took in air. His skin was flabby and wrinkled. Telling signs that he hadn't taken in any essence. Jin was no physician, but he gave the man less than a year until he died. 

"And that's when it will all fall apart." Jin mused. They'd realise that their emperor had been cheated, and they'd come to kill him. They'd fail, and Jin would leave to find some other half-wit leader to serve under. He looked to his trunk, across the room. "How many kings, emperors, masters and gods has it been?" Jin asked himself. "Perhaps one day, put all I've learnt from them to use." *Perhaps.* 

He slept little that night, for he knew something was wrong. 

Come morning, he heard cries from outside his room, and the rush of several footsteps. Jin rose and collected his halberd. Any minute now, they'd come barging in. The captain of the guards, the royal advisor, the heir, or whoever the hell else thought they'd been cheated. 

Jin stood by the door waiting. Listening through the doors he heard muffles of conversations. Words like "succession," "immortality," and "essence," were thrown around a lot. 

A time later, there came a knock on his door. 

"Enter." Jin called. 

The door creaked open. In the hall stood four men, almost all were armored from head to toe. The one in the centre, the captain did not wear a helm. He pointed a finger at the executioner. 

"See how he carries his weapon? He knows what has happened and knows that he his guilty." The man said. His men grunted in agreement.

Jin clutched his halberd tightly. "So, Emperor Xen So has died?" 

Some of the men nodded. The captain narrowed his eyes. 

"Know that it was not my fault, but Xen So himself's." Jin started, "You men would be wise to walk away and let me leave. You'd never see me again." 

The captain shook his head, and drew his sword. "You shall befall the same fate that you dolled out to so many others." 

Jin rolled his eyes and lowered his halberd. The captain advanced on Jin, with a slash of his sword. The executioner backed further into his tiny room. He parried the captain's blows, though they came hard and strong. 

Jin pulled away, and returned his attacks. He brought his weapon's blade high over his head and sent it down. The captain ducked out of the way, letting the halberd crash into the carpet. Another guard entered the room. Jin turned his focus to the new man. He was on him before the man could react. Jin cut through the guard's plate mail with an upwards slash, removing his left arm completely.  The guard cried out and fell to his knees, clutching at his stump. The executioner kicked him to floor, but did not kill the man. 

He felt something pierce his loose robes, and looked down to find a sword embedded in his stomach. Jin grunted and stepped back, allowing the blade to slip free. The captain smiled as the sword came out, spraying blood on his robes, and slashed at Jin's head. Jin raised an arm to block the blow. The sword caught deep in his forearm, stopping only at the bone. The bleeding at his waist had subsided.

The captain's smile faded as he struggled to wrench the blade loose. Jin, with his free hand, drove the point of his halberd deep into the captain's gut. He pushed him back against the wall, and threw his weight into the blow. There was a *crunch* as the tip of the halberd pierced armour, leather and then intestines. Jin pulled his weapon free, and in one smooth motion spun around and sunk the blade into the neck of an advancing guard. 

The poor man tried to staunch the bleeding as he dropped, gurgling. Jin ripped the captain's sword from his arm, and watched as the wound slowly healed itself. The bone grew back, whilst muscle and skin re-knit itself around the wound. *There goes one hundred years.*

Jin raised his head to see that the last guard had left. He spat on the floor at the betrayal, though it worked to his advantage. Then, looking to the captain he knelt down to meet his eyes. 

"What... are you?" The man stammered, through coughs of blood. 

Jin gripped at an eagle--the symbol of Xen So--pinned to the man's chest and ripped it free. His token. "I am no one." He said.

Earth was never meant to live this long. 

She was supposed to die with her sister, Mars, years ago. She's been sick, plagued by ice age chills, fever swings, and marks on her complexion. 

But I knew Earth when she was beautiful, and now that she's not, I still remember. 

It's a shame I can only see her every seventy years. But that's the rules of the cosmos, as the mathamatical gears of the universes laws bring us together and sperate again. Our relationshio was long distance, but each time I returned, she looked worse, more tiresome, more feeble. 

"Earth," I cried, swinging by her in an arcing hug, "Earth, you cannot leave me now.  You cannot leave me alone, to travel in this solar system for seventy years, and have only sadness when I finally reach you."

"Halley, my comet, my love." Said Earth in my embrace, "I fear I am near my end. I have waited this long to see you, and I do not know if I can wait again."

"No," I cried, "Surely there is a way. A way for me to spend the rest your days with you."

Earth was silent, then she said, "There is one way. I will fill a creature with my spirit, but my spirit will sleep until you arrive. Seventy years alseep, and one awake, and I will spend all those ones with you."

So Earth poured her spirit into a new being she named man, and every seventy years, as I flew back, she awoke. Now millions of eyes watch me pass, and I see her in every one of them. But though she ages slower, death still comes for her. It comes as her spirit slowly falters in men, and they forget her, and she departs their bodies an minds, and they too will fall to waste. 

But until that time will pass, I get to see her every seventy years. She sees me every one of her waking days. 

I now leave a sparkling tail, as tears fall behind me, because I fear her last day is soon.  

And even though she has so little left, men depart her with the remaining bits of her spirit, stealing it from me, traveling where I shall never see her again.

"Everything I could ever want?" I asked.

"Everything you could ever want," replied the Devil.

"And what if 'everything I could ever want' includes not having to give you my soul?"

The Devil chuckled. "Oh, I'm not here to ask for your soul."

And that was how I ended up on a date with Gertrude.

---

I arrived at the park right when Gertrude did. She was wearing jeans and a button-up shirt, looking more like a college student than literal hellspawn.

"Hey! I'm Phil," I said. *Do I shake her hand? A hug?*

She kept her hands in her pockets and didn't quite meet my eyes. "So I know my dad put you up to this, but thanks anyways. I don't get out much," said Gertrude. She smiled but was still looking down.

I smiled back. "It's my pleasure." I thought about the prize that awaited me. *Everything I could ever want.*

There was some initial tension as we walked, but she was a lot easier to talk to than I'd anticipated.

"So, like, do you have a last name?" I asked.

She furrowed one brow. "What?"

"Like, is it just Gertrude?"

"Oh, one sec." She snapped her fingers and a driver's license materialized in her hands.

"Holy shit," I said as she handed it to me. I studied it for a few seconds. Where the name should have been, there were just some symbols that looked like something you'd see on a Led Zeppelin album cover. I wasn't sure what was weirdest: the magic I'd just seen, the weird symbols, or the fact that the state of Montana had apparently issued this license. "This is awesome."

She chuckled. "If you thought that was cool, check this out." She snapped her fingers again and thick dark clouds quickly enveloped the sky. I started hearing shrieks from all around the park. She snapped her fingers again, and the clouds retreated.

"Oh my God," I said, "that was incredible."

Her smiled disappeared. "Please don't say that."

"What, 'incredible?' It was!"

"No, the previous thing."

"You mean 'Oh my God?'" I thought for a second. "Oh. *Oooooh*. Yeah. Sorry."

"It's alright," she said. Her smile returned.

We spent the rest of the afternoon doing arcane magicks and bonding over our common love of classic rock. She'd been alive for time immemorial, but in her opinion, human music had only really been any good between 1965 and 1982.

As the sun started to set, I realized we'd spent the entire day together, and I never wanted it to end.

"Gertrude," I said.

"Yeah?"

"I really liked getting to know you. Can I see you again?"

She smiled. "Of course."

I smiled back, and went in for a kiss.

I realized then that the Devil had already made good on his promise. Gertrude was everything I had ever wanted.

"Sorry," I whisper, fumbling through the giant messy pile in my bag looking for the communicator. "Just my phone, sorry. I'll turn it off..." I finally wrap my fingers around the little round device and pretend to look at the caller ID of my 'phone.' 

"Oh, this is actually important," I tell him. "Please, give me a moment?" 

He nods, but I can still see the subtle glance at his watch as I scamper around the corner to the bathroom. It's the mayor, of course. Part of me hesitates: do I *really* want to answer this? I'm two glasses of wine in already, and it can't be *that* urgent if my super-hearing isn't picking up any sirens... And the date is going so well! As if on cue, the wail of police cruisers and firetrucks reaches me. *Damn, I jinxed myself*. I grumble and slip on my mask. 

"What is it, mayor?" I answer. I'm staring daggers at him through the video monitor, hoping that he realizes that I'm busy

"Oh, Ms. Magnificent!! So glad you're there! We need your help!"

I roll my eyes. *You wouldn't be calling me if you didn't need help. Get to the point!*

"It's Professor Carnage again!" The mayor shouts, practically in hysterics. "He's planted bombs in the city's electrical grid! They're set to go off in forty five minutes!! And there are too many for us to disarm at once! We need your help!"

"I..." my mind desperately searches for some other way around the problem. Part of me wants to just tell the mayor that electricity really isn't that important.

"Please, come as quickly as possible!!!" The poor man is almost crying now. 

"I'll be there as soon as I can," I tell him through clenched teeth.

I return to table, where Isaac is waiting with a raised eyebrow.

"Manage to calm your other boyfriend?" he teases. His smile fades when he sees the expression on my face.

"I'm so so so sorry to have to do this," I tell him. "I really am. I just need to run out for like half an hour. I swear. Please, stay here. Please."

He looks at his watch again, not even trying to hide it this time. "Well, I..."

"Please," I cut him off. "It's an emergency at work. And I swear it will only take me a half hour. Maybe less!" *How hard could it be to get rid of a few bombs?* Before he can even answer, I signal to the waiter. "Get this man the best dessert you've got, and a glass of your finest scotch." 

Isaac finally smiles and relents. "I'm leaving in half an hour, though," he tells me. 

I lean down and kiss him deeply on the lips. "No, you'll wait," I tease him. "It'll be worth it."

His normally quick mind can't think of a response, and I hustle out the door before he distracts me again.

----

True to my word, I am back in half an hour. The mayor's men had already found most of the bombs, so it was simply a matter of collecting them all and carrying them out to sea where they can safely detonate. Disarming them would take too long anyway. Luckily I can fly pretty quickly.

"Well, well," he says with a haughty grin. "Looks who's back."

I give him another kiss and pull him from the chair. "Come on," I tell him. "I'm ready for the rest of the date!" 

He walks me out to the car, where the driver is waiting. Always the perfect gentleman, he holds the door for me and offers me a hand for balance. Good thing, too: I'm not really used to high heels. 

"One last thing," he tells me as the car accelerates down the street. "This last part is a bit of a surprise, so you're going to need to put this on over your eyes." He holds out a black scarf of some kind. I laugh, not sure if he's serious, but he is. He doesn't really know that I can see through it, or that my hearing is acute enough to use echolocation, but it's a very nice gesture nonetheless.

After a short ride, we arrive at our destination: The Mt. Portage Observatory tower. 

"Can I take off the blindfold yet?" I ask, playing my part perfectly.

He checks his watch again and frowns. "Um, not yet," he says. He removes his phone from his pocket and pecks at it furiously with his finger, brow furrowed in frustration. "Just another minute or so," he says. He pokes at it again and again, and nothing happens. 

"All right," he says, untying it for me. 

I gasp in 'surprise' at the beautiful view, but my smile is certainly genuine. 

"There's supposed to be a meteor shower," he says, gesturing at the picnic and chilled bottle of champagne that he has had laid out for us. "And I thought that we'd be able to see it well from up here." He tries to sound upbeat, but I can still hear the disappointment in his voice. "But... well, never mind."

#### [WP] Your English teacher explains the themes and symbolismes of up a best selling book she does not know you wrote. Unfortunately, she has it all wrong. You raise your hand

Score: 1773

"It's interesting to note the choice of rats as an instrument of torture in 1984," Mrs. Garfield said in her soft voice. "It is, of course, Orwell's way of comparing the human condition under a totalitarian regime to that of a lab rat. Always following instructions, always bumping against walls… working for the benefit of powers he cannot understand."

George Orwell exchanged looks with his friends. From the corner of the class, a twelve year old Shakespeare nodded lightly, encouraging him to speak.

George Orwell raised his hand.

"Yes, Mr. Largewood?"

They all had chosen fake names, of course. When, during the annual time travelers party, the group of authors 
decided to go to the future masked as little kids, they had collectively agreed on fake names, for safety. The only restriction was that the names had to be somehow related to the male genitalia.

"I'm sorry, Mrs. Garfield, but I don't think you're right."

"Oh, you don’t?"

"Nope. In fact, I suspect Mr. Orwell's choice of rats as a form of torture stems from his irrational fear of rats."

"And how do you know George Orwell had a fear of rats, Mr. Largewood?"

Another hand shot into the air. "If I may intervene," Tolkien tried, in a low voice, "I think it was widely known by the 
literary society of the time that George Orwell was both terrified of rats and a fan of hentai pornography."

Orwell turned an angry look at Tolkien. "Hentai didn't even exist in the forties!"

Tolkien smirked. "Well, you'd know."

"Silence!" Mrs. Garfield narrowed her eyes at Tolkien. "Mr. Roundballs, please, where did you get that information?"

"I read it on the internet, Mrs. Garfield."

"Well, you're wrong. Just like you were wrong about Shakespeare having two penises. And about Jack Kerouac 
having a secret cousin who invested in the oil industry, giving him the motivation to write about road trips."

Jack Kerouac leaned forward and whispered in Charles Dickens' ear: "That one's actually true."

"Silence, Mr. Shaft!" Mrs. Garfield turned from Jack Kerouac back to Tolkien. "And you're also wrong, Mr. Roundballs, in thinking that Tolkien only wrote The Lord of the Rings because he had a fetish for hairy feet."

"It's not a fetish so much as a healthy preference for –"

"Enough!" Mrs. Garfield looked around the room. "I don't know where you all are getting your information, but I can guarantee you are wrong. Now let's move on. Who was in charge of reading The Hitchhikers Guide to the 
Galaxy?"

Douglas Adams raised his hand from the last row of the class.

"And what did you think, Mr. Sweatyboner?"

"I thought it was a bit pretentious."

"Really?"

"Yes, I feel like I couldn't relate to the author at all."

Mrs. Garfield smiled at the first normal observation in her class that day. "That's a very interesting point, Mr. Sweatyboner. Did you know Douglas Adams also used the rat metaphor to discuss the human condition?"

"Of course I know, I wrote the bloody book."

"Excuse me?"

"I said of course I know, I read the bloody book," Douglas said quickly, after being elbowed by Homer.

"Well, what did you think of it?" Mrs. Garfield turned her eyes at Homer. "And stop elbowing your classmates, Mr. 
Goldencum."

"I think Mr. Adams thought the image of rats ruling the world was pretty hilarious."

"And…"

"And nothing. That's it. That's the whole reason he used the rat thing. Just like the number 42."

Mrs. Garfield shook her head. "There's a whole deal of symbolism behind the choice of the number 42 as the 
meaning of life, Mr. Sweatyboner. In numerology, for example, 42 is –"

"It's a random number!" Douglas interrupted. "I just wanted to pick a random number that sounded random! 
That's the only reason why the joke is funny, because the number is random and has no meaning! If you give meaning to the number, there's no joke!"

Shakespeare leaned closer. "Relax, Douglas, we're here for the laughs. No stress."

Mrs. Garfield was shaking her head in front of the class. "You all need to study a lot more. You need to learn your 
Shakespeares and your Adamses and your Dickensens and your Kerouacs. I'm disappointed."

"Hey, no Tolkiens?"

"And your Tolkiens. Thank you, Mr. Roundballs."

Asimov got up, eyes on his wristwatch. "Guys, it's time to go. The time warp will close soon."

All the authors got up. Mrs. Garfield frowned. "What is going on?"

"Nothing!" Jack Kerouac replied. "Thank you for a wonderful class, Mrs. Garfield!"

The group gathered at the center of the room and, with a low *whoosh*, vanished from sight.

Mrs. Garfield blinked repeatedly, staring blankly at the rest of the students in the classroom. No one said a word.

One second went by. Then another. Then five. Then ten.

Finally, the focus returned to Mrs. Garfield's eyes. She scanned the room with a semi-smile, clapped her hands and 
said: "All right, classroom. What do you guys think psycho_alpaca wanted to convey with all the penis references in this story?"

#### [WP] Equivalent Exchange is the absolute law in the universe you live in. If you gain something, you will lose something equivalent in value, and vice versa. One day, you won a $10 billion lottery. You try to find out what price you have paid.

Score: 1763

Everything was going so well. I'd had a run of good luck recently, including a new job and an amazing new boyfriend. So I *knew* I had it coming; something bad was bound to happen soon. Instead of waiting for fate to catch up with me, I was proactive: I played the lottery.

It's generally a very safe bet. Billions of people on the planet play every round to discharge some good luck, just like I did. It's seen as the perfect chance to get a negative result (to counter a positive) for a lot of events. And the winner is almost always some poor farmer in the 3rd world who just lost all of his family to ebola or something. Someone with such a bad streak of luck that only a jaw-dropping amount of money can make up for it. In other words, someone not the least bit like me.

----

I wasn't even watching the results of the lottery when they were announced. I bought a bunch of tickets at once, figuring that a hundred or so losses would be enough to level things back out. I just picked "2" for every single number, on every single ticket. I dropped them in the passenger seat of my car and never gave it another thought. Until there was a knock on my door.

"Cindy Pulaski?" the man asked, shoving a microphone into my face as cameras crowded behind him. 

"What... what is all this?" I asked, still half-asleep. The coffee wasn't even done brewing yet. 

"You won!" someone shouted from behind the reporter. "You won the lottery!"

I blinked and tried to clear the sleep from my eyes. Maybe this was still a dream. 

"What's going on?" Sean asked from the kitchen. I could the distant tinkle of cereal clinking against the bowl as he prepared his breakfast. "Who is it?"

I slammed the door shut. "No one," I answered, locking the back door too. "It was no one."

-----

Hiding didn't work. The news crews camped out on my lawn, and the official from the World Lottery had already flown in from Dubai with the giant check. Eventually I emerged from the house and had to accept the burden. Lights flashed and cameras clicked, and my image would be in every newspaper by tomorrow. Somewhere in Africa there were probably a lot of starving people wondering what I'd suffered through to deserve this boon. But I knew that it wasn't what I'd gone through: it was what was coming next.

I tried to avoid the news. By now, they'd dug up stuff about my past. About how Sean and I had just started dating only a few months ago. About the new job. Every single aspect of my life was weighed on a giant scale to determine what fate had in mind, and all of the commentators were in agreement: I'd probably be killed. Something really horrific. Tortured, maybe. Fate had deigned to give me this massive amount of money and fame, and would soon extract its price. "She should live it up," one of the commentators said with grim satisfaction, "because who knows how long she'll be able to enjoy all of that money."

Sean was out the door after less than a month. Part of it was the stress of dealing with all of the press and the speculation about my imminent demise, and part of it was that he didn't want to be in the house when the meteor struck in the middle of a tornado centered in our living room. He confessed that he'd been on the fence about us even before the lottery win, and that it just wasn't worth the effort. He wanted someone more low maintenance. 

The news followed our breakup closely. Sean, the "Billion Dollar Boyfriend" did all of the talk show circuits as everyone tried to figure out what made him so amazing that the only way to balance out our impending breakup was to make me one of the richest people on the planet. Last I saw on the cover of a tabloid, he ended up with some supermodel. Makes me wonder what will eventually happen to him to level everything out. 

My friends had a pretty similar reaction. I became toxic. Even after giving away a lot of the money to charities, they still didn't think that my luck had balanced out. Donating to charity isn't bad luck, they told me. It's a choice. So something bad was still going to happen. And they didn't want to be there when it did happen.

Naturally I was fired from my job. My boss expected that the run of bad luck would be some catastrophic mistake that I'd make and sink the entire company with one typo. It wasn't unprecedented, and he wasn't willing to take that chance. He'd worked hard to build up the company and didn't want it ruined just so that I could pretend I was still a normal person with a normal job. 

----

It's been two years since I won the lottery, and one year since I last spoke to another person face to face. I moved out to a new place in the country, after all of my neighbors petitioned to get me out of the neighborhood so that whenever my catastrophe struck, they wouldn't be casualties too. I live alone now, far out in the woods. I even made my sister adopt my dog; I couldn't bear for anything to happen to him. 

It's just a waiting game now. Waiting for the end to come when my bad luck strikes me down and ends this suffering.

#### [WP] In your days you were the best con-artist in town, now you are a sweet old lady. One day a young fellow approaches you with your patented con! Time to school this kid.

Score: 1762

"Why of course, come in.  I have biscuits fresh out of the oven, and tea on the kettle that I just couldn't let go cold."

The young man stood on my porch, my tabby Mr. Scruffles purring as he rubbed against his leg while Lola meowed from a few feet away. Lola was smarter than Mr. Scruffles, because Lola could smell a liar. 

The man followed me in, his walk boasting confidence and his clothes assuring professionalism. Neither of which, I of course would know, were genuine. 

"So you were saying something about money?" I asked in my best grandmotherly voice when he was seated at my table, three cookies and two biscuits loaded up on his plate. 

"Yes, Miss. My name is Mark Smith by the way." He smiled, flashing impossibly white teeth, "I was saying that in today's day and age, with all this technology and complication, it's darn near impossible to keep track of the stuff. I myself have four credit cards, and I never know when I'm usin one too much, and the other too little. It hurts your credit score, you see, and you never know when you could be on the bad side of town and your cards are maxed out."

*Using the insecurity ploy on an old lady*, I thought, *Typical move. Standard, but not very creative.*

"With my memory I never could seem to know," I said, adding another cookie to his plate. The boy was just too thin. "Just the other day I ran out of money on my visa. I bought one too many hats for Mr. Scruffles."  Mr. Scruffles purred. He had liked the hats. 

"Exactly!" Exclaimed Mark, "but what if you could combine all your cards into one? I myself have four, I can't even remember their names, but now that they're on Unicard I never have to!  It's all on one card, all your money, and it's darn convenient."  He slapped a silver card on the table, pushing it my way, and I had to surpress a chuckle. 

The bastard hadn't even changed te card. It'd been twenty years sine I had made it but there it was, freshly polished, made by my own hands. 

The con was a simple one. Enter the target's house, and offer them a way to combine cards- for security for elderly targets, for impossibly higher reward for middle aged, and for higher credit caps for the young. Obtain all their credit information, then send it off to a shady company in china that would charge their cards for as much as they could through local channels, and send you 50%. You'd disappear, move to the next town, and wait for the checks to start rolling in. 

I would know, I'd come up with it, and now he was trying to use it against me. Cheeky bastard. 

Sighing, I let a small tear fall from my eye. 

"Ever since John has passed, it's been so hard handling the finances."  I sniffled, "But this should make it better. Here, oh look, here's my last picture of him. And there's my grandson and grand daughter."

I held out my wallet, flipping through my entire collection of pictures slowly, watching impatience flicker across his face. 

"Surely a man so handsome as you must have a pretty wife. Do you have any pictures of your own?"

"Why yes," he said, his face brightening. Never miss a chance to connect with a target. "Here." He slid his open wallet across the table, and at that moment I screamed. 

"Mr. Scruffles! You let him out! You left the door open!  Quick, get him!"

Mark lept up, running to the front door, and returned a moment later. His wallet was just where he had left it. 

"Miss, your door is closed, and your cat is under the table."

"Oh it must be my memory. I get so worked up when it comes to Mr. Scruffles."  

"Well I'm happy everything is ok. Are you ready to join?"  He pushed an iPad towards me on the table. Electronic cons? God it was so much easier for them. 

I entered in the information requested, then hit the big send button at the bottom. 

"Done!  So I'll have the card in two weeks?"

"Best give it three." He said, straightening his tie, and heading toward the door. But he had made one mistake. 

Never leave your wallet unattended. I had lied about my memory- it was quite good, even though my con days were over. Nearly photographic. 

Definitely strong enough to memorize his credit card numbers, name, and address, and enter them into the iPad instead of my own. 

By now, some shady company in China would be running those numbers, and sending him back 50 %.

#### [WP] An excerpt from the most cliché young adult novel

Score: 1762

 "You are not like them", Gary said. "You are different."

"I am?" I asked, confused. Around Gary, I was always confused.

"Yes, Belle, you are."

I shook my head. "I'm just a regular girl, confused and a bit dissatisfied with the world I live in, like every girl my age. I got this slight feeling that I'm special, sure, but so does every other teenager. Really, I'm normal as they come."

"Exactly."

"I mean, I'd wear Morrissey shirts, if The Smiths existed in our fictional world."

Gary nodded again. "Yes. You are normal and bland. Boring, even. A perfect blank slate. Something every single reader can identify with and think *'I am special, for I am just like the special protagonist'*."

"But if everyone thinks they are special, doesn't that defeat the very purp –"

"Just go with it, Belle. Don't question these things."

I sighed, tired. "Fine. What do I have to do?"

"Something absolutely awful and horrendous that no humane society would ever in a million years make people do just for the sake of adventure. It's going to be a death match with other teenagers."

"Fuck. Really?"

"Don't say fuck. Can't say fuck in a YA."

"Sorry. Crap. Really?"

"Hey, it was either this or going through the Triwizard Tournament just for the sake of you touching a trophy that's going to transport you to a cemetery, when the person who turned the trophy into a portkey could just as well have 
turned any other object around you to a portkey during the whole school year at Hogwarts and saved about 500 pages of what's arguably the weakest installment of the Potter series."

"You know, there's not one part of this sentence I don't need explained."

"Just forget it. Go get ready for the death match."

I nodded. It's silly, I know, but all of a sudden, I was worried. "Gary… Wait…"

"What?"

"What if I die?"

And Gary rolled his eyes at me. "You're not going to die, Belle. You're the main character."

"Are you sure?"

"Oh, it's going to look like you are gonna die, a bunch of times. You might even actually die, but then you'll do 
some voodoo crap and just go back to life with no good explanation at all. Man, I'm angry at Rowling today."

"What?"

"Relax. You're not going to die. If anything, you'll probably even live longer in the movies, since they're likely to do two films out of the last book no matter how unnecessary that sounds."

Gary, he had a way of calming me with his soft, confident tone and his reassuring smile. Even when he talked nonsense, like he was now. Again, I nodded. "Thanks, Gary."

"Now go get ready to do stuff that has been done better a thousand times before  so we can take money off of 
gullible people."

We hugged, and I turned back to leave. Suddenly, though, a thought crossed my mind.

"Hey, Gary…" I said, turning back to him.

"Yeah?"

"You know how I date Mike, and he's all strong and tanned and nice to me?"

"Yeah…"

"And how you are thin and pale, but cute in a rebel kind of way, and you treat me like shit in a charming manner?"

"Sure…"

I took another step towards him, feeling my cheeks blush. "Well... what if we start having feelings for each other? And weird PG-13 sexual tension moments between us? And then maybe Mike finds out, and stuff even gets a bit homoerotic between the two of you? What if all that happens?"

Gary took a deep breath. He rubbed his eyes with his hand, then pulled long, blonde locks of hair away from his 
face. His emerald blue eyes pierced me like a bad metaphor.

"Damn. Robert Pattinson is playing me in the movie, isn't he?" He asked, in a tired voice.

"Probably", I answered.

And then we made out and subtextually fucked like rabbits.

Edit: I went to sleep with the thought that if I'm lucky I might be able get one or two hundred upvotes. Never did I expect this. Thank you so much for the response. There are a few things that should probably be addressed here:

First - Art is a wonderful medium wherein once a creator has made something and shared it with the world at large, it no longer belongs just to him. Symbols and inferences that the author did not intend to exist can be found and introduce a depth and richness to a story beyond that which he had hoped. In a way, the writer and reader become co-creators in this work, each adding their own unique experiences to the mix. In regards to the gender/sex issue, I suppose the above applies here as well. However, if you really must know, I did imagine the Chemistry and History teachers as male and the Art teacher as female.

Second - I would like to give a shout-out to Mrs. Sealion, as we were scrolling through /r/writingprompts together and she wanted to read the stories on this particular prompt. When there were no stories yet, we got to write our own together. Basically what I'm saying is, now I know I need her to help me be successful.

Looking out the window at the people and the costumes, Harry was thinking that, eventually, he'd have to decide if he either hated or loved Halloween. It was a tough call.

"That's your costume?" Jeremy asked, coming out from the bedroom, and Harry turned and shook his head.

"No costume", he said.

"Come with us", Nina pleaded, coming out after Jeremy all dressed in princess.

"I'm ok", Harry answered, smiling. He finished the cigarette, then started making way past the couple to his bedroom.

"You have to get over it, you know", Jeremy said, in a low voice. "Every year, we come here to try and celebrate 
Halloween with you."

Jeremy was a pirate. Every year. He loved the fact that there was actually a boat waiting for him at the docks, 
every October 31st. If only for a day, he actually got to lead a crew of drunken pirates, like he always dreamed as a kid.

"And every year you bail at the last second, and spend it alone in this house", Nina completed.

"I'm all right guys", Harry said. "You go and have fun."

"You can be anything you want, man", Jeremy said. "Try it. You'll like it, I promise you."

"Really. You go. I'll just make some tea, or something."

"Harry, she's gone", Nina said, looking down at the floor. "Lisa's gone."

"Nina, I –"

"And I know it wasn't your fault, and I know it happened on Halloween, but Harry, it was five years ago. You have to get over it."

Harry smiled. "You guys go and have fun", he said. "I'm really ok."

"Are you sure?"

Harry nodded. He looked down, then up at the couple. "Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure."

Jeremy hugged him, and so did Nina.

By the front door, Jeremy asked, "Sure you're gonna be ok?"

"Hell yeah, I got Netflix", Harry said, forcing a smile.

"All right. Take care."

And then they were gone.

Harry closed the front door and made way down the corridor, past the living room into his bedroom.

He sighed, staring blankly at the king size bed much too big for him in between the nightstands.

Slowly, he made way to the closet and opened the door. He took the mustard-stained, ripped yellow shirt he used 
to sleep in so many years before from the top drawer and looked at it.

He unbuttoned the shirt he was wearing and took it off, laying it carefully on the bed. With a sigh, he put the yellow shirt on.

A second later, the bedroom door opened, like it had five years in a row now, every last day of October.

"Hey there", Lisa said, with the same smile she used every time.

Harry smiled, too. "Hey."

Lisa made way to him and took his hand. "I can't believe I let you sleep next to me in that old, stinky thing", she said, looking down at his shirt.

Harry chuckled. "It's my Lisa's Boyfriend costume", he said. "You know that."

"And it's the cheapest costume anyone ever wore on Halloween. It's just a shirt."

"It's the shirt I used to sleep in, before you..." Harry said, choking on the words before he could finish the sentence.

Lisa ran her hand down his cheek, wiping the tears. "It's ok, Harry."

"No it's not", Harry said, now between sobs. "Of course it's not. You're dead."

"Not tonight, I'm not", Lisa replied, pulling him closer. "Tonight I'm here."

Harry tried for a smile, but failed. For a while, neither of them said anything.

"I missed yo –"

"Shh", Lisa interrupted, placing her finger carefully on his lips. "Miss me tomorrow."

Harry lowered his eyes and his forehead touched Lisa's. Somewhere out the window, someone yelled, *"I'm flying! I 
loved this motherfucking Peter Pan outfit!*"

"I loved you so much, Lisa", Harry sobbed, quietly. "So much."

And Harry felt Lisa's hand run down his hair, and felt her breath on his neck and he thought that, eventually, he'd 
have to decide if he either hated or loved Halloween. It was a tough call.

#### [WP] Every day someone spends not speaking makes their words stronger; this means that more people will believe them even if they don't make sense, or do as they command without question. One woman made a vow of silence 20 years ago which she plans to break today.

Score: 1750

The announcer's booming voice filled the air, overtaking even the thunderous roar of the packed stadium.

"Please rise for the singing of our national anthem."

Today was finally the day. Libra Abbott had spent the last 20 years completely mute in preparation for tonight.

It was hard to get a ticket to the Superbowl, let alone sneak her way onto the sidelines. Luckily she was small and unobtrusive, especially surrounded by the throngs of coaches, staff, and the giant padded American football players.

She disguised herself as a reporter, with press badge and mic and all. Underneath, she wore an extra sweater and leggings. Security *might* not tackle her, after all, she was quite petite. But just in case they did she hoped that she would be slightly protected with the extra padding.

She had saved the power of her words for over two decades just for tonight. 

It would be the most-watched television event in history of the United States.

What she was about to say would be an inexorable compulsion for the huge crowd and the hundred and twenty million watchers at home.

Timing was key, and she only had one optimal chance to make it happen.

*O'er the land of the freeee and the home of the braveee~*

A second before the singer finished belting out the final line of the Star Spangled Banner, Libra started her sprint to the stand and wrestled the microphone away from the famous, and now indignant, singer-celebrity. 

In the corner of her eye she glimpsed the burly security staff realizing what she was doing and just barely beginning to react.

She only had a couple seconds before security would reach her.

She gripped the microphone tightly, squeezed her eyes shut, and screamed at the top of her lungs.

Score: 1729

"This Lady Psycho is a piece of work", Eric grunted, from the couch. "Hope she's gone for good, this time."

Ellie made way to the living room, wrapping the ice in a towel as she walked. "Here." She pressed the cold wrap on Eric's forehead. "This will help with the swelling."

"I mean, it's ridiculous. Every week he defeats her, and every week she comes up with some new plan."

"What do you care what Lady Psycho and Power Dude are up to?" Ellie asked, looking from Eric to the TV. 
Onscreen, superhero and supervillain were exchanging punches and kicks across Garden Boulevard on cell phone camera footage.

"I don't", Eric said, glancing at Ellie. " I don't, I'm just saying… every week it's the same. Why doesn't she give up?"	

"Maybe she's got a plan", Ellie ventured, careful. "Maybe she's doing all this for a reason. How did you hurt
yourself, again?"

"I tripped", Eric said. "What reason? The city's a freaking utopia. Well, was, until she showed up."

It was true. Power Dude had eradicated crime in the whole city.

Not *virtually* eradicated. Literally. There were no more crimes at all in Ventura Town. That is, until Lady Psycho showed up.

"She's got something against him, I'm sure. All these gas stations and convenience stores she robs, always 
lingering, waiting for me to – I mean for him to show up. It's like she wants to get caught. She's obsessed with m 
– him. "

"Maybe", Ellie replied, pressing the towel a little harder against the bruise on Eric's forehead. "Try to relax. How are 
you feeling?"

"It still hurts a little, but –"

"No, I mean… you know. The other thing."

"Oh", Eric glanced at Ellie, then at the floor. "Better, I think. Dr. Smith says I can reduce the dosage to half, and 
see how I feel from there. And I've been feeling better, lately, like, in general."

"That's good to know", Ellie smiled. Onscreen Lady Psycho was diving fist first towards Power Dude. They collided 
and stumbled to the floor.

"Well, I'm going to go take a shower", Eric said. "Thanks for the ice. How'd *you* hurt yourself, by the way?"

Startled, Ellie pulled her shirt collar up. "It's just a hickey."

Eric chuckled, disappearing inside his room. Ellie sighed.

She didn't like robbing places, and she always made a point of returning everything she took in the dead of the 
night, when no one was watching. And she never hurt any bystanders.

A supervillain life didn't suit her at all, but something had to be done. For Eric's sake. First Jasmine breaking up with him, then the whole utopia he created…

He was his own downfall. No wonder the drinks and the depression kicked in.

A city without crimes is great for the people and all, but what's the city's hero supposed to do with his days?

Ellie considered telling him she knew about Power Dude. Maybe if he had someone to talk about, things would get better. Maybe he just needed to vent. A friend.

But then she had a better idea.

Lady Psycho gave Eric's life meaning again. Gave him a reason to get over Jasmine, quit the booze and put the 
Power Dude suit on again. Lady Psycho got him to start seeing a therapist and got his appetite back. If that meant 
a few bruises here and there and having to escape the police, so be it.

If it meant dressing in a ridiculous costume and learning martial arts, fine. At least Eric was smiling again.

"Wait a minute", Eric's voice came, followed by his face on the crack of the door. "A hickey? Are you seeing 
someone?"

"What? Oh, no", Ellie answered, in a hushed tone. "No one special."

"Eeellie, come on", Eric insisted. "Are you in love?"

Ellie sighed, forcing herself to smile. 

She just wanted Eric to be happy. If that meant having to lie to him, so be it.

"No, really", she said. "I'm not."

#### [WP] All humans go automatically to hell when they die. You can gain access to a heaven though, but only if the animals you interacted with while living vouch for you.

Score: 1722

I’m not an animal person. I swear that every single cat that I’ve ever crossed paths with has plotted my murder; the circumstances of my premature death leave open the possibility that one of them succeeded… stainless steel food bowls don’t push themselves off of 5th floor balconies. So when I entered the Eternal Judgment Court room, and saw a smug looking Sphynx eyeing me with hate-filled eyes, I knew I was fucked.
Countless “witnesses” were called, all of them silver tongued felines with nothing but disparaging accounts against my character; they recounted slights I committed against animal kind, that I didn’t even remember or believe were true.

“I once saw the defendant kick a pigeon.”

*Complete bullshit*

“The defendant has been known to attempt to run various cats over with his vehicle.”

*Another false allegation*

“The defendant once tortured a naive kitten for hours with The Red Dot!”

*OK, that one is true*

Even the more friendly dogs had little to say about me, and what good they tried to add on my account was brushed aside by the Sphynx as “most likely embellished flattery”. But at least they tried to stick up for me. Every type of animal I had ever interacted with in my entire life was called to testify, and after days it seemed that nothing would be said to grant me eternal happiness. I was to be damned for all eternity by the very breed of despicable little creatures that ended my time on earth.

The Sphinx raised his gavel, “If no other animal has any testimony to proffer on behalf of this human then by my rights as Supreme Judge of Animal Kind I hereby…”
“Wait!” A low and small voice says, from the floor behind be.
I turn around to see a small turtle pushing his way through the large courtroom doors.
“Wait… I have… something to say.” The turtle pants as he crawls forward, finally free of the doors. “I was sunbathing on a log one day, when some mean kids came and picked me up and started tossing me around,” 

*Oh great, am I supposed to have been one of these little hooligans?*

“One dropped me, and I landed on my back. I was helpless, and they just laughed. But this human, he came over and yelled at the other kids until they went away. Then he picked me up, and carried me back to my log and set me back down in the sun.”

I was stunned; until now I had completely forgotten about that day. I was six, maybe seven, and I had been at the lake with my family. Who knows where my parents were, they weren’t the most attentive parents in the world. But I had seen a group other kids tossing what I thought was a ball, and wanting to join in the fun had run over to them. When I got closer I saw that it wasn’t a ball they were tossing, but a turtle, and for some reason this enraged me and I flew into a fury, yelling and throwing sand at the other kids to “stop teasing the poor turtle.”
I looked at the small creature by my foot, tears beginning to well up in my eyes. “Thank you” I mouthed, too emotional to actually get the words out. The turtle just gave a small slow dip of his head.

“In light of this new testimony, the Eternal Judgement Court does so recognize that this human once offered vital assistance to a fellow animal, at potential risk to his own person.” My heart was lifting with every word. “However this one action does not erase a lifetime of malice towards other animal. The defendant is hereby sentenced to a lifetime of damnation.”

*Shit, fucking cats.*

#### [EU] It's the year 3000. Bruce Wayne's family line has continued strong, a member of each generation always bearing the mantle of the Bat. Constant training and seeking of only strong mates have bred the Waynes into super humans.

Score: 1722

Alexander walked through the gallery of The Bat. Generations of his family were portrayed as the Dark Knight of their time. Dressed in full armour and the cowl under their arm. Some had their respective Robin standing besides them. He stopped at the last portrait in the gallery. It portrayed the first Batman.

Alexander was looking the painting of Bruce Wayne in the eyes. That was quite the feat, considering the painting was over two and a half meters off the ground. The man in the picture was small compared to the latest Master of Wayne manor.

"Hello Bruce." Alexander whispered, looking into the grey eyes. Generations of Batmen had protected Gotham, Earth and the Solar System from the all evils that could be brought to bear. But it was still Bruce Wayne that was revered amongst his successors, and Alexander was his greatest fan.

"It's finally time." he continued, "The elders called me into the chamber last night. They initiated me into the order of the Bat. I'm the new Batman." Alexander looked around the gallery, checking he was alone before continuing. "I'm scared. I'm not nearly as strong as father, nor as fast as grandfather. I'm the first Batman in six generations who isn't physically better than the one before him." 

His gaze had drifted down from the portrait to the ground. "But I am smarter than my dad. I've done better at school than him, I even have a doctorate. But that can't be enough to be Batman"

A cough was heard at the beginning of the hall. Alexander turned his gaze, worried that someone caught his confession, his fears. The sound originated from a slight man, long, thin and dressed in a fine black suit with white shirt. "Master Alexander." the man said in a crisp English accent. 
"Alfred..." Alexander answered softly, embarrassed and worried.

"I heard what you said there, Master Alexander." Alfred continued, stepping towards the young man.
"You're not going to tell father, are you?" Alexander asked worried. In the past, these confessions of weakness were not welcome in the Wayne family.

The butler smiled friendly and put his hand reassuringly on Alexander's shoulder. "Of course not, Master Alexander. Truth be told, I've heard these same worries from many of your ancestors over the years." Alfred gestured through the gallery of portraits. 

"Your father was the strongest Batman Gotham ha ever seen, but he was brutal and unforgiving, like his father before him. But your great-grandfather, Derik Wayne, was not near as harsh. Every Wayne has lent their own ideas to the mantle of the Bat. But you remind me of the first Dark Knight."

Alfred smiled as he thought back. "Master Bruce was probably the smartest Batman we've had, though Masters Dick and Damian were not not far behind him. He was the master strategist for the Justice League and one of its chief scientists and detectives." His eyes looked up to find Alexander's. "And that, Master Alexander, is where I think you can shine as well. You will do great..."

Alfred's body disappeared as the AI with the butler's memories shut itself off, knowing it gave the encouragements that were needed. He had done so for generations.

#### [WP]: it's the year 2057. Queen Elizabeth still reigns. People are getting suspicious.

Score: 1720

Elizabeth 2.0 arched an eyebrow as the assassin’s weapon pierced the soft synthetic tissue of her chest. Her attacker recoiled at her apparent indifference, leaving the large wooden stake embedded in her body, right where her heart would have been. Her dress was ruined.

“A vampire?” She held the stake between her thumb and forefinger and plucked it free. “Really?” 

There was a tingling sensation in her chest as swarms of nanites rushed to repair the damage that her assailant had caused. They wouldn’t be able to fix her dress, though. She took a step forward.

“Back, foul creature!” The assassin stepped backwards, almost tripping over his robes in his haste. He had disguised himself as an Anglican Bishop – or perhaps he was an Anglican Bishop. They had made no secret of the fact that they thought her surprising longevity suspicious. Elizabeth tried to search for the man’s face in the state database, but the wifi signal in the palace was abysmal. 

The bishop and/or assassin was now brandishing a silver cross and mumbling something in Latin. 

“Who sent you?” Her universal translator had defaulted to Latin also, which only seemed to confirm the man’s suspicions that she was some sort of demon. 

“Was it George? We do find his little rebellion amusing, though if this is the best he can throw at us we are afraid his uprising will be as short as his grandfather’s.”

The silver cross hurtled through the air, slicing through the paper-thin flesh above her left eye and exposing part of the chrome endoskeleton beneath. She sighed in frustration. 

“As though you haven’t been rude enough already.” She stepped forward again, her fingers slowly forming into long, razor-sharp claws as the nanites shaped and reshaped her flesh. 

“I am the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,” she took another step forward, he took another step back. 

“I am Empress of Europe, Czarina of Russia and the Queen of Mars.” She drew her hand back, preparing to deliver the killing blow. She hadn’t had to shed blood personally since the revolution of 2022. Good times.

“And you…” she concluded, flexing her claws in anticipation. “Who do you think you are, to challenge me?”

“I…am a distraction,” said the man. “Now!”

Elizabeth felt a hand on the back of her neck, lifting her hair, accessing the hidden USB port that was only ever to be used in case of emergency. She had just enough time to wonder how they had found the plans, the original blueprints that revealed her one weakness, before she felt the virus take hold. 

As her consciousness fragmented and dissolved, Elizabeth 2.0 fell to her knees. She lost control of her nanites, and they began to wreak havoc, roaming unfettered throughout her systems as her body cannibalized itself.

#### Magic is Hereditary, but the child's powers is the sum of his parents. Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [WP]

Score: 1712

"Here is your first assignment," the taskmaster said to me, handing over a small sealed scroll.

I took it eagerly, opening it without hesitation.

> Locate a Pure within the city limits

I looked back up to the taskmaster.  "Is this a joke?"

He shook his head.  "No joke, initiate."  His mind betrayed no hint of deception, but of course someone like him could weave a story out of whole cloth without revealing himself.  He wouldn't have the job, otherwise.

"I don't understand."  I said, making sure my confusion was perceptible to him.  "There hasn't been a Pure in over a hundred years."

The taskmaster nodded.  "There hasn't been a *publicly acknowledged* Pure in over a hundred years.  Think back to what happened to that last one and you'll probably figure out why."

The taskmaster didn't have to remind me - the last Pure had been kidnapped by every organization that had even the barest means to do so.  Sometimes he'd even been kidnapped from other kidnappers.  He hadn't lived an enjoyable life, and at some point he realized he never would.  They found him asphyxiated, presumably via his own air magic.

"There are," the taskmaster interrupted my thoughts, "at least three Pure within the city limits.  Find one of them."

I nodded, used a bit of fire magic to dispose of the scroll containing my instructions, and left the building to roam the streets of the city.

Once I got over my initial shock that there was a Pure in the city (let alone three of them), it made sense.  Their magic wouldn't stand out, so long as they could manage to tone it down to the level that the common person could use.  The whiff of flame I'd disposed of the scroll with was about as much fire as anyone could conjure, for example.  A gust of wind to clean up dust or (maybe) close a door.  A handful of water to stave off thirst, though as any desert traveler could tell you that was very much a zero-sum proposition.  Furrowing the earth to plant a few seeds.  Knowing the surface thoughts of your fellow man.  Such were the powers everyone had access to.  Like any skill, they could be honed, but the days of mighty wizards destroying entire cities with a rain of fire were long gone.

Or so I'd thought.  Because if the Pure were here, it was within their power.  I didn't understand exactly how - I left genetics to the monks - but every once in a while someone was born who didn't inherit their meager powers from their meager parents.  Generations of breeding had dulled the once terrifying abilities of the mages of long ago, but the Pure were proof that they had in fact been our forefathers.  They commanded a single element directly, and with a power that none could match.  Of course, any time one went public they were kidnapped and - at best - used for breeding stock.  Unless they were willing to level an entire block to deal with potential captors, it only made sense to stay hidden.

I didn't worry that I was exposing an innocent person's secret to the taskmaster - the fact that they knew of three Pure in the city already told me that such persons were watched, but not interfered with.  One would think the organization would want such a person for the same reasons everyone else did, but that would ignore what the organization truly stood for:  The status quo.

It didn't matter, though.  I had my assignment.  Clearly it was a test - I could hardly be expected to locate a fourth Pure where others with years more experience had failed - but I took it seriously.  The question was, how would I find such people?  They wouldn't dare use the full extent of their abilities in public, or else everyone would know.

I smiled as the answer came to me.  All I had to do was make it very clear to anyone who looked at my mind that I was seeking a Pure.  Ordinary people would read my intent and get out of the way; all I had to do was find someone who didn't react (or who needed someone to tell them), and then I'd investigate those people later.  It wouldn't work if my target's element was Mind, of course, but a Pure Mind could make you forget they ever existed so trying to locate one was pointless.

Finding a Pure was easy, I reflected as I started my patrol.  It wasn't about what they could do.  It was about what they *couldn't*.

Leonardo DiCaprio made his way to the microphone, shaking his head. He looked a little manic in fact, as he let out a high-pitched sound of disbelief. The smile stretched across his face, but in an odd way, he didn't look very happy at all.

He crouched to put the Oscar on the floor. Then he stood up tall, leaning into the microphone. "I have two words for everyone tonight."

"Fuck," he said pausing to make a circle with his fist. He slipped his pointer finger into his fist, jerking it in and out, making what some might call a lewd gesture. "You."

He pointed at everyone in the audience, laughing for a moment, then conveying a mere micro-expression of pain. His face twisted and turned, as he conveyed the best moments from each of his roles. The romanticism of Jack Dawson, the profane tragedy of Billy, the unhinged twistedness of Calvin Candie. All the characters welled up within him, subsumed him.

The spirit of True Art rushed through him, his eyes turned a bright red. His laugh became deep, dark, inhuman. He picked up the Oscar statue, crushed it with his bare hands. He looked out among the audience and said, "Your accolades mean nothing."

Sitting at a table with other Oscar nominees, Kevin James shit himself.

From the front row, Hermione's hand shot into the air and waved back and forth. Harry and Ron rolled their eyes. The new teacher nodded in her direction.

"Sir, don't you mean 'Defense Against the Dark Arts?'"

He looked back down at the papers on his desk with a slackjawed expression 

"Oh, right. Well, good work Ms... ummm.... Granger. I guess I didn't read the letter from that bird very closely. Doesn't matter; at least I'm not working for Mother anymore." He reached into his ill-fitting robes, pulled out a flask, and chugged the contents. "So, anyway," he continued, "I'm your new teacher, Sterling Archer. And I am going to teach you self defense!" Hermione's hand shot into the air again, but he ignored it. "There's really only one thing you kids ever need to know about self defense: fucking guns!"

He reached into his other pocket this time, and pulled out a black, metal contraption. Harry, Hermoine, and the other muggle-born students scooted back and tried to hide under their desks, while Ron and the other Wizard-born students all leaned in for a better look.

Archer twirled the gun on his finger casually. 

"They told me a bit about this school when I first started, and they said that all of the other teachers who had this job had been killed or something. Which made it sound pretty cool. But then I learned that none of those bastards had been carrying! What the hell? No wonder they died."

He went around the room with a big box full of weapons. Uzis, pistols, a few grenades... each student picked one out, and he headed back up to the front of the classroom.

"I seriously can't believe that no one has ever gone over this with you kids. Like, five years of learning self defense and nobody ever mentioned carrying a gun? It's the *ultimate* self defense! So, next time some lizard-looking Moldy Wort asshole comes after you, you just shoot him in the face!"

He aimed the gun at a wall as if to demonstrate, and the gun went off with an ear-shattering crash. A little tendril of smoke curled from the barrel, and the shelf of potions across the room shattered; one of them appeared to be melting a hole through the floor down to the next level of dungeons.

"Haha, holy shit! Umm... also remember to keep the safety on."

He muttered under his breath "*if you're a pussy...*"

#### [WP] John can see 10 seconds in to the future. Barry can go back in time 10 seconds. They fight.

Score: 1699

When people heard that John and Barry were going to fight they expected some kind of battle of the gods. Their abilities were well known for everyone in the room, but not so well understood. Their incapability to perceive things outside of their present time made them see only a fraction of what happened.  

After just 1 second Barry was knocked down in the floor, trying to catch his breath and, some would say after, looking considerably older than just a moment ago. It was shocking seeing how his short, carefully combed hair, now a completely white mop of hair, dirty and wet from Barry's sweating was completely covering his face.  

Barry didn't look like he had won that fight, but then people realised that John was on the floor too, screaming, eyes wild open, holding his head and writhing his body as if he was having a seizure.  

Truth is that Barry tried hitting John first, John saw it and dodged it, hitting Barry in the face. Barry went back 10 esconds and tried again, with the same result. When Barry didn't gave up all his tries started building up on Johns mind.  

Barry went back a thousand times, exhausting and stressing him, and John saw one thousand tries in a fraction of a second, driving him mad.  
We could say that the only winner that day were those who had given them their powers for entertainment.

"Everyone shut up and watch!"  An old man commanded.  

I felt a bead of sweat run down my forehead.  Every eye in the building was trained on me.  With a final twist of my hand I removed the tomato can's lid and placed it on the counter.

"He didn't cut himself?"

"How did he not spill it?"

A chorus of questions erupted around me.  Hands slapped me on the back in congratulation.  They happily paraded me to my next task to see if I could accomplish it.  Pouring laundry detergent.  Thunderous applause again as I did not spill a single drop on my white shirt.  The people were becoming more and more fanatical with every passing second.  Women were throwing themselves at me, men wanted to be me.  I felt like a god.  Until I felt something hit me in the back of the skull.

"Billy Mays here.  You know why I have called this meeting."  Billy Mays shouted.

Billy May's shouting woke me up, and amplified my splitting headache.  I tried to move but my legs and arms were tied to a chair.  

"What? Where am I?"  I said groggily.

"Where you are doesn't matter.  What does matter is you. Ruining. EVERYTHING!"  Billy's fist slammed down onto the table spilling drinks.  The other people at the table cursed quietly and got up to get paper towels.  

"No you morons, the sham-wow.  Jesus."  Billy shouted.

"Now.  Where was I,"  he paused for a second, "that's right.  Torturing you."  He stood up and approached me with a nasty looking pair of pliers.

"I see you admiring my pliers.  Well this is a six in one multi-tool that can tear you so many new ones you couldn't believe it.  And only for four easy payments of nineteen ninety nine.  A steal really."  He backhanded me, my teeth felt loose and my head rang.

"Why are you doing this?"  I pleaded.

"Because if people realize they can do things without all this useless shit, we will be ruined!"  He back handed me again.  I spit out a bit of blood.  The straps holding me down felt like they were getting looser.  I shifted in my seat.  Sure enough the strap holding my chest and arms slid down a fraction of an inch.

Billy saw me struggling against my bindings and laughed.  "Those straps can hold down a rhino.  I know I used them during my last trophy hunt."  He said wickedly.

"Grab me the clean.  We're going to drown him in it."  One of the others grabbed a large white and blue bucket and walked it over.  White water sloshed over the side with every step he took.  Billy squeezed his eyes shut and pressed his hand to his forehead.  "I swear to god, look at what you are doing!  Now you have to clean it up!  Use the two in one mop vacuum.  Cuts down on cleaning time by fifty percent!"  

While Billy was distracted yelling at his incompetent help I had been getting out of my bindings.  The straps on my feet fell away as I stood up, and the one that was on my chest and arms had fallen low enough I could undo the clip with my hands.

The man walking the bucket over saw me first.  

"B-b-b-"  He tried to stammer out.  

I threw a strap around Billy's neck and pulled tight.  I kicked the back of his knees out and he fell.  His face growing more blue with every second.  The others in the room did nothing.  They watched in horror as Billy's eyes bulged and his body spasmed for the last time. 

I stood over the corpse staring them down.  As one they fell to their knees and prostrated themselves in front of me.  

"Please don't hurt us!"  They cried out.

"No.  I have a better idea."

The infomercial ran on every channel every day in between peoples favorite shows.

"Introducing JOHN!  Are you sick and tired of not having something to worship?  Your god not doing a good enough job answering prayers?  Well look no further than JOHN!  He can do anything!  The best part?  To become a member of the Church of John all you need to do is send in just one easy payment of nineteen ninety nine!"

#### [WP] Charon, boatman of the river Styx, gets the last two coins he needs for what he's been saving up for since the beginning of time.

Score: 1690

The boat hit the bank of Hades with a jolt.  The sudden stop almost forces the two passengers to be thrown from their seats and into the bottom of the boat, where foul, Stygian water sloshed about.  The boatman, skinny and bent over with untold age, held out his hand.  "Payment."

The passengers looked at each other, then at the gnarled hand in front of them.  One of them, an older man, bent forward and spat into the outstretched palm.  A worn obolus, shiny with saliva, landed in the hand.  The spitter looked at it with distaste and shook his head.  "You can have the damned thing.  I didn't want to keep it in my mouth much longer."

The boatman raised his hand and examined the coin.  He gave a satisfied nod, then disappeared the coin into the tattered cloak that he wore.  He then lowered his hand to the chin of the other passenger.  "Payment," he said again.

The boat rider, a younger man, shook his head and kept his mouth shut tight.

The boatman said, "Payment, or wander the shores of Hades for a hundred years."  He gestured at the riverbanks, where a thousand souls, damned by their inability to pay, shuffled by the stagnant water.  They moaned about their existence, about their plight to not leave the riverside, about their discontent with how their lives and, ultimately, their afterlives have turned out.  The keening was an unholy sound, loud and persistent, with the ability to bore into the skull of the dead young man.

He considered his possible future for a moment, a hundred years of wailing.  Then he turned, took the silver dollar from his mouth, and placed it into the boatman's hand.

After placing the coin into his cloak, the boatman said, "Finally."  He then helped the passengers out of the boat.

As the old man stepped onto shore, he asked, "Great Charon, why did you say 'finally' when you received that last coin?"

The boatman gestured at the throng of souls, trapped on the banks, with a wave of his hand.  "Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones," he said, then pushed off to head back to the other side of the Styx.

Sadly, the heroes are weak in comparison so the wizard creates a persona as a 'wise teacher' to train these heroes in order to defeat him.

Score: 1681

Rolf looked at me with worried eyes. 

"Do you think I can defeat him?"

"I've taught you everything I can, and as long as you remember to do everything that needs to be done" I replied as I stretched, rose, and kicked dirt over the embers of our fire, "I'm confident the dark wizard's rule over this land will end tonight. The most difficult part of our journey is already behind us, all we have left is to sneak into the castle and find and destroy his heart."

We'd made camp under an overhang of rock in the cliffs leading up to my castle, a blind spot for the guards in manning the towers. Now it was full-dark, with no moon to be seen in the sky and patches of clouds covering most of the stars. Time to enter the caves.

"It's just... Nostromo has ruled this land for close to 100 years. The idea that our freedom is so near is too good to believe. What if he knows about the tunnels?"

"Oh, he knows," I replied, "he simply believes that he's completely aware of who possesses said knowledge. The important thing is that *his guards* don't know about this entrance. He doesn't trust them that much."

My feet led me down the familiar path, through winding twists of stone that went from being barely wide enough for a man to large enough for a team of draft animals to comfortably stand side-by-side. My pulse quickened and a knot of tension began to grow in my stomach as we stealthily worked our way through what seemed an endless passage until we came to the stairs carved into the stone. 

The steps led us upward and into a tunnel carved into the living rock, which ended with a heavy wooden door. I made a show of working at the lock with my tools and opened our way into my home. 

"Say what you will about the guy," Rolf whispered as we made our way through the wine cellar, "the guy knows how to party. I think a thorough celebratory drink is going to be in order once we've defeated this wizard, eh, Omor?" 

"There is nothing more refreshing than wine after a hard fought victory," I agreed, "but let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's going to take me all of my concentration to weaken the magical bonds surrounding the power-matrix. Once I have, though, you'll need to focus completely on destroying it. Focus your energies and swing that blade true, this is the purpose for which it was forged. Drive it all the way through his heart and the land will be free once more." 

"I've got it, I won't let you down." 

We made our way through a number of dark, deserted corridors before finally reaching the chamber deep in the heart of the dungeon that housed the heart of my magic. 

Immortality had seemed like such a wonderful fancy all those years ago. The sheen wore off far more quickly than I ever imagined. I'm tired, so very tired, and the protections I put in place to guard against my enemies proved to be too much for myself to handle alone when the unending passage of time morphed from blessing to bane. 

As we neared the correct chamber the walls seemed to come alive with a low menacing hum and the air filled with a tense energy. The hairs on our arms and necks began to stand on end. 

Reaching the correct chamber I opened the door, revealing a large, circular room 20 feet across with a small oak pedestal upon which sat a small walnut box. A series of crude runes were carved into the wall opposite the door. 

"Ready yourself, Rolf," I said as I walked past the pedestal towards the runes. "When I tell you, drive your blade through that box with all your might. That's his heart in there, and once it's been driven through the spell will be broken and death will quickly find our magical friend." 

I placed my right hand against the runes and turned to watch my student ready himself. When I saw he was prepared I began slowly speaking the old words in a tongue that hadn't been heard since times of legend. The runes in the wall began to glow a warm, sickly green as a chill overtook the air. 

"Rolf! Now!" 

I watched the blade drive through the box, pinning it to the table at the same instant a bolt of white hot pain drove through my chest and blood began to soak my robes. Rolf was intent upon his mission and lost himself in a frenzy of swings.

"Peace... at last, peace," I thought as I sat on the stones with my back to the wall as I felt the life drain from my body. My vision graying, I pulled the small parchment I'd concealed from my robes and held it in my hands. An explanation for the man who'd helped me so much. 


Rolf paused and turned, sensing something amiss. He saw the body of his mentor in a pool of blood and rushed to his side with a cry, but too late, the body was completely still with a rolled piece of parchment clutched in his fist. He saw his name written on the outside, pried the note from the stiffening fingers and began to read. 

>Rolf, I leave you my castle and lands to do with as you see fit. Thank you for helping me to finally rest. 

>Omor T'Son (Nostromo)

Score: 1673

I set my stopwatch for 15 minutes- that's how long I was told to wait in the time chamber. Apparently, relativity means that my watch will still progress 15 minutes as they would normally in the real world.

I waved goodbye to the team, smiling with glee at the prospect of being the world's first human time traveler.

The door shut and a loud, low hum stuffed into my ears. It was somewhere inbetween soothing and painful. I started my stopwatch, and closed my eyes. *This is it.*

When the timer rang, I immediately sprang up and opened the door with fervor and excitement, bursting with joy...but that joy quickly vacated me, as everyone else had the building.

I was sent 24 hours in the future, but it seems that was enough time for a horror story to unfold. The lab was trashed, chairs and computers strewn across the room in a sea of broken glass and messy cables. There were bodies scattered across the room, broken and bloodied. It was...silent.

I looked to the left and saw writing on the wall, streaks trailing below each letter. "Sorry", it read, written in blood. The blood of my friends and coworkers. There was something else under it, written in smaller text.

"Sorry we made you cry like a bitch."

The lights flipped on and Johnny Knoxville popped out from under a desk, kicking me in the balls and shouting with his fists in the air.

"I'm Johnny Knoxville, and this is Punk'd for people that aren't pussies. Fuck you Ashton Kutcher!" he shouted at a hidden camera.

I clutched my abdomen, kneeled over, with tears streaming down my face. "I don't understand," I groaned.

"You didn't go into the future, ya dumbass. We just sat you in a metal tube, played a loud-ass humming noise and then fucked everything up to scare the piss outta you."

I couldn't tell if I was crying because of my testicles or my dreams- both had been crushed.

He was feelin' a little down

After fiddlin' a bunch, he was havin' a hunch

He'd lost the right to his crown



*In the Emerald City,* he thought,

*there are no southerners or jews.*

*There may be a chance to change my stance*

*Try an instrument I can't lose.*



He wandered 'round Pike's Market 

Till he found a promising lad

He was rockin' hard, this modern bard, 

So he said "Let's talk a tad."



"Now you've drawn a pretty good crowd here, son, 

But you've still got a lot to learn.

I'll bet a mountain of gold against your soul

That I can make your ear-balls churn."



The lad said "Well my name's Chang, 

And maybe it's a sin,

But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret

Cause I really think I'll win!"



Devil raise your weapon high and put Chang in the pit.

Cause you suck at playing fiddle more than just a little bit.

You'll give up a whole peak of gold if this dude is not a troll.

But if he is, then you will score his soul.



Chang stretched his fingers wide and said "I'm not one to tease."

And honey flowed across the crowd as his fingers crossed the keys.

It was a haunting melody and it brought the crowd to its feet

Then he began a rocking solo while screaming "Let's bring up the heat!!"

*Awesome music solo*



The Devil smiled politely when Chang was winding down.

"Not bad," he said, "But before you bow, first check this shit out."

Old Scratch strapped in, yelled "SHALL WE BEGIN?!"

And he played his title bout.

 

Fire on the Mountain, give up now.

Chang's in the house of the aroused sow.

Chicken in the bed pan picking out poo.

Granny do you hog-tie, yes I do.



Chang's face went ashen cause he knew that he had lost.

And he bowed his head as the Devil took Chang's soul for his cost.

And the Devil said "Don't feel too bad, you may have been a star. 

But you should have known the Devil's own, I created the fucking keytar!

*Edit* Wow guys, that is a whole lot of love to wake up to! Glad you all enjoyed it.

"I see," he said.

"And it was asking me ten or twelve times a day if I wanted to update Java. The stupid thing just would not shut up about Java. Or Adobe Flush, whatever that is."

So. Another smartass has asked for the "express lane" treatment, shortening a 25-year life sentence down to a single day. Goddamn it, I hate doing this to another person. 

I pause, and shake my head. No, "person" isn't the right term for a monster like this. I leaf through his record, wincing at the goriest of the details. The pages flip by, and some helpful soul inserted before-and-after pictures of the victims. Those poor children. I steel myself for the job at hand, now convinced that I'm doing the right thing.  The last set of photos, the ones with the twin sisters and their beautiful smiles... 

I leave my office, headed to the maximum security wing where we've brought the monster in. The haunting eyes of those kids follow me through the halls, causing me to clench my hands into fists. Remorse has given way to anger, which is giving way to hatred. An awful smile creeps onto my face. The bastard deserves what we're going to do to him. 

I reach the cell where we've got this animal locked up. An assistant stands near the door controls for this cell. The massive door resembles an old-style bank vault, with some pleasingly thick bolts and tight seals. These doors close so tightly that not even a peep of sound or breath of air gets in or out without our consent. The view-port opens like a porthole on an old ship, and the intercom box looks like the one on my old apartment, save for the armoured housing it rests in. I key the microphone, and the filthy creature inside looks up with a twisted grin. 

"Prisoner 53158, can you hear me?"

The creature's horrible eyes lock onto the small circle of glass I'm looking through.

"Yeah, I hear you."

"Due to severe prison overcrowding, we are prepared to offer you an expedited sentence at the cost of reducing your quality of life for the duration of the sentence. The minimum time you can serve is one day -"

"Gimme a day, Warden. I can take anything you can dish out, and I'll see you tomorrow."

I hate the smile that's oozed its way onto his face. Smug piece of shit thinks he can take it, and be right back out there tomorrow. My fists unclench, and my voice calms. 

"I am legally required to inform you that no prisoner has successfully made it through the twenty-four hour treatment with all their mental faculties intact. Do you still agree to the minimum sentence?"

He starts to laugh.

"If I was all there in the head, would I be in this cell?  *Bring it on, I'll be a* ***FREE MAN TOMORROW!***"

"Your consent has been acknowledged and recorded for our records."

I turn to the assistant who's been standing by, waiting for my word. I carefully neglect to release the push-to-talk button on the intercom.

"Release the gas."

From the corner of my eye, I can see a note of fear creep onto the prisoner's face. His cell is secure enough, if a bit spartan. What he hadn't noticed was the gas nozzles hidden in the vent above. 

Some brilliant scientist had discovered the chemical a few years back. With a forty-eight syllable name, I'd never heard it pronounced by its full name, but it had a street name: Timeout. Something in its hideous chemical structure radically alters the brain's perception of time. It'd had a brief heyday as a luxury drug among the intellectual and artistic types to 'get some thinking done' before it was outlawed and put to this use. Blending it with some clever stimulants means the subject will not tire or sleep. 

His cell appears comfortable, if a little bare. Three bare concrete walls, and a heavy steel door. A clock mounted in a heavy cage provides little in the way of distraction. 

To us, a day. 

To him, a lifetime.

"All right, the alien says now, looking at me. "All right."

I don't know how to explain what's happening to the president. But I gotta say something. The aliens told me to make the call, and they told me to tell my leader about them, so I got to. But I don't know how.

The aliens... They are... *different.*

"Mr. President", I finally say to the phone. "I -- uh... I got the alien here, yes. Yes, yes, I'm on the ship now. 
What? No. I don't know how they got your number. Is this really important right now?"

"They, sir. Not just 'he'. They all look and act exactly like Matthew McConaughey." I nudge at the alien, signaling 
the phone and extending the speaker his way. "Isn't that right?"

The alien takes another drag, then he nods his head. "All riiiight."

"See?" I say, back on the phone again.

"Huh", the president says. "Huh... Huh... Huh... This is very odd."

"I thought so too, Mr. President."

"Are you sure you are not just too sleepy to come up with a decent prompt response?"

"No, sir. They really do look like Matthew McConaughey."

The president hesitates. Then, "I'm going to have to call you back, ok?"

"Ok."

I hang up. The alien now has his eyes closed, and is listening to Tchaikovsky and conducting an imaginary orchestra with his fingers.

"Huh... Mr. Alien?" I venture.

He opens his eyes and stares at me.

"I... Uh... That was the president. He's... He's going to call back", I say. 

The alien doesn't say anything. A second Matthew McConaughey alien passes by us, carrying some papers and heading for the control room.

"Huh... The thing is... We... Well, you all sort of kind of look like a person. Back on Earth. A celebrity human."

"All right..." Matthew says, a tone of suspicion in his voice.

"And we... Well, we found that to be a little odd. Don't you?"

He nods in agreement. "All right", he says. He gets up and he puts his hand on my shoulder. "All right", he says, in a tranquilizing tone.

I wait, but there is no more. This is all he's got to say. 

Another two Matthew McConaugheys pass by us, and they stop by the main one's side.

"All right?" One of them asks. 

"All right, all right, all right", Mathew answers, hand still on my shoulder. "All right", he completes.

The phone rings again. I answer it.

"Mr. President?"

"Psycho? Are you there?"

He sounds worried.

"Yeah, I'm here. Is something wrong?"

"Listen to me. The Matthew McConaugheys are *not* peaceful. We just received word from NASA. Matthew 
McConaughey, the original, the one from True Detective and stuff, he's an alien. He was the first. A scout meant to 
analyze the land. They are looking to colonize a new planet. They are going to attack us!"

"*What?* I ask, looking up at Matthew McConaughey. He smiles at me.

"And they are shapeshifters, but in reverse."

"What the hell does that mean?"

"It means they can transform anyone they want into a Matthew McConaughey. Do you understand me? Psycho?"

I don't answer. I'm still looking straight into Matthew McConaughey's eyes. I feel weird inside, like my organs are fighting each other. Like I'm about to be sick.

"Psycho, whatever you do, *do not let them touch you*. That's how they transform people into McConaugheys. Do you understand me?"

I still don't answer.

"Psycho, don't let them touch you, ok!? Ok!?"

I hesitate a couple of seconds. I smile at the Matthew McConaugheys. Then I bring the phone even closer to my mouth... and I whisper to the president;

"All right."

#### [WP] During a flight you accidentally damage a window and find out that they aren't actually windows, but monitors.

Score: 1646

"Sir, calm down. It's alright, everything's going to be alright. Please, calm *down.*"

The stewardess is growing increasingly flustered, trying her best to push the agitated man back into his seat. The passenger has a maniacal gleam in his eye as he once again stands up despite her attempts. 

"Do you see? Do you see what's happening?"

He bellows to the people around him. They had looked bored, gazing blankly into screens or out the windows, clearly just waiting for the trip to end. Now here was a chance for some in-flight entertainment. A man stands up but wavers - he's not sure whether the attendant needs his help or not.

"Look!"

Folding his thick fingers into a fist, the man smashes it against one of the windows. One of the other passengers gasp in horror as the stewardess ineffectually pulls him back down. There's a hairline crack in the window now, and a slow line of blood is dripping out of his hand. Uncaring, the man slams it into the window again.

And the window flickers. The outside distorts, warps and fades. Mutterings in the audience grow louder even as the man calms.

"What's going on here, then!"

"What is this?"

"Where are we? I want to see the pilot!"

The stewardess is white now, hand lifted over her mouth in horror. The man besides her sits, begins to talk nonchalantly.

"I saw it when I was looking out, you know. There was a grey bit at the corner there." He nodded towards the now dead screen. "Thought it was dust. I tried to rub it off, tapped my fingers on the screen. But it got larger. And then I knew."

"What are you hiding from us, hmmm?" His face twists into a snarl. "What's out there?"

"Right. I've had enough of this." A businessman, red-faced and angry, strides straight over to the pilot's cabin. Grabbing the heavy fire extinguisher, he heaves it up, then starts hammering at the door to no avail.

He turns to the side door. Once, twice, thrice. A noticeable dent appears. 

"No... Sir, please, stop..." The stewardess pleads, her voice reedy under the strain. "Please!"

With a grunt, the man smashes a hole through.

And the water gushes in.

#### [WP] You wake one morning and find your reflection in the mirror is gone. A few seconds later it rushes in mouthing the words "Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. You ready?"

Score: 1624

The first thought that came into my mind was: *Have I been turned into a vampire?*

Maybe not a reasonable reaction. Vampires, of course, are *fictional*. Not to mention that I'd had garlic with dinner last night, and that that dinner wasn't human blood. Maybe I'd been reading too many vampire romance novels. Don't judge me.

But really, what else was I supposed to think? How could I not be in the mirror??

"I" showed up a just a few seconds later and apologized for the delay. But there were still some things off. "My" hair was tied back in a ponytail instead of the frizzy mess on my own head, and "I" still had streaks of makeup on my face. Clearly I'd forgotten my pre-bedtime ritual. But "I" simply waved a hand over "my" face and everything became exactly as it should be. No more mascara, no more smudged lipstick, and hair looking like I'd been electrocuted in the night. Meanwhile "I" was a mirror image again.

"What the hell?" I asked. "My" lips moved too, just like they were supposed to. No answer from "me" either.

We both stared at each other. 

"Come on," I said. "What was that about? I know you can hear me." "My" mouth made the exact same movements. 

There was another pause.

"Fine," "I" answered. It sounded like listening to someone speak while you're underwater. Kind of muffled or something. "You caught me, OK?"

"*What is this?*" I was practically screaming at this point. Thank god I lived alone, or my roommate would think I was having a nervous breakdown. Hell, *I* thought I was having a nervous breakdown. 

"I just had a long night," "I" answered back. "Derrick came over, and I forgot to set an alarm, so..."

"Derrick?" My face was practically pressed against the mirror now, studying "Me" and "I" was leaning back away from it. "Derrick *my lab partner*?" The utterly gorgeous, charming, funny, sweet guy who only talked to me about what parts of the lab journals we would be doing? "I" was going out with him?

"I" nodded back with a smug smile. 

"...How?" I managed to gasp. It was either that, or asking how the sex was. Which I desperately wanted to know as well.

"I" shrugged back. "I'm the *confident* you," "I" answered. "That's the point of the mirror. To show you at your best. I didn't just wait for Derrick to notice me, I made it happen." For the first time, I noticed the hickey just peeking out of "my" shirt. That hickey should be on *my* chest!

*I'm definitely still dreaming,* I decided. I'd fallen asleep looking at his facebook page again, and this is what happens. 

"Right," I answered. "It's just that easy."

"I" grinned. "It was for me. What's holding you back from just asking him to dinner or something?"

I didn't have a good answer to that. Well, really, I had *too many* good answers for that. I closed my eyes and shook my head, trying to wake up from the dream. And when I opened them again, "I" was back to copying my every movement. No matter how much I yelled at "myself" to answer... it was back to being just a mirror again.

----

"Hey, Derrick?" My voice came out all high and squeaky. *God, what's wrong with me?*

"Hmm?" he answered, still peering into the microscope at whatever we were supposed to be studying. Some type of cell or something; I'd been too busy staring at his arms to really listen closely. 

"Would you... I mean, are you free for dinner sometime?"

He didn't answer right away. He looked up from the microscope with a squinty, suspicious look. Around us, the rest of the class was busy talking and chatting and doing their assignment. We just stared at each other while I felt my cheeks burning bright tomato red. *I'm going to kill Mirror Me*, I resolved. *I'll shatter that thing the second I get home.*

Then he smiled. "I'd like that."

I nodded and tried not to jump for joy or throw my arms around him. I just gave him my number on a little scrap of notebook paper.

"You know," he said slowly, still looking at the paper, "I had the strangest thing happen to me this morning..."

#### [WP] Instead of dead mice, your cat starts leaving cash and small bags of narcotics on your porch.

Score: 1617

I knew it was a bad neighborhood when I first moved in, but there was nothing to be done about that. What else could I afford on my salary? It was either this, or pay $800 a month to share someone's closet on the Upper West side. There were bars on all the windows, cockroaches in the cabinets, and drug dealers conveniently located on every corner. Dizzy adapted to the new location quite well, though. I'd rescued her from a shelter two years ago and I was the only human that she trusted, so she was quite happy to not have any roommates. She wasn't at all worried by the nightly sound of gunfire and wailing police sirens. 

Dizzy had been an outdoor feral cat in her past life. She was a tough son of a bitch, though you'd never know it from seeing her flop on her back and ask for belly rubs whenever I walked through the door. There was still some part of her that still longed to go out there and hunt. It hadn't been possible in our last place, but she managed to find a hole in the wall of the new place just large enough for her to sneak through and get outside. I kind of panicked when it first happened, given how many shady Chinese food restaurants were nearby. But Dizzy always came back, happy as a clam and carrying a little present for me. She was such a good provider: sometimes I'd get trash, or freshly killed rats larger than some of the smaller dogs you see carried in purses in the garment district. But sometimes... well, I don't know where Dizzy got it, but she started bringing back cash in neat little rubber-band-wrapped stacks. I hadn't intentionally trained a cat burglar, but I couldn't deny that the little extra bit helped. I always made sure to buy her a can of the good cat food with it as a reward for doing her part. 

A few weeks after the money, she started bringing home little baggies full of drugs. Usually just weed, but sometimes harder stuff. Coke, heroine, pills... I didn't want anything to do with that scene, so I'd throw them out immediately. I didn't want cops to find that on me somehow, and I *certainly* didn't want the nearby gangs to think that I had been somehow stealing from them. I told Dizzy not to bring those back anymore... but she's a cat. It's not like she could understand what I said. I tried boarding up her exit hole, but nothing worked: every day I'd come home to find it open again. How she managed to move an entire stack of textbooks is far beyond me. I was just dreading the day that someone would find her stealing their stash and follow her back to my place, and I'd come home to a whole gang in my living room or something.

I worked late on Christmas Eve. Everyone else at the store had chosen to take vacation all at the same time, and I was the only one staying in the city over the holidays. Mostly because I was the only one who couldn't afford to go anywhere. Naturally Mr. Henderson decided to keep the store open to 11 despite how short-staffed we were. So I found myself stepping off the train at the dead of midnight facing a long, cold walk back home. And I wasn't alone.

"Hey man, you lost?" A voice called from behind me. I quickened my pace and shot a glance over my shoulder. Two figures wearing dark hooded sweatshirts were walking behind me with a confident swagger. I kept my head down and scanned the street, looking for anyone else around who could potentially help me. No luck; the stores were all closed for the holiday, and no one else wanted to be out on the streets this late either. I'd never seen anywhere in NYC so desolate.

"Hey, you got a light?" one of them called out. 

"We just want a smoke," the other said. I broke out into a full run, and I could hear their sneakers pounding the sidewalk after me. And then another dark figure stepped out of an alleyway right in front of me, holding some sort of large blunt object right in my path. He was at least two feet taller than me, and built like a mountain. One swing of that bat would knock me head clean off my shoulders. I was cornered.

"How much you go on you?" they asked, checking the streets for any sign of cops coming. "Give us your cell phone too."

"Please," I said, holding out my hands and backing up against a streetlight. "I don't have anythi..."

"Oh *shit*!" one of them said. He pulled off his hood and came closer, studying me under the light. "Shit, man, this is Big D's boy!"

The others looked at me like I was a circus freak. "You sure?" one of them said. The one who'd first identified me reached into *his* jacket pocket, and pulled a slip of paper or something out, and held it up next to my face. I was able to glance over and see that it was actually a picture of me. The one from my sister's wedding that I kept in a drawer by my bed... how had they gotten that? Had someone broken into my apartment??

"Fuck, man!" I could see panic in their eyes as they each traded glances, then they all turned back to me. "Listen, we didn't mean nothing. Here, why don't we walk you home? Make sure you get there all safe." The mountain with the baseball bat loomed over me, and as he took off his hood I could actually see *sheer terror* on his face. All I could do was nod in response. They fanned out like a Secret Service detail and guided me back to my apartment. I was too scared and confused to ask how they already knew the way there. 

"We're sorry again," one called as I stepped toward the door and got out my keys. "Please don't tell Big D what happened!"

"Uh... I won't..." I said slowly. I didn't know who Big D was, so telling him was kind of impossible anyway. They stayed on the sidewalk and watched me as I quickly opened the door; I was still worried that this was all some sort of trick to get me to open the door to my place and then they'd rush in and rob me. Not that I had anything worth stealing. But they maintained their distance, so I slipped in and immediately locked the door behind me.

"Mrow!" Dizzy was waiting, as always. Poor girl had been waiting for her dinner for hours. I rubbed her head, still in daze from what had happened. We went into the kitchen, where I saw her latest present waiting on the counter: a big stack of bills, at least $600. 

"Dizzy... you..." What had those guys all said? *Big D*? She rubbed against my leg, twitching her tail and looking up at me with wide eyes. "Did you..."

*No way. That's just crazy*.

"Never mind. Let's get you a can of food, Diz."

#### [WP] You are forced to take a genies place, and can only be freed once you have granted 10 wishes. The catch: You have no magic in any way.

Score: 1617

"I wish Jenny felt the same way about me that I do about her," said Pete.

At first I tried to think of an "evil genie" way out of this one. Maybe I could find someone named Jenny who had no idea who he was, and he had no idea who she was either, so technically, they both felt the same way about each other. Then I remembered the *Aladdin* clause. "You can't wish for love. Or to bring someone back from the dead. Or more wishes. Sorry, should have mentioned that!"

"Oh, right," he said. "Okay. A billion dollars!"

"Actually - little known fact - you can't wish for a billion dollars," I said.

"What? No, I'm pretty sure that's not one of the rules. There's at least a few genie-related billionaires on that Forbes list."

I thought for a few seconds. "Actually those guys didn't wish for a billion dollars. They wished for a lot less and then made good investments," I said. "Also, inflation."

"What's the limit? What's the most I can wish for?"

I put on my best poker face and said, "seventy-three dollars and fourteen cents."

"What? *Why?*"

*Because that's how much money I have in my savings account,* I thought. What I actually said was, "our magicks work in mysterious ways."

"Ugh. Fine." Pete seemed to take that at face value. "Okay. How about this – I wish I could bench 315 pounds."

"Hmm. Now that I can do!"

---

"One more! Come on! Push!"

Pete struggled, but was finally able to get the bar back up.

"That was great Pete. That's all for today. Remember - make sure to get at least 150 grams of protein today, and don't forget to take your creatine. I'll see you back here tomorrow."

"Thanks Genie," said Pete.

If Pete stuck to my nutrition plan and kept up the good work, he'd hit 315 in a couple weeks. One wish down, nine more to go.

#### [WP] You've come to save the princess, but she's not guarded by a dragon - She's guarded by a very aggressive goose.

Score: 1610

Before the goose the hero stood,  
Gallant, brave, and wise,  
And far beyond the princess could  
Be heard through muffled cries.

"Oh goose" the hero called with glee,  
"Ere long you will be dead,"  
And thrust his spear toward the fiend,  
To put the thing to bed.

But woe, alas, alack and more,  
The goose, it dodged the blow,  
It screeched the most almighty roar,  
And airborne did it go.

Now chimed the goose from dizzy heights,  
"A hero? Pah! A fool.  
What makes you think you have the right,  
To take my crowning jewel?

For she and I," the goose went on,  
"Are princess and the prince,  
So take your mangy steed, begone,  
Or I'll turn you in to mince."

"Foul goose," returned the hero then,  
"My life or yours, now fight!"  
And skyward did his weapon point,  
Now glinting in the light.

"You silly man!" The goose exclaimed,  
"You heroes never learn!"  
For all at once he felt a pain,  
Then dropped the spear and turned.

A dagger nestled in his side,  
A voice said "there's no use...  
Why would I want to have a man  
That tries to fight a goose?"

Score: 1609

My alarm blares, and my bloodshot eyes open.  The sun has not yet risen, and I long for the comfort of sleep.  But sleep is for the weak.  And my mission demands sacrifice.

I open my laptop, squinting as the screen illuminates the room.  The clock at the corner of my screen reads 5 AM.  Soon, the east coast of the United States will be waking for work.  There is no time to waste.

I open the word document entitled "Project Mayhem."  Inside are thousands of writing prompts, 80% of which begin with the phrase "You wake up one morning to find...".  I run my finger down the screen, admiring my handiwork and pondering which ones to post this morning.

**"Batman wakes up one morning to find that he has become the Joker."**

**"Hitler did not die in a bunker in 1945.  Instead, he traveled back to 1925 and attempted to assassinate himself."**

**"You wake up one morning to find that you have 24 hours to convince the president to dismantle all nuclear weapons.  Oh, and one more thing.  You're his dog."**

**"No time traveler has ever successfully assassinated Hitler.  That is because Batman was sent back in time to protect him.  You are the Joker, and you must prevent WW2"**

**"In an alternate universe, Half Life 3 is hated and Comcast is revered."**

**"A magician begins to discover that his tricks are not tricks at all.  In fact, his magic is real.  End it with him finding himself in a mental institution.**

**"God is put on trial for crimes against humanity.  The result is a hung jury."**

**"A time traveler accidentally kills his parents, forcing him to become both his own father as well as his own mother.  (NSFW!)"**

**"You arrive in heaven, only to find that it is populated by lawyers and pedophiles.  Also, you are Hitler."**

**"On a whim, you exclaim 'I'd sell my soul for a grilled cheese sandwich!'  A red hand with long fingernails taps you on the shoulder.  Include a fiddle duel in the story.  Also, make sure your protagonist wins.  And make sure to- actually, fuck it.  I'll just write it."**

**"A little boy tells you that he sees dead people.  Include a plot twist in your response."**

**"In an alternate reality, men put women in the friend zone.  Especially my bitch ex-wife, Alice.**

**"You wake up one morning to find that people have power levels displayed over their heads.  One day, you meet somebody with no power level displayed.  Instead, he has a halo."**

**"You die, only to find that heaven is populated by the cast of Harry Potter."**

I jump between alternate accounts, posting prompt after prompt, each more nauseating than the last.  [Wannabe writers post their pathetic Batman fan fictions, fighting over points that don't exist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2afkkh/eu_bruce_wayne_discovers_he_was_actually_adopted/ciuksmb?context=3)  Once I have posted all my godawful prompts, I begin phase 2.  I scroll through the page at lightning speed, laughing as I downvote any prompt I did not post.  

**"A man is introduced to a son he never knew he had."**

Downvoted.

**"A world leader contemplates whether or not to go through with a nuclear strike."**

Downvoted.

**"A parent suspects their child may grow up to be a serial killer."**

Downvoted.

I refresh the page, admiring the lineup of blue downvotes I have created.  Now, it is time to create my responses.  I throw together a few circlejerky inside jokes until my responses surpass the 25 word minimum.  Once my lazy, uninteresting responses have been formulated, [I include a link to my personal subreddit and post my monstrosities.](http://www.reddit.com/r/thisstorywillsuck)

My work completed, I return to sleep.  I will need my rest if I am to create more bland, uninteresting prompts.  I dream pleasant dreams of the subreddit I have sabotaged.

Also, I am secretly Hitler

Score: 1607

"You can't stop me," Jerry yelled, clutching at the railing and looking down at the churning river far below. His head whipped wildly back and forth, looking at Sam then back at the river, to and fro. "I've made up my mind! I have nothing to live for, and I don't want to hear your psycho-babble mumbo jumbo."

"Me?" asked Sam with a harsh, self-deprecating laugh. He clambered over the railing and sidled up to the very edge of the steel beam. "I'm not here to stop you. I'm jumping too."

"Oh," Jerry replied, clinging the fence even tighter despite his threats to let go. "Well, good. Confirms what I thought in the first place," he said with a sardonic chuckle. "Nobody in my life cares enough about me enough to stop me anyway. No friends, no girlfriend, no parents..."

"Hmph" Sam snorted as he edged along the very rim of the bridge. "*That* is why you're jumping? The worst thing about your life is that you're not weighed down by any anchors? I should be so lucky! Try having two ex-wives each claiming 50% of your paycheck in alimony. Try having a mother who constantly criticizes everything you do. Try having two kids who only call you when they need something. I would give *anything* to be in your position, man. Shit, I'd just leave. Start over somewhere new. Go to China and teach English, go backpacking through India..." He gave Jerry an angry look. "Man, what are you even doing here? You have it made!"

"At least *you* have family that notices you and knows who you are. You've *had* the life that I want. You had the wife and kids; I can't even get a girlfriend," Jerry replied. "Sounds nice enough when you say 'oh, just go travel' like that. You're forgetting all about the fact that I'm completely broke. I couldn't even afford the plane ticket over. I have no skills, no charisma... no nothing. I just spend all day at my dead-end job, wishing I could go back 10 years ago and actually do something after high school."

Sam moved a bit closer to Jerry. "You don't know what you're talking about. I did it. College, grad school... the fancy job and the big office... It's not what it's cracked up to be. I only took this job as a way to pay off my student loans, and then I was going to go off and be a writer. Now, 25 years later, I'm in even more debt than when I started! You ever heard the term 'Golden Chains?' It means that once you get that big salary, you can't just go back to working another normal job. You have to use all of your money just to keep your current status. I'm going to break those chains, today. By jumping."

"You're crazy, man. You have everything you need to succeed. You've got the career, the work experience... I can't even get my foot in the door! You're successful and you're clearly a pretty smart guy. How is *this*," he gestured at the cold grey waters below, "your only option? I'd be willing to bet that you have all kinds of friends and colleagues who would lend you a hand if you just *asked* for it. I don't have a single person in my life, man. I don't have anyone I can rely on."

They were each silent for a moment. The wind picked up, threatening to knock each of them from their tenuous hold on the guard railing. The waters below seemed to grow louder, as if calling out to them. Beckoning them to the cold depths.

"Kid," Sam said. "Get off this bridge. You have your whole damn life ahead of you and you're just being stupid and angsty. So many people have a hard time dating and getting jobs when they are younger. Go download tinder and start at a trade school, for Christ's sake. You don't even realize how insignificant these problems are!"

Jerry didn't reply. He lowered one foot over the side of the bridge like a toddler testing the waters of a pool. 

"Here, here," Sam said. He pulled out his checkbook from his breast pocket and moved to straddle the fence railing. With a fancy gilded pen, he wrote out a check. "$10,000. The final scrap of my savings. It is my last request that you take this and go live the life you want. And you can't deny a man's last request. Go travel through Europe or something. Go find yourself." He scooted across the edge to Jerry and handed it to him; the small scrap of paper flapped temptingly in the wind.

Jerry slowly pulled himself back over the fence and took the check in a trembling hand. "You mean it?" he said, staring at the check like he still wasn't sure it was real.

"I mean it," Sam responded. "It may be too late for me, but maybe I can live vicariously through you."

"It's not too late," Jerry said quickly, placing a hand on Sam's wrist. "Come on. We can both just start over."

Sam pursed his lips and smiled; tears began to well up in his eyes. He looked back down at the river, considering Jerry's words.

"I can't," he said. "But at least I did one meaningful thing before my death," he said sadly. With one fluid motion, he threw himself over the railing and off the edge of the bridge, plummeting into the abyss below.

#### [WP] Aliens invade earth. To the surprise of humans, the alien's weaponry is pitifully outdated.

Score: 1606

“**Stop Mortal and Bow Down Before Your Masters!**” The gelatinous blob shouted. The marines entrenched outside the Whitehouse didn’t budge. The horde had appeared mere seconds ago, and the secret service was still securing the president.

“Drop your weapons and stand down!” The head sergeant shouted back. There were hundreds of the things, and they all had weird battle axes. The sergeant thought that was strange, but if they had teleportation capabilities then the axes must’ve been more than they seemed.

“**The armies of Zog Will Crush Puny Humans!**” The leader of the blobs shouted again, using a tentacle of ooze to raise his axe above his head.

“I repeat. Stand down or we will open fire!” The sergeant ordered.

“**Chrage!**” the blob leader ordered, sliding forward with his axe poised to smite. The sergeant couldn’t believe he was unlucky enough to order the opening volley of humanity’s first interstellar war, but the rules of engagement were clear, and the president’s life was at stake.

“Open fire marines!” He shouted, and 50 calibers joined in with M16s in showering lead down on the oncoming alien infantry. Snipers form the roof landed shot after shot into the onrushing horde. It was all to no effect. The bullets were merely absorbed into the gelatin of the blobs, and didn’t seem to harm them in the slightest.

‘That was why they used ancient weapons.’ The sergeant thought. ‘Their defensive powers are so great that they don’t need advanced weaponry’. Realizing he was now doomed to a gooey death he flipped his rifle to full auto, belted out a war cry, and ran forward to meet the lead blob. If he was going out. He was going out with his boots on.

The cries of his fellow marines joined him as they too broke cover to meet their fates. Upon reaching the lead blob the sergeant took the butt of his rifle and slammed it into the lead alien. He was not surprised at all when the thing slurped it out of his hands.

The sergeant drew his side arm, but before he fired he looked up to see the thing bring its axe down on his head before he could fire a shot.

**”Bonk.”** The blob said as the axe rebounded harmlessly off his head.

**”Bonk.”** The blob said again, hitting him a second time. The sergeant was so shocked to still be breathing that he just stood there and let the thing tap him on the head with the apparently foam axe.

**”Bonk.”** A blob next to him said as it whacked another marine on the head with its foam axe.

“What the…” The sergeant said.

**”Blargle! We told you not to use the teleporters!”** A much larger blob had appeared and was turning an angry shade of red as it addressed the smaller blobs.

The blob that had smacked the sergeant shrunk back, and then vanished into a silvery mist, along with all of the other blobs.

**”Sorry about that.”** The remaining large blob said, appearing to someone wring its non-existent hands. **”You know how kids can be, always so excited to play ‘invade earth’. Do you mind if we try this again? We were going to make a grand entrance on the lawn before we had the peace talks with your president, and it would be horribly awkward if our first contact scenario was a couple blobblings playing with the local security forces**.”

Edit: spelling and stuff.

They call him Silent Tim, on the account he won’t tell anyone his real name. Actually, he doesn’t say much to any of us. Only a few us are lucky enough to get a grunt or two in response to a question. Some have given up trying to get anything from him. Others believe he may have the answer we’re all searching for.

Whatever he knows, I’m determined to find out.

I have to get back to my family and friends – to my time. I can’t just sit here and waste away like the others who’ve given up. Not as long as there’s still hope.

I make my way across the room to Tim. He sits in a chair, aimlessly staring into space. If from the constant stream of drugs the orderlies gave him or his own insanity, we don’t know. Or maybe he’s the sanest of us all. It takes some superhuman patience to not lose your mind after being here so long if the rumors are true.

As soon as I get within his peripheral vision, his body tenses. It’s slight, invisible to the unobservant eye, but I notice it well enough. Taking a deep breath, I prepare myself for rejection.

“Hey,” I say, giving a slight smile. “Tim, isn’t it? Whatcha thinking about?”

No response.

I bite my lip. It’s as I expected. I’ll just have to push harder.

“I heard you’re the first patient they admitted here. That must be something special.”

A grunt. It’s progress, I guess.

The other patients glance at me. Their expressions vary, some sympathetic while others mocking. I look forward, focusing on Tim. I couldn’t let them stop me now.

“I’ve been meaning to ask you something. Since you were the first, maybe you know why –”

“Go away!” Tim exclaims, sitting forward in his chair.

I nearly jump out of my skin, backpedaling before tripping over my own feet. My arms move too slow, failing to catch me before I land on my ass with a deciding thud. It hurt, but nothing in comparison to my beating heart. A few snickers rise from the crowd but then there’s silence.

That's the first time he has talked to anyone of us.

But Tim doesn’t stop there. He stands out of his chair, red-faced. His fists are balled, shaking as his muscles strain under his paper-thin skin. I flinch, expecting for him to pounce on me like a predator does its prey.

“You’re not real!” he spits. “Just go away! You ruined my life!”

Tears stream down his face, the fire in his eyes dying. He buries his face in his hands but they barely muffle his deep sob. Everyone backs up slowly, as if unsure what to think.

The door to the room flies open, a pair of large orderlies rushing in. They beeline straight for Tim, restraining him with their stone faces. Once forced back into his chair, they inject him with a syringe of some clear fluid. He mumbles under his breath as he still fights against their combined strength, his eyes rolling into the back of his head.

“Not real… none of you guys…”

He falls to sleep, his expression softening. Still, a few tears escape the corners of his eyes. One of the orderlies turns to the other, sighing and shaking his head.

“They don’t pay enough for dealing with that loon. He really thinks he can see other people.”

“I know,” the other responds. “And to say they actually come from different time periods? Definitely insane.”

Once they make sure he is restrained, they turn and make their way out of the room. I try to move out of their path but they ignore me, walking over me. No – through me. It was as if I didn’t exist, a hologram instead of a physical thing. Before I can say anything, they’re out of the door as fast as they came.

There is silence in the room, no one knowing what to say. Instead, we all just look to Tim, realization creeping into our minds like a sudden winter frost.

#### [WP] Every time the Messiah returns, we kill him. It is now the Thirty-seventh Coming, and Jesus is getting sick of our sh*t

Score: 1601

Jesus glanced over at his wrist and sighed heavily. It appeared to be nailed to an irritatingly familiar wooden frame once again. 

“Oh, come on," he hissed. It had only been a few hours since his latest resurrection, since he'd attempted to welcome his people with open arms for the official thirty-seventh coming of Jesus. Upon his arrival, however, something had immediately smacked him against the back of his head and knocked him unconscious. “Are you serious? Are you serious right now?”

“I’m so sorry,” said a man knelt down in front of him, some sort of hammer-like tool clutched in his right hand, several nails in the other. He was a younger male, probably around the age of 23, with long blonde hair and a short, curled beard. He wore a black, government issued suit, the dim, fluorescent lights overhead making it appear slightly more yellow than it actually was. “Really, I am.”

“Then why are you doing this?” Jesus said, thrusting his body upward in an attempt to free himself. The nails in his palms pulled against his skin slightly, but refused to budge. He glanced over at his left wrist. They’d gotten really damn efficient at the whole crucifixion thing lately. The first time, they’d had to use dozens of nails, hammering each one in at a crooked and near diagonal angle. Now, however, they’d managed to get their trade down to just two per limb. It was great that they were learning, but he hoped it would’ve been under a different scenario by now.

“You know why,” the man said, standing up slightly and stretching his back. He then knelt back down and lined one of the nails up with Jesus’ left foot. He hated this part.

“Come on,” Jesus said, closing his eyes and thrusting his head back. He pulled his hands upward again, but they still refused to budge. He wasn’t going anywhere, not this time. In fact, he’d only managed to escape once out of the thirty-six—no, thirty-seven times they had crucified him thus far. He was caught within minutes and re-attached to the crucifix he’d become way too familiar with. 

“Sorry,” the man said, his voice trembling slightly. “It’s not really up to me.” He nodded toward the opaque, mirrored window at the opposite end of the room. Yes, it was nice to no longer be getting crucified out in the middle of a desert, but the fact that he was receiving his crucifixion in a much more sanitary government building did little to ease his discomfort. It was more luxurious, yes, but it still required him to be crucified. At least he didn’t have to see the eyes of the onlookers that stood behind the one-way mirror. 

“I’m Jesus Christ,” Jesus said, glancing down just in time to see the man lift the hammer above a nail held over his foot. He closed his eyes again, a wave of pain emanating from his right leg and washing over his body. “Oh, Jesus Christ,” he said, acutely aware of the fact that he'd just used his own name in vain. The phrase had become an unfortunate habit at this point, thanks to the hours he spent watching television while waiting to die during each crucifixion. That was one of the few changes he was actually quite fond of, that they allowed him a few basic amenities as he slowly asphyxiated and starved. Now if they would only just stop killing him, that would make things fantastic. “Come on. Can’t you use at least some sort of anesthetic first? Why do you guys need to keep doing it like this?”

“Does it still work with anesthetic?” the man said, hammering Jesus’ foot like someone attempting to hang a picture. He was the least efficient crucifier that Jesus had worked with in the last few years, missing the nail several times and instead smacking the hammer into his flesh on more than one swing.

“Yes,” Jesus said, squirming. “Of course it does. Why wouldn’t it?”

“I don’t know,” the man said, abruptly ceasing his hammering. He stood up and took a step back, tilting his head as he admired his craftsmanship. “I’m not God, I don’t know everything.”

“I am,” Jesus said, gritting his teeth and pushing his head back against the cross. “So could you guys perhaps just stop crucifying me once every few years? I could share my knowledge with you. This is getting ridiculous.”

“No can do,” the man said. “We need somebody to die for our sins.”

“Just go to confession,” Jesus said, now almost yelling. He took a deep breath in an attempt to calm down, reminding himself that they knew not what they did. “Just go to confession,” he repeated, quieter. “Or just sin less. Yeah, do that. Just stop sinning so much.”

The man glanced up at Jesus, his head tilted. “Sin less?” he said, as if Jesus had just said something in some sort of ancient, dead language. 

“Yes, sin less,” Jesus repeated, making sure this time that he was not speaking in Aramaic. It was definitely English. 

The man lifted his hand to his face and softly rubbed his short, blonde beard. “Like, not sleep with prostitutes as often?"

“Exactly,” Jesus said, slowing his breathing as he struggled to ignore the pain in his leg.

The man continued staring at Jesus, his face contorted as if he were deep in thought.

“Nah,” he said, kneeling back down and grabbing another nail from his tool belt. “I really like prostitutes.”

Jesus closed his eyes as he felt the man return his hand to his foot, the cold touch of a nail again pressing into his skin. They were all so stubborn, but that was part of why he loved them. He’d let them crucify him this time, let them get away with killing him to wash away their sins. It was the least he could do. It would probably be the last time, though, he was pretty confident that they wouldn’t crucify him for a thirty-eighth time. That would just be ridiculous.

#### [WP] The bride is having an affair with the best man. During his wedding speech the best man decides to see how heavily he can hint about it without anyone actually working it out.

Score: 1598

John sipped his drink as he stood up.  He shuffled the notes in his hands before glancing across the table.  Despite the white, perfect smile on her lips, Jenna watched him with terrified eyes.  John had felt those eyes on him all day.  Every time he refilled his glass, her smile became more forced.  Her gaze became more cold.

"We, uh," John started, clearing his throat.  "I remember the day I met Michael."  He turned to his left and nodded at the groom.

Michael's smile was as bright and handsome as that of his new wife.  Behind him, Jenna gripped the tablecloth until her knuckles were as white as her perfect, fake smile.

John shrugged, snatched his glass off the table, and downed it one sip.  The audience chuckled as John dropped his cards face down on the table.  

"I've known Jenna since we were little kids," he said, holding onto the back of his chair for support.  "We've been inseparable ever since we were in diapers.  All the way through childhood, high school, college... it was always 'John and Jenna.'  I've always thought of her as a part of my family.  Ron, Samantha," he said, looking at the parents of the bride.  "It's been a long time since I lost my parents.  Even with them gone, I've always thought of you two as the mother and father I never had.  I'll never be able to thank you enough for welcoming me into your family."

The audience applauded.  Samantha had begun to tear up.

"Now, since Jenna and I have always been so close," John continued.  "I'm sure a couple of you were expecting me to be the one walking her down the aisle."  A few people laughed uncomfortably at that observation.

"But I can assure you," John said.  "I think the odds are better that I'd be walking Michael down the aisle.  Because, after all," he said over the laughter of the crowd, "Jenna has never been the type of girl who wanted a relationship.  As early as the third grade, I remember her promising me she'd never get married.  From the day Jenna met Michael, everything about her changed.  She saw the world in a whole other way.  Hell," he said, making eye contact with the bride, "she even started seeing me a different way."

Jenna could not even fake a smile anymore.

John flashed a wide grin at Michael.  "I gotta be honest with you," he said.  "I didn't think you two were going to make it.  The thing about Jenna is, she always wants what she can't have.  I'll admit, I was a little nervous when you started influencing my friend's life in such a dramatic way.  But hey," he said with a shrug.  "I've never seen her happier."

John lifted his empty glass.  "So here's to you, Michael.  Words can't express how glad I am that you met Jenna."

#### [WP] One day everyone notices the words "Human Update 1.1 progress 1%" in the corner of their eye.

Score: 1589

They called it "99% day." How original. The boys in the media must have been working overtime to come up with that winner. Shit, I can come up with better. How about "Updayt?" Eh? No? Fine. Well anyway. May 19th, 2016. That's when the count would pass 99% and fully install.

What would happen?

That's the only thing anyone ever talked about anymore. Thank god for 24 hour news, right? There was myriad speculation and even more bickering, as with most other news stories. Creationists claimed that this was proof that we were designed; evolutionists didn't really have a good counterpoint, but they were sure as hell ready to argue their side. Various religions claimed that this would be the Rapture or whatever their judgment day was called. Conspiracy theorists claimed it was a government mind control plot. Me? Hell, I didn't know what to think.

On 99% day, I did what every other red-blooded american did: got insanely drunk. Ate unhealthy food, shot off fireworks... the whole shebang. Most people were saying that the 1.1 patch would fix this nasty hangover bug anyway, so there was really no downside to it. I gathered all the boys over and threw a huge party. We practically cleaned out the local liquor store and filled a kiddie pool full of margaritas. I'd always wanted to try that. And it was totally worth it; best party I ever had. 

I tried to stay up for the big moment, but you'd be surprised how sleepy a plastic pool's worth of margaritas will make you. I was passed out on the couch at the big moment.

I awoke with a big brass band playing a concert in my skull. I tried to hide under the pillows from the light streaming through the windows, but no such luck. My eyes snapped open as soon as I remembered the occasion. Sure enough, the 'Updating' message was gone, and unfortunately, it hadn't fixed hangovers after all.

A loading bar flashed across my vision, and a pleasant chime sounded. Everything went black for a moment, then I saw the results of the update:

"Thank you for upgrading to Human Vista!"

A shiver ran down my spine. I suddenly noticed the plumes of smoke out the window and heard the faint sound of sirens.

#### [WP] Every generation the five brightest are paired up with the five dumbest in the world for a mysterious test. You are one of the ten, but nobody knows from which group they came.

Score: 1589

We were sat next to each other in that small white room, too afraid to say anything and too anxious to make small talk.

A man with a white coat and a clipboard would periodically open the door and call one of us in, where we would then be quizzed for about twenty minutes or so, and then released back into the waiting room.

The tension in the air was intoxicating. I mostly stared at my scuffed shoes and wondered whether I should have made more of an effort on my appearance. I didn't think I looked bad this morning, but I was feeling it now.

One guy had a slight bored grin on his face, and stared at the wall behind me the entire time. When his name was called, he lazily got up and sauntered in.

It was difficult to gauge the reactions on people's faces when they were let out. Some people seemed distraught, others relieved, and one or two downright happy. 

A name came up but nobody moved. The man at the door sighed and called it again, and my ears went red when I realised that it was my turn. I coughed slighly and put one foot in front of the other, following the now impatient man into the room.

I was sat down and given a glass of water that I was told to drink whilst they connected sensors to my arm and neck. Another man in a white coat sat opposite me on the table, and leaned forward a little too intensely for my liking. I swallowed.

"So what does it taste like?" he asked, nodding at the empty plastic cup and grinning somewhat.

My eyebrows rose in surprise at the question. I had assumed it to be water given how clear it was, but I could feel doubt trickling in when I tried to remember what it tasted like.

"It.. tastes... good" I managed feebly. 

He rolled his eyes. "We know it tastes good, but was does it taste *like*?" he asked more matter of factly.

I probed my tongue, desperately searching for hints of flavour of the strange liquid that had just gone down it, and came up empty. "I-it t-tasted like w-water..." I said, realising how stupid that sounded.

He sighed, raised his eyebrows, and scribbled something down. The paper cup was then removed from the table, and a large jar of dried beans and a ruler was placed in front of me. I could feel my heart beating out of my chest, and my eyes felt red.

Without looking up from his clipboard which he was furiously writing upon, he said "tell me exactly how many beans there are in that jar."

Exactly? I knew which group I belonged to now, and I could feel the tiredness and the misery setting in. I couldn't handle any more of this. I just wanted to go home, back to my little rock where I could see my friends and family again and not worry about what my future was to be based on some stupid aptitude test.

"M-mister please - may I go?" I said, "I don't mind if I fail the test, please?"

He looked over at the mirror as if silently signalling a colleague. He looked back a little more softly. "This is the last question, get through this and you can go home. Just give it your best shot."

I exhaled a  breath I didn't know I'd been holding in, and mutely nodded. I guessed that thirty beans would maybe cover the bottom. I picked up the ruler and measured the height, equalling it to exactly 30cm. I frowned because it seemed a lot bigger than 30cm. 

My face flushed red as I put down the ruler and instead starting counting finger widths to get the height. Sixteen fingers up, and each bean was about the size of a finger. "About 500..." I muttered.

"Sorry?" he asked, staring at me intently.

I cleared my throat. "A-about 500."

He grinned and showed me a piece of paper from his clipboard which upon reading showed the estimates the other's made. All the numbers were in the range of 700-800. Someone even showed their working, with a complex mathematical model to prove their claim. 

"Care to try again?" he asked, again with that intense stare.

I swallowed. Hands shaking this time, I picked up the jar and actually counted the beans lining the bottom. Twenty-eight. This time I used the last digit in my thumb to measure the height, and came up with six and a bit inches. The total was lower. My heart sank.

"A-about 450" I said, staring at my shoes again.

"Sorry?" he asked, almost angrily. 

I couldn't take it anymore, I wanted out. This had gone on enough. Why was I being treated like this? I never asked to be part of this. Who in their right mind gets a kick out of humiliating those they percieve lesser than themselves? No. I was done

"450!" I yelled, and then awkwardly wrenched sensors off my neck and arm. I got up quickly, and headed for the door. No one tried to stop me.

I walked out of the door, ignored everyone looking up at my tear-stricken face, and hurriedly rushed out of the waiting room and out into the free world.

The man in white coat folded his papers and nodded at the mirror where his two colleagues were standing behind watching.

"Her estimate was way off, you know" murmurred the man.

"Doesn't matter. They were all way off. It's her independent methodology that makes her. She wasn't fooled by the prop ruler, and she trusted her senses under extreme duress during the water test. Can't say the same for some of the others."

"She passed?"

"Flying colours."

Everyone knew who the offender was as soon as the word was mentioned. They all had a picture of the offender in their heads; tall, white male with big, clumsy hands. Maybe some imagined him differently, but to her that was what the offender looked like. 

The jury didn't argue for long; they all knew the consequences for what the man did. Life imprisonment. He deserved it. Coming back into the jury room every single one of them locked eyes with the defendant. Not what they expected in the slightest. 

The woman was slim and short, handcuffs strapped around her wrist she watched them pleadingly. Almost immediately the jurors looked to the accuser; he was the tall, strapping handsome kind of man. They wanted to change their decision. 

After all, no matter what the man said; there was no way a woman could rape a man.

#### [WP] A young child summons a demon, but they only want a friend.

Score: 1581

"Are you sure about that?" the demon asked from inside the pentagram that had drawn on the floor in dust and candle wax. He'd arrived from the pits of Hell with horrid horns and terrible teeth, but all of that was gone now. He looked like someone you'd run into on the street, if you happened the run into pitch black shadows with yellow eyes.

Megan nodded.

"That's your command?"

Megan nodded for a second time and then coughed. The machine to her right beeped in protest.

"All right," he said. The glowing circle that was holding him in broke as he took the deal that Megan had offered him. He was to own her soul as soon as she died, but he was going to be her friend until then. 

Megan smiled and then waved him over to the bed she was sitting on. The demon looked from her to the foot of the bed and then plopped himself onto it. He stared at her, his eyes acting like a pair of headlights. He was frankly confused. Demons weren't exactly well versed in the 'best friends' department, but it was his job now. 

"Now what?" he asked.

Megan shrugged and laid down on the bed.

"I don't sleep," the demon explained.

Megan made a circle on her chest with her fist, and then closed her eyes. The Demon waited until morning.

The next morning was similar; the demon asked what to do, and Megan shrugged again. Frankly there wasn't much that you could do in the hospital without one of the nurses wagging a finger at you. Megan basically needed to stay in her bed, and that meant the Demon was going to as well. He did all of the talking while they were there. The Demon only left when the teacher came to remind her how to speak herself. 

In the afternoon the Demon brought her ice cream. She didn't ask how he got it or how he knew that her favorite flavor was chocolate. Megan just let him know that she loved it. He started to bring it every day.

Against the odds Megan ended up getting better, and the Demon was relieved. She was allowed out of the hospital and back into her school. She saw Sally, who knew what was going on, and the other girls who didn't have any idea where she went. Megan's mom had given her this little board that she could write on and clear. It was easier to talk like that than it was to use a language she barely knew. 

The other girls eventually stopped talking to Megan as much because she couldn't really talk back. Sally stopped talking to Megan because the rest of her friends weren't. The Demon still talked to Megan. He knew what she was saying no matter how many ways she said it. Sometimes she said things wrong but he didn't try to correct her. He just smiled with black teeth.

The Demon got Megan ice cream on her birthday again. It was almost their thing now, and as long as it was late at night nobody knew she was getting extra treats. She was ten, which meant she was pretty old.

When she was thirteen, they finally moved her schools. She'd taken to signing to the Demon when people were around, and that just wouldn't do. Her parents said something about isolation, and she didn't agree with them. The Demon didn't either, but she told him that her parents weren't bad people. He already knew that. 

She went to a school where everyone could sign, but nobody else liked the music that she did. In fact, none of them were into music at all. The demon continued to spend time with her, but she had to write to him now. The rest of the kids could hear her hands.

When she was 16, the Demon helped her learn to drive. Her father was trying, but he wasn't very good at it. The Demon wasn't a very good driver either; he'd never done it before, and it made things a little hard. Megan got used to it.On the way to university when she was 17, Megan got into a car crash. It wasn't that bad, but they needed to go to the hospital. The Demon sat beside her in the ambulance.

The nurses ended up putting her back in the same room that she'd summoned the Demon in. The cancer that had taken her voice was back, and it wasn't very happy about her beating it the first time. She lit up the CAT scan like a Christmas tree. She lost in early December.

The Demon didn't cry when Megan stopped breathing. He was calm when she flat-lined, and the Doctors started to panic. She'd been in a lot of pain for the past while, and he hadn't liked it. 

He held out a hand to her once she was pronounced dead, and she grabbed it while also staying still.After all, she'd lost to cancer, but she'd promised her soul to him, and they were friends.

#### [WP] A Starbucks Batista has given you Double Chocolaty Chip Crème Frappuccino with soy instead of a Caffè Vanilla Light Frappuccino with no fat milk. Make this as tragic, heart-wrenching and miserable as possible.

Score: 1581

Apparently being a regular has its drawbacks. For our past 10 anniversaries my wife and I have come to this Starbucks, ordered a Venti Double Chocolaty Chip Crème Frappuccino with Soy (she was lactose intolerant) and shared it in the booth where I proposed. 


I probably should have known better, but I didn't know where else to go today. I couldn't bear the thought of drinking "our" drink alone so I ordered the first thing I saw on menu. A Caffè Vanilla Light Frappuccino with no fat milk, Tall.


The girl who fixed my drink must have recognized me from the last couple of years, because when I heard my name called it wasn't what I had ordered. I guess I'll sit at our booth alone now.

#### [WP] At a regular high school, every student coincidentally happens to be a superhero. Thus far, every student has managed to keep their secret identity a secret. When a supervillain attacks the school, each student believes he/she is the target and tries to maintain his/her secret identity.

Score: 1578

It was a school day like any other at John F. Kennedy High -- up until second period, that was, when a screaming voice addressed the entire student body on the intercom. It was not the principal. 

" Greetings, puny humans of Oshkennock, Ohio. My name is Gravatrix, conqueror of galaxies, destroyer of worlds!"

In Mr. Galvan's classroom, the students listened in terror.

*Oh shit*, though sophomore Susie Comstock, who had been mutated by an alien virus and given the powers of flight and laser vision, *Sounds like some intergalactic shit! He must be here to kidnap me like those aliens that showed up at our last family reunion.*

"I've come for a certain. . . Person in this school," the voice on the intercom continued, "'Person' being a term I use loosely. They're no average human being."

*Fuck, fuck, fuck*, thought Joe Maricci frantically, a few desks away from Susie, *They know about that UFO I found, they probably know I can shapeshift now from the radiation or whatever it was, they're gonna take me away!*

"You know who you are. . ."

*I gotta get the fuck outta here before he discovers that I'm Supersonic Girl*, thought Carly Jackson to herself. 

"And I'm coming for you. . ."

*What the hell am I gonna do, what the hell am I gonna do, what the hell am I gonna do?* was all a wild-eyed Jimmy Roberts could think as he struggled against the urge to blast through the ceiling on his rocket feet.

"So you might as well make it easier on everyone and come to meet me."

All thirty kids in the classroom -- each one of them endowed with a different set of superhuman powers -- shifted in their seats, looked around uncomfortably, and wondered what they would do. Each of them had just resolved to make their respective moves when the thin, bespectacled frame of Mr. Galvan stood up from behind his desk at the front of the room. 

"Kids," said Mr. Galvan, "I know this may come as a shock to you. But I'm actually a superhero called The Galvanizer. Gravatrix is my archenemy. I'll be back in time for dismissal. Stay where you are and don't give Mr. Richards any problems. He can read minds, you know."

And with that, Mr. Galvan was off, shooting toward the principal's office at a million miles a minute.

#### [WP] A serial killer puts his victim through a series of increasingly elaborate and sadistic death games, but his victim is a lawyer and beats everyone by finding loopholes in the killers rules.

Score: 1566

It was a simple question, but the answer was going to determine my fate. “Are you in this to kill or to manipulate?” You see if he was just a murderous sociopath nothing I could say would deter him. No amount of logic, or hell even emotion would tilt the scales even remotely closer in my direction. But that’s not why most people kill. Sociopath, psychopath, these words are so commonly referred to but in practice people who truly exhibit these characteristics are extremely rare. The unflinching, unwavering lack of any and all sentiment, empathy. Purely apathetic to the desires, to the screams of their victims.  For just about everyone else, the killing isn’t the motive but a necessary outcome of the torture. Taking their aggression one step too far. The whole point a perverse dance, asserting a sort of authority, dominance. Feeling the crescendo of power building to a climax of pure adrenaline release. 

“Oh wouldn’t you like to know” he replied. And my pulse relaxed slightly. We were playing a game that only he knew the rules to. At least for now. He was egging me on, desiring a response, to feel the trembling of a voice long lost into my throat. Keeping quiet would mean death. Like a mouse completely disinterested in cheese, the maze simply a set of walls it had no interest in exploring. But I had to play. You see, this is where the hard part really starts. Most of these opportunistic madmen are creating the rules as they go. Not some sort of expertly crafted series of challenges, each one more horrifying. Normally it’s just a bag of tools in their woodshed, the rest a free-exploration of torture. Jackson Pollack if is his canvas were defined by screams and blood. But that’s where the opportunity is, if you can catch it, you can subtly create the rules for them, to direct them into corners.

You might be thinking at this point: “Fuck this. If this story ends with the murderer changing his ways in some sort Dead Poet Society, life affirming transformation.” That’s not the goal, even in the least bit. I couldn’t care about ‘the person deep down inside’. The end game is really no different than anyone else’s. It’s all about opportunity. If there’s a nail on the ground, of course I’ll try and hide it to escape. But where I excel is manipulation. Cause that’s the thing, manipulation for most people isn’t about wits, it’s about exerting force, scaring someone into action. But in a twisted sense of logic wits can direct force, turning the tide in your favor. So he takes out the hammer, I don’t plead for my life. I don’t try and talk to him about his father, or tell him the legal ramifications if he gets caught. I act as inhumanely scared as possible. Scream and yell at the top of my lungs. 

He hits me in the side of my knee, the searing pain is almost unimaginable but I play it up. Consistently reaffirm that he is in charge, and that I could not be in any more fear if he tried. And he loves it, hits me again. And again. Blood pouring down my face. The mix of blood and sweat burns my eyes, I can barely open them. But I never plead for him to stop, never even ask him to let me go. Never bargain or try and change the circumstance. And you can see it build in his mind. This blurred image growing clearer and clearer. This unrelenting stamina and acknowledgment that he is doing the right thing. That nervousness wears off and he is in his element. Which would seem like a terrible thing for me, but fear would be the only thing to ground him at this point. That little tick in the back of his mind trying to get him to stop. Forcing him to make rational decisions. To act with poise. But now it’s all about intuition. And that’s where it starts to fall apart.

Instead of screaming, I abruptly turn the tables. Start calling him a little bitch. Call his mother a whore. Call him a fucking amateur. Spit at his face, laugh maniacally. And I can see the adrenaline pick up even more. He doesn’t want it to end. Keeping me alive is an utmost necessity at this point. He could last for hours. Inflicting as much pain as he can, walking that tight line between torture and death. Making it up as he goes along. He has no idea what he can or can’t do, doesn’t know how easily he could kill me. Doesn’t know how or where the femoral artery is. The jugular. Whatever. And I realize we have hit the most crucial point where it comes down to two options, his next move will either kill me, or will be stupid enough to give me an opportunity to strike back. No games at this point, no certainty. Of course, there has always been true fear throughout the entire ordeal, an innate understanding that death is a possibility. But I am now in a position of hope. And the hammer is no longer a sadistic enough tool, he needs something worse. Dropping the hammer where he stands. Within foot reach. And I swipe it behind me as he paces to death metal in the background, unable to choose the next implement of torture.

Using the clawed end to cut through the rope, he approaches. Slower than I had anticipated. With the sort of grimace that fully denotes a transformation into pure insanity. Body fully in control, a juggernaut freight train running on pure adrenaline. He places a syringe into my calf and the leg immediately goes into convulsions, can feel the blood coagulate, the veins like little tributaries filling up with oil. The venom slowly slithering up my leg. And my estimation of his insanity now quite below the reality. And my advantage begins to wane, my screams now pure and real, his realization of the immense pain, no longer histrionic but intense and real, the tick of doubt re-entering his mind. Undeterred but no longer entirely manic. The convulsions now the only force still cutting the hammer through the ropes bound to my wrists. But now he’s back to calculated, well as calculated as a mad man gets. Places the syringe back in the bag and notices the missing hammer. With a pound of his fist rushes at me.


I’m not going to sit here and make the case that there are inherently good or inherently evil people. That whole Locke-ian ideological struggle looks at mankind in an artificial vacuum. At the end of the day it comes down to this: everyone is inherently selfish. There’s no fighting it. By default, and by necessity your worldview is entirely dictated by how you are placed in it. Every feeling, every perception, every moment of happiness and agony is yours, and yours alone. The difference in people is how that selfishness manifests itself. Some people derive pleasure from other people, from the constant reassurance that, “hey, I’m a pretty good person to be around.” Other’s find it through work, or accomplishments, hobbies. Regardless for its effect on the world, good or bad, there is a certain semblance of self-preservation in everything. Now the point here isn’t to justify this mad men’s actions, but more to justify my reaction following the complete detachment of the rope from my hands. 

The sweat pool amassing in the crevasses of my palms splashes to the ground as my right hand swings forward. My mind in pure reactionary mode, brain stem alit as the rest shuts down from pain. Make contact with his right temple. Blood rushes out as he falls to the ground, unconscious but alive. Enough time for me to make a decision. Crawl to safety, or crawl to the bag. The adrenaline pumping through my veins effectively hovers the bag closer and closer in my direction with each thrust. The world a swirling microcosm of rage and fear. And within minutes, his body a lifeless husk of a man. The rage and insanity a relic of an identity now fully escaped. There were several more syringes of venom in the bag. They were now fully used. He has saws and power tools, now fully dulled and rusting from overuse. My fingers chapped and blistered, my leg a solid shade of blackish purple, my body covered in someone else’s blood. His very being strewn across the wooden floor. 

I woke up in the hospital three weeks later. Leg amputated, broken femur, collarbone. Broken jaw and pelvis. A few timid police officers shuffling at the door nervously talking to the nurses and a lawyer. In a drug induced haze I’m informed I’ll need to give a statement, but that the lawyer is sure I won’t be facing any charges. The mad man a long wanted criminal and with my lack of record, my indecent actions essentially swept aside. The officers, the same men who found me, and well what was left of him, looked at me with shallow eyes, darting back and forth trying to avoid contact. Fully aware of self-defense laws, fully aware of the inhumanity of my capture. But fully in awe, and fully incapable of understanding what might be laying inside of me. The potential of any man to become a leviathan in an act of pure rage. In the name of self-preservation.

"No, please."

She pushed the vial away from her lips, her thin and wrinkly hands shaking. 

"Why?" I asked.

"I... I'm so tired, dear." She sighed. Then she continued:

"My flesh is tired."

"What do you mean?"

"The other ones, my other lives, I've come to realize... they were not *really* me. I've read their diaries, I've memorized the formula. You raised me and I made you young again. I raised you as though you were my own child. But there is no personal continuity between these versions of us and the ones that came before."

There were tears in her eyes, now.

"This is not immortality. Just a series of deaths. A long line of lives we cannot remember, but I swear I can feel the weight of every loss in my bones."

She put her hand on mine.

"I want to sleep."

"But what about our deal?" I asked. "What about us?"

"You will have to find a new one. It will be easy to find somebody willing, but harder to find someone to trust."

I nodded.

"Now leave me. Please. I will have my peace, at last."

I slowly backed out of the room, and I whispered "good bye" as I closed the door.

Walking down the hallway I returned the vial of cyanide into my pocket. I obviously wouldn't need it for this one. That was a first. She'd almost figured everything out, that stupid old hag. She must've been depressed. Whatever. That made things easier for me. Of course the formula lets you preserve your memories! It would be pointless, otherwise. The only reason my partner couldn't remember her past life was because she hadn't lived one. Neither had the one before her. 

I already had the next child prepared. I would raise her as my daughter. Then she would raise me as her son. Then I would kill her. Rinse and repeat. A god doesn't share his throne.

Score: 1557

The Los Angeles Museum of Natural History was, by far, the dullest place on Earth. Cro was sure. 

It was also home.

Does anyone have any idea the emotional impact that comes with people laughing at your small, exposed penis a 
hundred times a day? Does anyone have any idea how hard it is to stand still for twelve hours at a time? Fifteen on 
Sundays?

No. No one does. Only Cro.

Does anyone care when his butt is itching and it's five o'clock, but the museum only closes at eight? Has anyone ever gone three hours without scratching a butt itch?

That shit gives you PTSD.

But it was the only way. For so many years Cro had to hide. To live in the jungle. Had to endure being called 
Bigfoot by people who claimed to have seen him. Sasquatch. Abominable Snow Man.

That one really hurt. He could understand the 'snow man' part, but Abominable was just mean.

Living forever is no piece of cake. It was fine at first, but as time went on, Cro started to look less and less like other people. There was only so much makeup in the world. Mach 3 razors were only so efficient. No amount of shade and mask could hide his simian face, the hair coming out not only from where the beard is on a modern man, but from the ears and the forehead.

There came a point where he had to go into hiding, or risk being burned as a witch.

And then he heard about these new things. Museums, they were called, where they kept replicas of people like him. It was his shot. His opportunity to escape the jungle, to stop scaring the shit out of adventurers tracking through the woods past him while he was trying to take a shit.

To escape being killed by a hungry puma, or worse.

He sneaked into the LA Natural History on a Monday. Now it was fifteen years later, and the day-to-day hadn't changed much.

Stand still like an idiot for as long as the museum is open. Have fun once it's closed. That's your day.

Well… 'have fun'… As much fun as one can have at a museum, which is none. No fun. Zero amount of fun, especially when you've seen EVERY MOTHERFUCKING EXIHIBIT A THOUSAND TIMES.

Yes, I know the penguins are in the south pole and the polar bears are in the north. Yes, yes, I know everything 
about the quirky people from Sentinel Island, who live isolated from modern world.

Yes, I've seen the new display about ornaments from Central America. Yes, I've seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it.

"I've seen it all*, Cro thought, staring at the frozen Homo Erectus on the display next to him. "I'm super bored, 
bro," he said.

For the past thee months, he had had more free time than ever. The museum was closed. It didn't open a single day, and Cro had no idea why. One day people just stopped coming.

Three months of wondering around. Three months of being lost through the empty, eerie halls of natural things and cultures and stuff. And now it was getting dangerous, because the food on the cafeteria was running low, and no one was there to stock it up again in the morning.

"I think I might starve soon, bro," he said to the Homo Erectus. "Or I'll have to risk going out into the city. But no. What if they find me? What will they do?"

The frozen bro didn't reply.

"Yeah, yeah. You're probably right. I should just –"

"Hello."

Cro's eyes went wide. He turned around.

A small girl, not more than nine years old, was standing by the T-Rex fossil, a Jack Skellington doll in hand, eyes 
locked on Cro.

It took a lot of will power not to charge and break the girl's skull with a bone. 

Not that Cro wanted to kill kids, or anything like that. But that damned fight or flight response. 

"Are you lost?" Cro asked. "Did you parents leave you here?"

"My parents are dead."

Cro blinked repeatedly. "Who brought you here?"

"No one," the girl replied, simply. "I came here to hide."

Cro took a few steps towards the girl, his feet against the marble floor echoing loud all across the chamber. The girl stepped back, scared. "I'm not going to hurt you," Cro said. "What are you running from?"

"The monsters."

Cro frowned. "The monsters?"

"They said on TV it was because of the island. They said they found an island that wasn't on the map, and then something bad happened."

"What happened?"

"The monsters," the girl repeated. "Why are you weird-looking?"

"What monsters are you talking about?"

"The island was lost in time, they said," the girl continued. "They said there were creatures lost in time that didn't 
die when they should have died. They said this is some weird 'phenomena' that they discovered recently. Things 
that don't die."

"What things?"

"What does 'phenomena' means?"

Cro crouched to the girl's eye-level. "Do you have anyone that looks after you?"

The girl shook her head. Her eyes flooded in red and water.

"Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. Is there anyone outside right now?"

Again, she shook her head.

Cro nodded. "All right. I'll take you outside, and then we'll get you to… I don't know, the cops, probably."

He took her by the hand and they made way down the chamber. Past the long corridor. Past the African Mammals. 
Past the American Wildlife. Past Alaska Culture and Climate. Past the Bird Cage.

They went down the stairs past the gift shop and crossed the main door into the outside garden. 

The sun blinded Cro instantly. It had been a while since he'd seen it. It was cold. And something was off about the noise around him.

He blinked repeatedly, trying to get rid of the spots in front of his eyes.

He couldn't put his finger around it, but last time he had been out, there was definitely something different about 
the way the city sounded.

The clear blue sky faded into view, one less red spot at a time. Cro could feel the little girl's hand on his, pressing tight.

Then he realized what was so strange about the noises.

"See? Up there," the girl said, pointing to the sky.

There were none. No noises. No cars. No honking. No chatting, no distant stone crushers and no garbage trucks. Just birds chirping and wind howling.

Jungle sound.

"Are you seeing it? The monster?"

Cro followed the little girl's finger. Then he heard a high-pitched screech.

Up in the sky, silhouetted against the mid-day sun, a pair of wings hanged perfectly still in relation to each other, 
gliding upwards. Between the wings, a long, green body ended in a beak the size of Cro's torso.

He looked down at the little girl. Her grip on his hand was tighter.

"They called those Tecopactil," she said. "On TV. When there was a TV, they called it that."

On the fountain in front of them, the clean water reflected the image of the bird flying away against the sun.

"There are others," the girl said. "Bigger ones."

A low thud rang in the distance like a thunder, and a ripple in the water expanded in concentric circles.

Score: 1552

Thirty four. That's how old I was this time. And like clockwork I was sitting back in my childhood home, staring at seven bright candles.

"Happy Birthday to you!"

I looked around, smiling at all of the faces. My mom was there with the same old smile. And as always my dad was standing in the corner with a grin on his face, the heart attack that would take his life wouldn't happen for another ten years. I learned to savor those years. 

As I blew out my candles for the, well, I forgot how many times I had done this to be honest. But I blew them out once again and watched as my friends scrambled for pieces of cake. All of them disillusioned with childhood dreams and memories, half of them wouldn't see those dreams come to light. Trust me, I knew, mainly because I knew more than anyone in this room for being only a six year old, but that was because I had lived a hundred lifetimes compared to them. Even the "adults."

I couldn't tell you why, or how, or even who gave me this "power," but all I knew that every time I died, I would reset. I would go back to this day, April 23rd, 2017 and live my life over again. The first few years I had a lot of fun with it; I played around, I traveled the world, I abused drugs, sex, alcohol. You name it, I probably tried it. Hell, I was even President for a brief time in the early hundred resets. I tried everything, I had been everywhere. I had seen the world and where it was going. But the charade got old, especially after dying by the mafia a couple times. You'd be surprised by how many disgusting ways they've thought up of to kill people.

Trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Growing up over and over again, making different mistakes and creating different problems. Watching your family and friends die in a way each just as horrible as the last only to see them again, happy and unaware of the pain they will endure when you finally reset. It's not fun. And you learn a lot in those years.

You learn that in three years, when you're only nine years old, your family will hit such troubling times that they'll lose their house. And trust me, no one takes a nine year old seriously when you tell them you know the winning lotto numbers. 

You learn that in twelve years your best friend will die from a drug overdose regardless if you take him to rehab or not. 

You learn that in fifteen years your high school sweetheart will be killed in a car crash because you could never convince her to skip that trip to England.

You learn that in twenty-two years your law firm will go bankrupt and you'll have to move back in with your mom, whose so far into substance abuse that you'll move her into a home.

You learn that in twenty-eight years after a hundred lifetimes, you'll be shot by a mugger with nothing left to lose after a night of drinking. Your friends will call an ambulance and after twenty-two grueling minutes you'll die on the way to the hospital. And then somehow, you'll wake up once again staring at seven bright candles.

Some things you can never change. Sometimes no matter how many tries you get, things just have to happen. I didn't always go to law school. I didn't always lose it all. I didn't always get mugged.

But my father's heart attack always came. My friend always died and even if I never became friends with him I would hear it in the papers and live those moments of pain over again. My high school sweetheart would always be killed in a car crash in some place in Europe and I knew the date it would happen, I knew the pain she would feel because I went with her once and I died alongside her. I thought that would break the cycle, but no. I woke up once again to seven bright candles.

There was one lifetime that I repeated a dozen times. A long time ago where I lived through it all, where somehow I overcame the pain and the sorrow and the sadness to see where my life led me.

I eventually married a wonderful young woman. We had beautiful children and we lived in bliss for several years. I watched my sons and daughters become wonderful human beings. I grew old and saw my grandchildren. And I watched my grandchildren run around in my adulthood home. And on my deathbed, when I thought my life was complete, I said my goodbyes and drifted into eternal sleep. I thought it would end the cycle, I thought overcoming the pain would appease whoever gave this disease to me. But, I woke up once again staring at the seven bright candles.

I lived that life several times, each time changing a small detail that would maybe fix some of the problems. But again, new ones arose and I fought past them. I couldn't tell you how many times I lived it, how many times I thought I was doing it right. But each time, I would wake up and stare at the seven bright candles.

So I stopped doing it and I tried something else. But nothing seemed to ever work.

And I knew the actions I needed to take to get back there, I knew the places I would need to go, the people I would need to meet. There's just something about this life.

About knowing that no matter how hard you try, it'll never be perfect. That no matter how hard it is to give up your family, you'll want to see them again. Not in the way they were when they left you, but in the way they were on your sixth birthday.

When you were a kid and they were the adults. When you had nothing to think about except cake and presents and they dealt with the problems of a real life. When all you wanted was to go outside and play and all they cared about was your happiness.

I knew the steps I needed to take to live my "real life" over again, I just never wanted to walk that road again.

So I lived my lives, over and over and over again. I lived out every cliche, every job, in every place. And I tried so desperately to save the ones I loved.

But every time I died, I would wake up.

And I would be staring at seven bright candles.

Edit: First ever gold, thank you stranger! And thank you everyone for the kind words and comments!

*Edit about the Candles:* There have been a few comments about the candles so I am gonna clear some things up. Where I come from (and as I've learned not everywhere) it's tradition to put one extra candle on the birthday cake for good luck. The child is turning six, not seven and this was intentional. Again, thank you all for the wonderful comments and I am enjoying reading all of the discussions happening. Thank you so much!

**Edit:** Wow everyone, I honestly am blown away by the responses, and the gold a second time, thank you stranger! Thank you all for the kind words and comments; I will definitely keep writing. Thank you all so much for the wonderful comments and discussions!

#### [WP] [NSFW] Earth becomes the mecca of sex tourism in the galaxy after aliens find there's little we won't screw.

Score: 1542

You drop the name "Rock Hard" in Andromeda, they'll know you mean me. In the Sombrero Galaxy, hush "Thick 
Snake" in dark alleys or high end millionaire parties – they'll give you my number. In the Kepler system there's a bronze statue the size of the Empire State building in the shape of my cock. You can visit the balls for 10k and you get a dick keychain on the way out.

This wasn't always my job. Before contact I worked counter on an internet café back on the Westside called The Last Internet Café in the Whole Damn World – and I suspect it really was. Most days it was just me, my boss and a fat dude named Kevin used to play Counter Strike with us on the good days, cry alone eating a muffin playing League of Legends in the bad ones. I didn't particularly *dislike* my life back then, but… well, it wasn't my favorite thing ever. It wasn't bad, though. Just mind numbing.

Suicide actually requires taking initiative, which is why I suspect I never considered it for real – this should about sum up my time at the Last Internet Café.

It all changed with contact, though. There was no way I could have known. Come on, tell me you knew that aliens liked dorky, short guys with trouble making eye contact? Tell me anyone could predict that acne was so popular in the universe it couldn't even be called a fetish – it was an alien fetish in the same sense Channing Tatum is a human fetish. No one knew. No one expected it. 

Me? I did the best out of my situation.

That meant travelling so much, seeing so many places, all for free. Actually, not even for free -- I got paid for it. Meant plowing the shit out of fat green dudes in the Sunflower Galaxy, sure, but that's fine. Parties in the Coma Cluster big like the whole planet was an episode of Girls Gone Wild, man, I'll tell you. I've been to them all. I've seen it all. Even had myself more than a few marriage proposals (one by a lovely seven headed lady, consul of the Small Magellanic Cloud, who offered me -- I shit you not -- seven suns and a shiny silver goat that could talk for my hand. Sometimes I think about that majestic goat and I wonder…).

My point with all this is: A year after contact I was the shit. Earth was a giant brothel, and I was the most expensive whore in the house.

"Which is exactly why we need you now, Greg", the president tells me. By his side on my couch are a number of suited men I've seen by the president's side on TV whenever he gives speeches – vice president, CIA president, whatever, whatever – also two small dachshund dogs sitting in armchairs side by side eyeing me with dark eyes and drinking my whiskey.

"I don't know", I say, blowing the smoke from my n. 05 Montecristo. "I have an appointment at seven with the duchess of Hoag's Object. I'd hate to break that off, she's a good client."

"We need you, Greg", one of the dachshund says. "This is important."

Those two dogs are from… I wanna say the Cigar Galaxy? But I'm not sure. They're IP, I know that much, which is Intergalactic Police, which means that this is serious, and I should give it more attention, probably. 

The good life made me a bit arrogant, I have to admit. And I like my life too much to get myself involved in this.

I get up, tying my silk robe. "I don't think so, gentlemen. I'd love to help out, but I don't want to. But thanks for coming."

What is happening, they told me earlier, is this: A number of men and women – all of them fitting a description similar to me (meaning fatty, oily, awkward-looking people who are always sitting right in the middle of an odd numbered row when the teacher asks the class to make pairs) have gone missing, and the IP suspects of intergalactic kidnapping. Nerd human trafficking, plain and simple. They have a lead – fat dude name Golgrabatch – but no way to get to the guy. What they want from me, the president says, is that I present myself and my services to Golgrabatch. No way he's going to deny, they say. Not with my beard starting bellow the chin and the way my thighs look on top of sandals and socks. They want me to go with him. Want me to be a mole. Want me to find out if he took the sexy nerds, and where to.

Like I said, I want no part in this mess. Life's too good for me to want another job. I just want to get myself ready for the duchess -- I still gotta clean my XBOX controller, she's got a thing where she gets off watching me play and eat Doritos. I don't judge.

"Perhaps we were unclear, Mr. Williams", police man dachshund one says, jumping out of the chair and bobbing his ass towards me. "We've already had your assistant contact Golgrabatch and set up a date at his place. There's a ship waiting for you outside. We weren't asking."

I look from the police man to the president. He shrugs. "It's either this or Intergalactic Jail, Greg."

I sigh, scratching my head. I think back on all my experience as a secret agent – playing Metal Gear Solid on the PS3 and Goldeneye on the 64. I take a deep breath, running my hand through my hair.

*Shit.*

"All right", I say, putting out the cigar. "Go fetch my fedora", I tell the president. "And someone tell the duchess we'll have to reschedule."

#### [WP] In the year 2018, a mysterious, giant tower appears in the deep jungles of Latin America. Thousands have entered it, no one has ever been seen coming out. In the year 2021, you decide to enter the tower. As the doors close behind you, a huge sign lights up "Level 1".

Score: 1540

The jungle was deep and it had already taken weeks to hack through to get here. This wasn't my place in the world, I was a city boy, but I'd been forced into this, compelled by actions greater than myself and now I was here, outside the huge tower. 

The dense jungle had been my second biggest problem on the way here, the first had been the constant attacks by the monkey troops that lived in the area. From the moment I drew near to the structure, they had done everything in their power to stop my getting here, but they had failed. 

The tower stretched above me, huge and ancient, inside was my destiny, but I was tired and hungry and the wonder was lost on me. A screech from deep in the jungle reminded me that it was getting dark and the monkeys would be back soon. I'd managed to kill several after their last attack, but there were always hundreds more - at least it gave me something to eat. 

The door creaked open and I pushed inside the dark tower. The jungle had spilled inside, through every crack in the walls and creepers and roots were thick across the floor, but it was fairly secure and after wedging the door closed, I felt fairly sure I would be safer here than I had been for weeks. 

I pulled a hunk of monkey from my bag and then found my matches and began making a small fire and roasted the meat over it - for once I would eat well. The light danced on the stones and once I had eaten, I began to explore the space. 

Across from where I had entered were the ruined remains of a staircase. They had mostly fallen down from above and blocked the way up, but there were gaps and I could see a way through the rubble; that was for tomorrow though. As I moved away I just caught a glimpse of something carved in the wall "Level 1". It made my blood run cold. 

I slept well and woke at first light and before long had pulled aside the rocks that blocked the stairs and worked my way through. Above, the next few floors of the tower had collapsed and the floor was thick with stone, but beams still criss crossed the tower, close enough to climb, although it would be difficult. 

In half an hour I had pulled myself up to a small upper area and then the first noise came. It was a shuffling scrape, like huge footsteps with something dragged and it came from high above me. Through the dust and the broken beams I peered, trying to see up, but before I saw it, I heard it. A primal scream which echoed back and forth and then a deep grunting. 

It moved out onto a ledge and I finally saw what I was up against; it was the king of all monkeys, a huge ape with vast bulging muscles and his small eyes were fixed on mine. He screamed again, the noise shaking something primal inside me and then grabbed a piece of stone and flung it at me, sending it bouncing through the beams. 

It missed, but he was already looking for another and I realised I would need to move fast. I scrambled up, pulling myself up the beams, avoiding the stones and other detritus that the monkey flung at me and getting closer and closer. Then I heard the sob. 

He heard it too and turned, screaming at the small bundle beside him that I had ignored, but I was now close enough to see was a pink dress. My heart leapt, *she still lived*. How she had ended up here I didn't know and why the monkey king kept her I had no idea, but she was there and still alive. 

Energised I redoubled my efforts, leaping like a simian myself, getting closer and closer. The huge ape threw things more quickly now, but he looked worried too and soon I was near enough to be able to smell him. With a final wild leap I flung myself onto his platform and clawed my way to standing, but when I stood, it was too late, he was gone. 

A rain of pebbles made me look up, the monkey king was far above me, already making his way to a higher platform. The chase was on, I pulled my red cap low and flexed my aching muscles, I could not fail this test.

#### [WP] "She said she loved him." Insert the word "only" anywhere in this sentence. It must be the final sentence of your story.

Score: 1529

She said she loved him, and she did. More than anything. The way her eyes were closed made her seem at peace. He wept silently kneeling on the floor with his face in his palms. His tears fell through his fingers onto the note she had written and made the ink run down the paper. A small ocean breeze blew through the open window and her limp body began to sway from the ceiling in an eerily gentle fashion. She always said she only lived for love, he loved someone else.  She said she loved only him.

#### [WP] On his death bed, Christopher Robin tries to explain to pooh the concept of death. Pooh and his animal friends have not, and do not age, so they have never had any experience with it.

Score: 1529

“You see," began Christopher with a long sigh. "It's like sleeping for a long, long time."  

Christopher Robin was surrounded by his friends under his favorite tree. It rested on the top of a hill overlooking the entire Hundred Acre Wood. He was older now, and he knew that he didn’t have much more time left with them. 

"But going to sleep means that some day you'll wake up." Pooh said with a smile.

"Precisely!" Owl exclaimed.

"And we'll be here when you do," Kanga added. "I’ll even make you breakfast." 

Christopher couldn’t help but smile. "I would very much like that. But you all have to understand that it will be a very, very long time."

"Oh ho ho! We are great at waiting a long time! Rabbit here waits every year for the carrots to grow in the garden." Tigger chimed in. 

"And every year you destroy them!" Rabbit snarled.

"But Christopher!" Roo interjected, jumping into Christopher’s lap. "What are we going to do when you’re gone?" 

"Oh I won't be gone Roo. I’ll be right here." Christopher placed his finger over Roo’s heart. Roo giggled and scrunched up into a ball.

"We'll be just fine," muttered Eeyore. "I’m used to being alone anyways." 

"None of you will be alone! You’re a family now, and while I’m gone you will all take care of each other." 

"B-b-b-ut you will b-b-be back r-r-right Christopher?" Stuttered Piglett.

Christopher let out a soft sigh and looked around at all of his friends. It was going to be difficult to help them to understand. They probably never would…

"Sometimes good things come to an end. But here’s the secret everyone— come close!" They all huddled together underneath the tree to listen to Christopher’s secret.

"Memories. Are. Forever." He whispered and tapped Pooh on the nose.

"Memories?" Said Pooh. “Well I have plenty of those! Like that time we saved you from the Heffalumps!" 

"Or when you helped me fix my garden!" cried Rabbit.

"Or when you organized my library for me!" Exclaimed Owl.

"Or that time you built me a new house out of those sticks you found in the woods.” Eeyore added sullenly. “It didn’t last the night...but I remember it." 

"Yes, yes! All of those are memories and you will have them forever. Just like I will have my memories of all of you." 

Christopher stood up and took one last look over the Hundred Acre Wood. The sun was setting in the orange autumn sky and the trees were beginning to lose their leaves. It was time he went home. 

Christopher gathered all of his friends together and began walking back down the hill. They were all busy discussing the memories they had had with each other. 

"Christopher?" Pooh said, looking up at Christopher as they walked hand in hand. "You aren’t coming back, are you?" 

Christopher looked down at the ground and took a moment before he responded. "No Pooh. I won't be coming back this time." 

They walked in silence, listening to the sound of the crunching leaves underneath their feet.  

Pooh suddenly stopped and looked intently into the ground. "I believe I am going to miss you Christopher," he said with a soft, broken voice. 

Christopher leaned down and took his lifelong friend into his arms. 

"I will miss you too Pooh. I will miss you very, very much."

#### [WP] A superhero tries to get himself classified as a natural disaster so people can get refunded by their insurance company when he destroys their home during a fight.

Score: 1526

Dale shuffled through the papers and sighed. Captain Thunder's massive frame was stuffed into one of the chairs across from the desk. Every time the big hero shifted, the wooden furniture would squeak in protest and threaten to collapse. The brawny hero was built of at least three hundred pounds of pure muscle, and Dale's office manager always bought the cheapest balsa-wood-quality furniture. It was only a matter of time.

"Mr. Thunder..." 

"*Captain*," he interrupted with a flashy grin. 

"Yes. Sorry again. *Captain* Thunder... I can't process these." Dale pushed the folder across the desk.

"*Why*? All the paperwork is there!"

Dale picked out one of the forms at random. "Let's have a look at this one, shall we? A theater owner claimed that his building was destroyed by a tornado? How often does that happen in California on a cloudless day? I checked the weather reports."

Captain Thunder glared. "But look, there are all of these supporting statements from bystanders!" He tapped one sausage-sized finger on top of another folder containing hundreds of affidavits, all witnessed by none other than Captain Thunder, Notary Public. "They all saw the tornado too."

"Well, I have a statement from this 'Lord Magma,' who claims that he was there that day." Captain Thunder's face turned into a smug yeah-I-definitely-beat-that-guy-up type grin. "I visited him in the prison hospital to ask about this supposed tornado. He claims that you threw him through so many of the theater's walls that the entire building came down on top of him, resulting in many many injuries."

Captain Thunder suppressed a laugh. "Well I guess there is karma in the world after all. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy."

"And," Dale continued, "Every one of these other claims also seems to revolve around mysteriously-appearing tornadoes that *also* coincidentally seem to land on top of people that you dislike."

"You mean villains," Captain Thunder growled. 

"Mr Thunder, I'm not...

"*Captain*," he broke in again.
 
"Yes, well, *Captain*. I'm afraid that I'm not here to judge right and wrong; just to decide whether damages are covered by our policies. And as you know, we've already determined that your vigilante actions do not constitute lawful enforcement, and thus your damages are not covered. No matter *how* destructive you or your rivals are." Dale held up one manila envelope. "I mean, here's a whole football stadium that was razed to the ground! Do you know how much that costs?"

Captain Thunder didn't answer. He was just staring out the window. Des Moines isn't necessarily the most scenic town, so Dale wasn't sure exactly what was so captivating. "Captain Thunder? I'm sorry, sir, but we're not going to be able to process these. As much as we all appreciate your services to the nation..."

Captain Thunder didn't even seem to notice that Dale was speaking. Just staring at blue sky and fluffy white clouds with a sort of bemused grin. 

"Well..." Dale was starting to get uncomfortable with the silence. "I'll just file my conclusions then. Now if there's anything else I can help you with..." 

"Sorry," Captain Thunder finally answered. He stood from his chair, so tall that his perfectly combed hair nearly scraped the ceiling. His massive frame even blocked the light from the overhead lamp. He leaned over Dale's desk and planted two ham-sized fists right on top of the paperwork like a hulking silverback gorilla. "I just thought the weather looked a little stormy out. You know..." He grimaced and leaned in even further, an inch away from Dale's face. "*Tornado weather*."

There was a brief moment of silence with Captain Thunder just *daring* Dale to break eye contact.

"I'll just go ahead and approve these..." Dale whispered, hurriedly reaching for his stamp.

#### [WP] Obama grows a beard. Putin reacts, growing a beard also. Things escalate.

Score: 1519

“You like it, right?” Obama said, winking at Putin as un-sexually as possible. He didn’t want Putin to think he was coming on to him, especially considering they were meeting in Russia. He’d briefly considered not winking, but it just didn’t feel right. It was worth the risk.

“No, it’s stupid,” Putin said, crossing his arms and pouting his lip slightly. Obama knew he was lying, knew that he was more jealous than Michael Bay catching his wife at a firework show. Who wouldn’t be? It was magnificent.

“I know you do,” Obama said, running his hand through his beard and pulling at the strands. They were rough to the touch with an almost artificial texture, yet still felt convincingly real.

“It looks terrible,” Putin said, a tear welling up in his eye. He glanced away.

“Do you want to feel it?” Obama said, leaning his chin closer to Putin. 

“No,” Putin said, his arm twitching slightly as he visibly resisted the urge to reach out to it.

“Go on,” Obama said. “Rub it. Feel what I’ve created.” Obama knew he hadn’t actually created it, that it had only been made possible by pulling all of NASA’s funding and investing instead into a top secret beard-research program. Michelle had argued, said it was “probably more important for us to explore space than ensure you can grow a beard,” but Obama insisted. She was a woman and didn’t understand what it was like to be baby faced, to suffer through the decades without the aid of a supple, supportive beard. Now she couldn’t keep her hands off of him, but feigned as though it were simply a coincidence. Yes, and it was also a coincidence that his approve rating had risen to almost 95% since giving birth to his new face-baby.

“No, I won’t do it,” Putin said. “I think it looks dumb.” He bit his lip.

“You’re just jealous,” Obama said, stroking his beard. He could feel the artificial roots buried deep within, the small, still-scabbed holes that had been inserted not a month earlier. He’d remained out of the public eye while they were visible, claimed he was taking a “vacation” on Martha’s Vineyard. In truth, he’d been back in the White House, sitting at the Resolute desk and watering his beard like a farmer feeding his crops. He’d done almost nothing over the past thirty days other than nourish and nurture his beard, giving it anything and everything it desired. He needed to be sure it looked as rugged and manly as possible before he launched his plan.

“Am not,” Putin said, re-crossing his arms and looking off to the side. His face was clean shaven, like a newborn baby with Alopecia.

“You wish you could grow one, but you can’t,” Obama said. He shoved his right hand into his beard and began massaging it. “Only good leaders can grow beards like these. That is why you should give me Russia.”

“Shut up,” Putin said, turning back toward Obama. “I can totally grow a beard. I just don’t want to. Russia is mine.”

“Don’t you lie to me,” Obama said. He attempted to smash his fist down on the table, but it refused to move. It seemed his right hand had gotten stuck in his beard. This was not the first time it had happened. In fact, he’d gotten his entire left arm caught earlier that morning. One of the secret service men had helped him pull it out, carefully untying the various strands of thick, soft hair that grasped at his forearm. Now, however, Obama was alone. If Putin knew he’d been captured by his own beard, everything he’d worked toward would be ruined. Russia would remain a threat. He carefully placed his right elbow on the table and pretended to be simply resting his hand on his chin.

“I’m not,” Putin said, “I can grow a great beard.”

“They why don’t you do it?” Obama said, subtly tugging downward whenever Putin blinked.

“Because it makes you look like a girl."

“What?” Obama said.

“Huh?” Putin said.

“How can a beard make someone look like a girl?”

“Shut up,” Putin said. “I can grow a beard, I just don’t want to."

“You mean you can’t,” Obama said, laughing. He carefully leaned his head back as he laughed, twisting his head left to right as he did so. His hand would not budge.

“I can!” Putin shouted, standing to his feet. “Fuck you, I can.”

“Do it then,” Obama said.

“Fine, maybe I will.”

Obama remained in his seat. Normally he would have stood up to counter Putin’s body language, rising to his feet and towering over him with his superior height. However, his beard-crisis made it impossible. There was no way Putin wouldn’t realize he’d been captured by his own facial hair if he were standing. There would be no way he'd surrender Russia to him and his beard.

“Go ahead,” Obama said.

“Fine,” Putin said. He closed his eyes, his face squishing and turning red as he appeared to push, like a mother struggling to give birth to a severely overweight baby. A high-pitched squeak escaped his lips, followed by a low grunt. He opened his eyes, the color slowly returning to his face, then turned and walked to the mirror in the corner of the room.

“Doesn’t look like it worked,” Obama said, twisting his tangled right hand wildly as Putin looked away.

“Shut up,” Putin said, pushing the mirror off the wall and watching as it shattered on the ground. “Just shut the hell up.” 

“It’s not too late,” Obama said. “You can still come over here and touch my beard. You know, since you can’t grow your own.” Just one touch, that's all he'd need, and then Russia would be his.

“I can grow my own, god dammit,” Putin said. “Give me a minute.” He turned and power-walked out of the room.

Obama grasped his right hand with his left and tugged down with all his might, pulling in the opposite direction with his head. It refused to budge. He lifted his left hand and carefully stuck it into his beard, searching for his right as he pushed the strands aside like an experienced survivalist on a jungle expedition. He found them wedged just in front of his chin, a thick rope of beard hair wrapped around each finger. His left carefully meandered over and began freeing the right. He made a mental note to invest in a tiny machete.

“Done,” Putin shouted as he ran back into the room. He was shirtless now, his chest clearly fresh-shaven and raw. Several strands of what were obviously chest hair seemed to be Scotch-taped to his chin, with a thick mustache colored in above his lip using what Obama guessed was a navy blue Bic pen.

Obama stared at Putin, both of his hands now buried deep within the jungle of his beard. He knew he looked a bit conspicuous, but Putin seemed quite distracted now.

“You didn’t grow that,” he said.

“Did too,” Putin said, wandering over to the table and sitting back down. “I just grew it a minute ago.”

“I can see the Scotch tape,” Obama said, carefully freeing his pinky finger from within the confines of his beard.

“No, that’s lather. I lathered it up.”

“And you also clearly drew in the mustache.”

“No,” Putin said. “Nope. No way.”

“Yes,” Obama said. The last strand of hair released its grip as he tugged down on his hand, finally escaping from his own beard-labyrinth.

“It looks better than yours,” Putin said.

“Let me," Obama said, reaching out before finishing the sentence, "feel it.” He grasped the end of what looked like Scotch tape and pulled down, removing it and half of Putin’s artificial beard.

“Hey!” Putin shouted, standing up.

“I knew it,” Obama said, holding the tape to the light. It was clearly not a real beard, just as he’d suspected. “You couldn’t grow a beard if your life depended on it.”

“Fuck this,” Putin said, slamming his fist down on the table. He turned and walked toward the corner of the room, opening a drawer and pulling out a small, glass container. “I can grow a beard, I just don’t want to right now.”

“Right,” Obama said. He resisted the urge to resume stroking his beard, fearful that he’d again become stuck. “What’s that?”

“This is your country’s demise,” Putin said, walking back over and setting the glass box down in front of Obama. A large, red button sat inside, with the words “YES RUSSIA FIRE NUKE AT AMERICA?” written on it. “You think I'd just let you into my office for peace negotiations and not have a contingency plan? Can you guess what this is?”

“Does it fire nukes?”

Putin stared at Obama, his eyes wide in disbelief.

“Shut up,” he said, flipping open the glass case.

Obama squinted and pushed with all of his might, an unfamiliar feeling gushing out from the artificial roots on his chin. His beard quickly shot forward, increasing in length almost instantly, and wrapped around the glass box, tangling Putin’s hand as it did so.

“Hey!” Putin shouted, his hand wrapped within Obama’s glorious beard. “Get off of me!”

“Did you just try to nuke my country?” Obama said, pulling Putin closer with his beard. It was wrapped around his entire arm now, slowly spreading up and toward his shoulder like the roots of an over-excited tree.

“N—no,” Putin stuttered. “I just, uh,” he paused, his eyes locked on Obama’s beard.

“Accept it,” Obama whispered.

Putin closed his eyes and flung his face forward, rubbing it up and down against Obama’s massive beard. He left out a soft sigh as his head disappeared beneath it, the strands of Obama’s hair wandering down Putin’s neck.

“It’s so nice,” Putin said, his voice muffled by the hair.

“That’s right,” Obama whispered. “That’s right. Embrace it. Now I am going to lead Russia, yes?”

“Yes,” Putin whimpered, his hands grasping at Obama’s beard like a baby at its mother's teet. "Yes.”

Elephants are big but this one is unique. Almost the size of the sun but blue. He's flying, without wings obviously.

Ninjas everywhere. This poor man is surrounded by them, he will never make it out alive. Or maybe they are protecting him?

The most simple garden in the world. One huge flower. I wonder if it's harder to take care of one big flower or a bunch of small ones?

''Sorry I kept you waiting Mr. Price. You can sit now, we'll discuss your son's recent behavior...''

Her voice drew my attention away from the kids drawings on the wall. Teachers - Parents meetings, always a pleasure to attend them.

#### [WP] After years of battles hard fought, at the close of a Civil War, Steve Rogers retires from the Avengers. Hanging up his shield and uniform, he settles down in a quiet little neighborhood, where he is known as simply as Mr. Rogers.

Score: 1517

"Thanks, Mr. Rogers!" little Tameka grinned up at him as she nuzzled her kitten.

"It was nothing," Steve smiled back as he clapped his hands free of dirt and bits of wood. "Just try to keep Pumpkin inside for a bit longer; it might be a little too soon for her to explore outside."

"Kay!" his young neighbor nodded before scurrying off.

Steve kept the smile on his face as he walked back inside his house.

When he saw her washing the dishes, his small sense of satisfaction instantly vanished.

"Your garden is beautiful," she told him as she scrubbed some greasy mess from a frying pan.

"Thanks. If I knew you were coming, I would have saved some chicken for you," Steve ventured in a neutral tone as he took his place beside her. He began to dry   off the dishes.

She shrugged, keeping her green eyes trained on the soapy pan. "I prefer not to make prior arrangements. Life's hectic enough as it is, and I don't like to break off engagements when emergencies pop up."

"I understand."

The two stood in silence, and while Steve never looked directly at her, he would glance at their reflection from the window above the sink.

Natasha looked as she usually looked: stolid, focused, lovely. He preferred this side of her to the deadly assassin she was.    

"So how's the team?" Steve finally asked.

"Hmph," Natasha grunted. Most other people in the world would assume she was being neutral and cold, but Steve was not most other people. This was her at her most friendly. "Same old same old: Thor's as gorgeous and naive as ever, Loki's still scheming, Tony's ego is bruised because that Squirrel Girl mutant managed to beat Doom when all his plans and tech failed, Clint's still a pain in the ass, Fury and Maria are still hardasses, and Bruce... Bruce is feeling better, now that we have a pretty solid contingency plan for the big guy."

He dared a glance at her. "And you?"

Her green eyes flashed, and for a second, he thought he could see a ghost of a smirk.

"Same old same old," Natasha repeated. "And you?"

Steve stopped drying dishes, took a deep breath, and stared at the ceiling.
"Alright."

"I can imagine," she said as she rinsed the last cup. "Getting kittens out of trees tends to make people feel 'alright.'"

"Why are you here, Romanov?" Steve demanded.

"I'm visiting a friend," the Avenger stated simply.

"I *know* you," he snapped. "I know what you're trained to do, and I know what you did to Bruce and Loki when we first started this whole misadventure."

Natasha looked at him for the first time. What little amicability she had vanished. "I'm here to visit a friend," she repeated. "S.H.I.E.L.D didn't ask me to get you back on board, and Tony didn't come whining to me to get the band back together. I'm here because I had some free time and I wanted to see how you were doing."

Steve scrutinized her for a moment. Far too many people assumed that she and Clint were the weak links in the Avengers, seeing how neither of them possessed Thor's strength, Iron Man's technical genius, or Captain America's reputation, but Steve knew better. Like a black widow, she seemed small and innocuous, but also like a black widow, Natasha could lure the unsuspecting into her web and take down foes far more menacing than her.

But looking into her eyes, Steve was (mostly) sure she was being honest.

"I recently got certified to be a carpenter."

"You always seemed like you preferred to work with your hands," she commented as she sat down at the table.

Steve nodded as he joined her. "Back when I was a kid, pretty much all the guys in my neighborhood worked with their hands."

"Well, I'm happy for you, grandpa."

"I guess I am, too."

"You seem uncertain."

Steve nodded again. "Don't get me wrong, I like working with wood and nails, but... I still wish I was doing more good."

Natasha shot him a dour look and raised an eyebrow.

"Not like that!" he scowled back. "You can help people without your fists, you know!"

"So if the supersoldier and superhero business isn't how you want to help people, how would you go about it?"

Steve looked away, and felt a small blush tinge his cheeks.

"Well," Natasha said in a comforting (by her standards) tone, "none of your ideas have ever been too egregiously stupid, so it can't be that bad."

"I want to make a television show," he blurted.

"I didn't know they had those back then."

"You know what, Romanov--!"

"Relax," she stated, her voice stolid. "I'm kidding."

"I don't know, it's just... the world's different than what it used to be, and while a lot of things have improved, I think we lost some values that we really shouldn't have."

"And how do you plan to fix that problem with television?"

"Well, kids seem to be spending a lot of time in front of those things, and you know how kids are: they mimic what they see. Maybe if I'm giving them something good to mimic, then the world will be a better a place."

And Natasha smiled.

"We must keep moving!"

"We can't! Our people are tired! Please! We must stop and rest! Just for a little while!" Yelled the elder as he hunched with hundreds hurdled in the snow.

"No! Look! The eye is closing, we must stay in the eye!"  

I pointed in the distance past the snow capped mountains, dark grey clouds loomed closer and closer bringing cold wind and rain. I stared at the elder, his eyes red with tears. We had to keep moving. 

"My people! We must be always moving! We must stay in the sun!  I know it's been a long time. You are tired. You must trust me! I know the caves are close! It is our death we are trying to outrun.You must not let it catch you now!"

The elder burrowed his eyes in his hands. 

"I cannot go any further."

I walked to the elder kneeling down beside him.

"Then stay. Stay here. Meet the Gods, but give me a chance to bring our people to life."

He began to cry heavily. I brought myself up and boomed. 

"My people! We must move! Now! The caves are close, I can feel it!"

Hundreds gathered themselves up and begin to move forward, I rushed ahead. I know the caves are close. We must keep going. We will find the caves. 

I looked up at the sun, it glared down brightly on us but brought us little warmth. I walked faster and faster as we began to make our accent up the last towering hill.

"My people! The caves are near! We must not lose hope! Over this last hill we will find the caves! I'm sure of it!"

I could hear them all behind me. Breathing heavy. They were tired. I began to run up the hill. I had the energy. I had the hope. I began to run. Cold wind burned my face as I began to increase my pace with excite. I saw the summit. We were close. We were so close. This would buy us time, I turned back towards my people.

"We are almost there! Please do not lose hope!"

I began to run faster. The summit only feet away. Finally victory. All these months we've have moved. All these months with little rest. Little food. We've lost hundreds. I would not let mother nature beat us. I would not let her beat me. I gave my last energy to eat up the last couple feet remaining of the hill. 

We had finally made it. I have done it. 

I came to the summit and stared. 

And stared. 

And stared. 
 
And stared. 

I felt them behind me. Their footsteps fell silent as they stop and waited. I heard their eager ears clammering for the good news. 

"What do you see! Do you see the caves?"

They asked with excitement. 

"No."

They began to mutter among themselves as I turned and bowed my head. 

"What do you see? What is it?" 

I looked down at them. All their eyes bright with hope looked up at me. I spoke. 

"The coast."

#### [EU] Bruce Wayne, age 121, has died of a heart attack in his sleep. Friendless and forgotten, the only ones to attend his funeral are fellow heroes in costume, honoring the true face of their fallen comrade. After a few words from the priest, Superman steps up to the podium to give a eulogy...

Score: 1511

The world has lost something today. We've all lost something today.

To the world, Bruce Wayne was merely an eccentric billionaire who was only as good as the next juicy headlines the media could get out of him.

To us, Bruce Wayne was a friend. A guardian. And a solemn reminder.

The Justice League has often been described by the people of Earth as "gods among men." I've never enjoyed that title, but when we can leap tall buildings in a single bound or move faster than a speeding bullet, I can understand where it comes from. Yet Batman, Bruce Wayne, stood among us as a "man among gods" whose only superpower was the indomitable human spirit.

He reminded us that we're not above those we serve and protect.

And he reminded us that we have no excuses to fail. For he didn't need powers to stand up to any of us. So how much more capable should we with powers be, to stand up against those who wish to destroy us?

Today, we say farewell to a founding member of the Justice League and, by far, the most dangerous man I've ever met.

The world has lost something today. We've all lost something today.

... I lost a dear friend today.

#### [WP] A prolific serial killer active for many years is concerned about his run of good luck. Never discovered, he has also never seen the slightest mention of his work reported on in any media. With today's victim he gets a clue as to why...

Score: 1510

I hate them. They're corpses already. Walking, breathing, talking, pissing corpses without a soul, sucking the life out of everything around them. They're corpses, and yet they live. They live in the homes of their families, they live in trailer parks, they live in retirement homes.

Fucking old people.

We pay for them, pay so they can live out meaningless days and years, accomplishing nothing, doing *nothing* except taking up space, pissing and moaning and voting Republican in every fucking mid-term.

I hate them so much.

What I do is a goddamn service to humanity. By now I've killed dozens, but I curse the fact that there's only one of me. I wish I was an army so one night I could march into every goddamn retirement home and kill every last one of those disgusting, smelly fuckers all at once. Sure, there will always be more old people, but at least for a little while, I could get some goddamn peace and quiet.

I'm not an idiot. If they knew what I was doing, they'd call me a murderer. A fucking murderer! I'm just putting an end to the farce, the absurd joke that says these decaying piles of shit actually have a life with any meaning. If these fucking parasites had any goddamn self-respect, they would have ended it themselves the minute they realized they couldn't use the fucking bathroom without help.

In the wild, they'd be picked off by predators so they wouldn't slow down the rest of the herd. And that's all I'm doing: picking off the ones that are dragging down the rest of us so we don't have to deal with their shit any more.

Tonight, it's going to be Willard Macarthy. Sixty Two. No wife, no next of kin. The fucker has three different kinds of cancer eating him from the inside-out like termites eat a house, and absolutely nothing left to do in this world except eat shitty retirement home food and watch daytime television, and yet still he refuses to just die.

During the day, he pissed himself walking from the cafeteria to his bed. The one thing he has to do all day, and he fucks it up! And of course, because I'm the janitor, it's my job to clean that up. Every goddamn time one of these creaking skeletons pisses the floor like a poorly-trained pet, I hear about it, and every time, I'm the guy who has to mop it up. Every fucking time.

I hate them so much.

That's right, I'm thinking of you, Willard Macarthy. Thinking of you and planning your much-needed exit from this world as I smile at you and tell you, "it's okay, it's not your fault", you fucking incontinent human waste. That's right, asshole. Relax and go off to bed. I'll be in later to tuck you in.

And night comes, and the staff makes their rounds, and I go to the room of Mr. Willard Macarthy. Just in case, I hang a "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door. Do you know we have those? Like a fucking hotel! There was actually a law against it, in case one of these old fuckers had a heart attack or a stroke and the employees didn't notice it soon enough, and you know what those old morons did? They put a goddamn law on the ballot requiring retirement homes to have them! Said it was important that they had a right to privacy! And it passed! Can you believe that? Well, you old fucker, you get what you voted for.

Willard is lying there still. For a moment, I hold out hope that the bastard kicked it before I got here, but after watching closely, I see there's no such luck - he's still breathing. But not for long.

In my hands, I hold the murder weapon - a pillow. The idea is, if they die of asphyxiation in their sleep, well, it could have just happened naturally. Choked on their own spit, slept wrong, who knows. Years killing these fuckers, and no one has ever given a second thought to them keeling over like this. Why would they? Everyone's just waiting for them to die anyway.

I approach with the pillow quietly, and he doesn't move, doesn't wake. And slowly, slowly, I lower it down, and push it onto his face.

And at that moment, he started thrashing. Holy shit, this guy moved fast! He reached his hands up to me, up to the pillow, and looking at them now, this close, I saw that his arms were thin and wiry, but strong. Shit, maybe even strong enough to push me off, strong enough to stop me!

But... he didn't. His hands seemed to instinctually try to  push me away or rip the pillow off his face, but he stopped himself just short of grabbing me or the pillow. He thrashed wildly, desperate for air, but never made a concerted effort to push me off. It was strange, like I was being attacked by a feral animal, yet protected by some invisible force field from some science fiction movie.

I have never had a night like that. The others... some fought me, but were too weak to stop me. Some didn't even wake. But never before have I felt so sure that one of these creaky useless old-timers could rip me apart, and never before have I felt like there was something other than my own bulk and strength that was keeping them at bay.

Gradually, the thrashing slowed... slowed... and stopped. And as Willard Macarthy's hands lowered to the bed, it became clear that whatever strength was in him before was almost spent. Everything became slow, and then still, and in a few moments, he would be gone.

That's when I heard it. It was weak and muffled by the pillow, but in the still of the night, it was unmistakable. And when I heard it, it chilled me to the bone.

"Thank you."

What the fuck? I took the pillow away, but by the time I did, he was gone. What the fuck had just happened? "Thank you"? Was that some sort of joke? In my confusion, I looked around, and that's when I saw the note.

It was left on the nightstand next to the bed, and looked like a letter. It was handwritten in a precise, neat scrawl on clean white paper. And it was addressed to me.

"To Mister Shawn Everett Anderson," it read, "You do not know me well, but in my younger days, I was a Navy Commander. My military career was my life, and for every waking moment of my adult life, I dedicated myself to my country, which I love dearly. For this reason, I never took a wife, never raised a family. I took my duty to my country very seriously, and placed my service ahead of all other considerations.

"Three years ago, I was diagnosed with liver cancer, despite never having touched a drop of alcohol. This was followed soon after by the diagnosis of two other types of cancer. Soon, I spent every day in pain. Feeling no longer able to serve my post to my full capacity, I retired from the Navy.

"The pain quickly became overwhelming and constant. I have been prescribed every medication imaginable for my pain, but it has not helped. Meanwhile, doctors told me my prospects for survival were slim... yet three years later, I am still here, in a state of constant agony.

"As the days stretched on and the torture continued, I often contemplated suicide. But I am a law-abiding man and a god-fearing man, and I could not bear to think that my final act in this life would be to spit in the face of the laws of the country I love, or to condemn myself to eternal damnation for the sin of disrespecting the gift God gave to me.

"One time, upon hearing my dilemma, a friend told me of an arrangement of sorts that had been established at this retirement home. I am still not entirely clear how it came about, but somehow, sometime after the state's doctor-assisted suicide bill was rejected in the state legislature, this came to be known amongst seniors as the place to go for help dying.

"I don't know how this came about, but I do know that the staff has very intentionally turned a blind eye to your actions here, and the residents are all aware of what you do. In fact, it is why many of them are here, or so I have been told. Many of them are merely settling affairs before they signal to you that they wish their time to end. I do not know why this requires a vulgar display of urinating on the floor, but after three years of constant pain, I must admit I was willing to try any crazy suggestion.

"However, I could not in good conscience allow you to go on being exploited in this way. In my years of service, I learned how to spot the men who were doing what they believed in, and the men who were merely following orders. I could see in your eyes when you reassured me after my 'accident' that you despised what I did every bit as much as I despised doing it, and this led me to believe that you were perhaps unaware what was going on here.

"I have spent my entire military career fighting to do right not only by my country, but by the men who served under me. I have fought to ensure that no man serving under me ever died in vain, or served a cause that was false. In my opinion, nothing a nation can do to a soldier is so cowardly and despicable as sending him to kill based on a lie. And by the same measure, I feel it is atrocious that anyone could use you in such a way without your knowledge.

"Having said this, I have wished for death for far too long. My god and my nation may frown on suicide, but I scarcely care anymore. If nothing else, perhaps you acting for me in this regard will absolve me of some measure of guilt. And when you are done, I hope that this letter will signal to you the deception of those around you, so that you may truly choose how to move forward."

"I apologize if I attack you in the execution of your task. I hope that my well-disciplined mind will be able to overcome the reflexes of my well-disciplined body, but if I fail to keep myself from striking you, I am truly sorry.

"Godspeed to you, Mister Shawn Everett Anderson, and may whatever path you take from this day forward be one of purpose and honor. Signed, Commander Willard Macarthy."

I didn't know what to think. I didn't know how to feel. For the first time, I felt guilty about the blood on my hands. All this time, I was apparently their savior, and I couldn't have felt more ashamed of myself.

#### [WP] Your son's recurrent dreams about a monster have become so intense that you take him to a psychiatrist, who prescribes him a medication. While filling the prescription, you notice that the name of the drug is the same as the name of the monster in your son's dreams.

Score: 1498

"The dream is always the same, doctor. A giant worm that tries to eat away at his brain. He says it tries to dig through his skull," I pointed to the bald patches on Michael's head where he'd torn out his own hair in his sleep trying to fight off the imaginary beast, "And through his nose and mouth." His face was covered in jagged scratches and scabs from clawing at the monster. "He can't take it anymore. We've tried all sorts of sleep aids and drugs, but nothing has worked. Isn't there anything you can do?" I thrust the list of everything we had tried into his hand, and he read it over.

He sighed, then reached for a book on a nearby shelf and flipped through the pages. The doctor stopped at one page, looked up at my son twitching and fidgeting on the table, and went back to searching. Eight years old, and already a nervous wreck. "This is a fairly extreme case, and you're right that it is a danger to his health. I will need to keep seeing him regularly in order to determine the cause. In the meantime, there is a drug that I think could help. It's pretty severe, and I'm not sure if it has ever been used on a child before. A colleague of mine at the university is in charge of the trials, and I'm going to give him a call right away to see if your son would be eligible. I have to warn you, though: as with any drug, especially experimental ones, there are risks." 

I bit my lip and looked back down. Michael's sunken eyes looked up at me, full of pain. His eyelids were constantly drooping, threatening to send him back to that hellish nightmare.

"We have to try it," I told him. He nodded, and headed out of the exam room to call his friend.

"You hear that, Michael? The doctor said he has a way to make the nightmares go away!"

Michael looked back up at me without even a smile. He'd heard that promise too many times to be excited about it. All I could do was hug him close.  

----

"The monster won't bother you anymore," I told him, softly petting what little hair he had left. "The doctor gave us these pills that are going to make him go away forever, OK?

He nodded, clutching at my waist. His pajamas were ragged after only two months; we'd had to wash them nearly every day to get rid of the sweat and urine. My husband and I had even bought rubber sheets for our own bed, because he could no longer sleep alone. These dreams had taken a toll on our whole family, and tonight it would finally be over.

"You're sure he won't come back?" Michael whimpered. We sat on the edge of his little mattress, but he refused to get under the blankets. 

"Absolutely sure," I told him. "You heard the doctor."

Michael was silent for a moment, then held out his hand. He'd been given so many drugs to help him sleep over the past few months that he was used to the routine now. I pulled the small orange bottle from my pocket and twisted the cap off. 

"One capsule nightly..." I read from the label. But my eyes strayed upward to the name of the drug: Halidoral. The same word that I'd heard Michael moaning and screaming every night as he thrashed around in the blankets. The name of his giant worm monster.

"What's wrong?" Michael asked.

I stared at the bottle, then looked down into Michael's eyes. For the first time in who knows how long, he actually looked hopefully. 

"Nothing, honey," I managed to stammer. His little hand was still waiting expectantly for the pill.

*It eats my brain,* I remembered him sobbing the first time he told me about the nightmare. *Its name is Halidoral, and it says it won't stop until it eats everything I know and I have no more brain.* We'd reassured him, just like any parent would, that monsters aren't real and that nothing was trying to devour his brain.

*Just a coincidence,* I told myself. *He probably heard the name of the drug in a commercial or something and worked that into his nightmare.*

*It's still experimental,* the other half of my brain argued. *There are no commercials for this drug. How could he have known*?

I looked back down at him. Fear was starting to creep back into his eyes as he waited for me to give him the dosage. "Is everything OK?" he asked in that scared, quivering tone that had replaced his normally light and playful voice.

"Everything's OK, Michael." I shook one of the pills from the bottle and handed it to him. *It's not going to do anything to his brain,* I reassured myself. *The lack of sleep will, though. He needs this.*

He swallowed it obediently, then climbed back into bed. I kissed him goodnight and then flicked off the lights. *Everything will be OK*, I told myself again.

"Goodbye, Mommy," he said softly as he settled into his pillow.

**Ten things God needs you to do RIGHT NOW (the 8th might surprise you)**

1 – Don't cheat on him.

*Come on, you have your God. He's nice to you. You like him. Don't mess this up by sticking a bunch of other Gods in the middle of the relationship. You're not Taylor Swift. Pick a God and stick with it.*

2 – Forget your idols.

*Relax, you can keep listening to your favorite singers. Just get their posters off the wall and stick a cross in their place. We don't want the folks in heaven thinking you love Lorde more than you love the Lord.*

3 – Oh na na, what's my name?

*That's right, God is not Rihanna, constantly asking you for his name. He knows he is called God, you don't need to remind him. So don't use the name unless you reallyyyy really have to.*

4 – Lazy Sundays

*That's the easy one on the list. Just kick back and tell your boss you can't make it on the weekend. It's called God's day, but, really? We all know Sunday is daytime drinking day. Enjoy it.*

5 – Be cool with your parents

*A bit of a hard one for the rebel teenagers out there, but try to keep it together: God, as the father of us all, is kindly asking that we don't be jerks to the people who put food (and money) on our table.*

6 – Don't kill people!

*Yeah, well... Pretty straight forward.*

7 – Don't cheat.

*Ok, you're not allowed to be Taylor Swift, but you're also not allowed to be Kristen Stewart, deal? Break up with the boy, if things are so bad you're considering stepping out of line – and being punished by burning in the eternal fire for it.*

8 – Don't steal.

*Sorry, Reddit.*

9 – Don't lie!

I stared at the 404. "Fix it?" I said, numbly.

"Your mother says you're ever so good at this sort of thing."

"This sort of thing..." someone was saying through my mouth. "Yes, thanks. A cup of tea would be great."

I turned it off. I turned it on.

Yeah. That wasn't helping.

She bustled into the room, genial and warm. "Oh, I don't know," she said dismissively. "I was just pressing buttons. Raspberry Jelly or just butter?"

"Surprise me," I said. "You're *really* good at that."

She beamed and left the room. I turned back to the computer. I wondered if turning it off and -

She brought me toast and tea. I took it gratefully. "Of course I do. You're always telling me about pressing buttons and things. Don't you have one of those microphones that wraps around your head?"

"I do," I said, "I do... have one of those. But -"

"Oh, it's all space age to me," she said as I took a sip of tea."Microphones on your head. We didn't have microphones in my day."

I pulled the tea away from my lips. "Well, you *did*," I said.

#### [EU] Welcome to Walt Disney's Hunger Games, pitting all your favorite Disney characters under 18 years old against one another in a fight to the death. And may the odds be ever in your favor.

Score: 1484

The list of rules got longer every day.

Rule One: you *never* went near a stream deeper than three feet. 

I grit my teeth and remembered: the flash of red hair and the whirlpool death-roll, and the sight of Belle disappearing under carmine bubbles.

*Shudder.*

Rule Two: if you hear songs and echoes, *run*.

*I’m wishing—I’m wishing—for the ones I hate*

*to find me—to find me—tonight…*

*I’m hoping—I’m hoping—*

*And I’m dreaming of*

*The cruel ways,*

*in which they…*

*will die.*

The stampeding horde of wild beasts left only blood and pounded mud where there once was a Simba. At the end he closed his eyes and lifted his head like a king, the lion’s pride as strong as his father’s. 

Rule Three: if you ever see a tree clawed by bears, leave that forest and never return.

Pocahontas was found with three arrows through the heart and two through the eyes, with evidence of a mauling by what looked to be three bear cubs. Stepping under the shadow of a tree with that archer on watch meant instant death and a grave in the guts of her beasts. 

Rules upon rules upon rules. Unnaturally cold? Run. Heavy footfalls of a greek god? *Run.* The bloodcurdling war cry of the wild man? *RUN!* 

Thankfully, if there was one thing I could do well, it was running.

You didn’t live long in the gutter-slums of Agrabah if you were slow. 

***

“I sense him. He’s somewhere close.”

My eyes flashed open and I nearly fell free from my tree-top hammock. There was a shuffling of people far below. 

“Are you sure it isn’t some echo? How can you trust what your senses are telling you… in a place as confused as this?”

“I can feel him, like a blade cutting through fog.”

*They were looking for me.*

My heart clacked up to my throat and I swallowed it down, slowly creeping from my hammock.

“Did you hear that?”

I held perfectly still. The sweat beaded on my face.

“There’s so much life here. I cannot tell the life apart from life. He could be hiding anywhere…”

Life from life. I could hide in the trees, among the animals. I just needed to be quiet, and maybe I could…

There was a tap on my shoulder. “Hey there.”

“Ah!” I screamed and went tumbling out of the branches, grabbing hold of a twig, breaking it in my hands, and then hurtling towards the ground faster than Genie could snap a wish come true.

This was it. I’d had enough close calls in the past to know when it was time to pack it in, and in that crystal moment from branch to the ground I sent out my undying love for Jasmine and accepted that my soul would leave my—

I opened my eyes. I was floating.

I had seen many strange things in this battlefield, but this was by far the strangest. Two girls in pale tunics, with palms up and eyes caught in serene meditation.

“Don’t be afraid of us.”

And in that moment I wasn’t. From above me a figure leapt the ten stories to the ground as if it were a hop over a pond, landing without a sound. 

One of the girls stepped closer. “Can you feel it…?”

Invisible tendrils pulled at my body, and they grew from my heart to theirs in brilliant blooming branches that bound us together.

“I can feel *something,*” I said. 

“You’re special, like us.” The boy from the tree was speaking now. “You can feel the Force.” 

***

It was like waking up for the first time.

The three of them sat me down and told me to erase myself, and I didn’t know what that meant. They said to feel as if the doors to the world were opening inside my head, and that was a picture I could hold onto.

I thought of the door, buried in the sand of my thoughts and memories, made of huge and ancient stone, larger than anything I had ever known, waiting for the right words, the right key.

*Open Sesame, Open Sesame, Open Sesame!*

And I felt it. 

Light poured in through the door and I could feel that life, that joy, that brilliance. I could trace their rays from face to face, from the trees, from the ground under my feet. Lovely, living, breathing *life.* It was a gulp of cool water, a breeze of fresh air, the feel of Jasmine’s hair, and it was spinning a web between me and all that I knew to exist—and beyond.

I opened my eyes to see three knowing smiles. “Who are you?”

“We are padawans,” they said, expecting me to take some meaning from that. “We disappeared from our Temple and awoke on this planet, a part of this horrid game. All three of us sensed a master here, and we came to seek one out. Instead we found… you.”

The boy extended a hand, “My name is Zanishi Das.”

The girl, “And I’m Ayla Sabot.” 

The other, “Call me Shaak-Yu.” 

I gently nudged them through the web of life, sending golden ripples with my soul. “What is this?”

“It’s the Force! A field that comes out of all life, connecting us. Bonding us.” 

It felt like the first time I saw Jasmine in her palace. “It’s love, then?”

“In a manner of speaking.” Das lifted a rock without touching it. “And it is also a living thing, with its own wills, and its own powers. We can teach you, you know.”

“Teach me?”

Shaak-Yu shrugged. “Well, we’re just students ourselves, but there are no better lessons than in the act of teaching, I think!”

I pulsed a will for the soil to lift around my feet, and it came up in a black cloud. “Teach me.” 

***

In a matter of hours I had learned to blot out the crudeness of my senses, feeling only with the Force, feeling only with what really mattered.

My whole life I had been looking out of a pot made of soft clay—and only now could I gently pull it apart and open myself to world as it truly was. 

And what I felt was chaos to the east. A stampede all wrapped up in one beast, with many limbs and a slobbering jaw, and a heart with a splinter that felt like heartache. 

“Do you sense that?” 

I gulped and focused on that deep black splinter. “What is that?”

The padawans picked at their tunics uncomfortably. “That is what the Dark Side feels like.”

Before they could explain, the monster ripped out of the forest and saw us, eyes wide and angry. 

For a moment I thought I glimpsed a hint of intelligence or awareness there, under the folds of purple fur, but they disappeared as he roared at us and charged.

Shaak-Yu whispered to me, “Run,” and then she was bashed into a tree-trunk with muscled arm—just one of six limbs—and my heart stopped. 

I could feel a mind, there.

*Calm,* I said, speaking through the Force—or perhaps letting the Force speak through me.

The thing’s ears twitched and it turned to me with a furrowed brow and bared teeth. A growl rumbled from his throat like thunder on the horizon, dangerous, deep, and sorely sorely angry. 

*Calm.* And then I thought of Jasmine’s tiger Raja, how I played with him and laid upon his striped and soft fur, how I loved him even though he was a sharp-toothed beast, how even though he was a hunter and universally reviled, I learned to make him my family.

*Calm,* I said, and pulsed him feelings of love and belonging. Of how he didn’t have to be angry, or feel so broken and hated inside—not when even one person was ready and willing to welcome him with open arms, regardless of his past.

*Calm,* I said, and the creature folded away his extra arms and sat on his haunches.

“Hello,” I said. “My name is Aladdin.”

Behind me the padawans hefted bright and glowing blades, their faces in awe. I told them to put away their arms and the blues and greens disappeared with the click of a magic button.

The purple beast looked at me with big liquid eyes. “Hello. My name Stitch. You are family?”

*Yes.*

***

Our malevolent hosts had called this field the site of the Hunger Games, and there was insight in that name. Though none of us lacked for food—the forest was plentiful—we were hungry, so hungry, for companionship.

To know the person to your left could kill you as easily as he could say hello was complete and utter loneliness. I knew this, deep down. And Stitch *showed* me. He was angry and violent—but I knew all creatures would feel such when put into such dire straits. 

I brooked deals. I held talks. 

One by one, I broke all my rules.

***

I wandered near a stream, and I felt the red-hair’s claws wrap around my legs and dig deep under the skin. As I bled I reached out and said, *Calm.*

Her brow flattened and her eyes went wide. “We aren’t here to hurt you,” said Ayla Sabot.

The padawan stepped down to the riverbank and handed the mermaid her glittering silver hilt. “I know you are curious, and trusting. And being in this place has made you violent. But we are friends. And we have gifts.”

Ariel ignited the blade and gasped in delight. She looked up at us with a smile. “Friends.”

***

I followed the song and its echoes.

*…cruel ways, in which they, will die!*

Stitch snorted as the animals crawled out of the long grass, but together the padawans and I held out our hands and calmed their troubled, slaved souls. We followed them to their queen, a pale girl under an apple tree, with tangled hair and mad eyes. 

She grimaced at us and sang high, bidding the animals do her killing. 

I searched her mind and found it broken, fractured. She was no longer sane. 

*Calm,* I told her, and she collapsed into a fit of tears and babbling. I held her close, knowing she would never be whole again. *Calm.* 

***

I caught arrows in mid-flight, and spoke with Merida and her brother bears. I found the wild man Tarzan and showed him how to speak. I found the queen of the frost fields, the god of strength in his house of bones, the ravenous Mad Mice of the southern warrens.

And I told them all, *Calm.*

We are now fifty strong, and we know who put us here.

We look to them now, and we march.

The people who put us here took me away from Jasmine, and they made me taste what heartache was. I feel it like a splinter, gnawing at my heart. The padawans can't sense it, but I know it's there: deep and dark, as sharp as black lightning on a red sky. 

When we find the people who did this, I can’t be sure just how long this *Calm* will last.

#### [WP] It's the coldest Christmas Eve in history, and a poor family is out of coal for the furnace. The only child in the family has 24 hours to get on the naughty list.

Score: 1483

Father blew into his hands then clapped and rubbed them together to keep them warm in his thin woolen gloves. Mother wrapped another threadbare blanket tight around her shoulders. My breath steamed in front of my face.

“You’ve got to do it,” said Father. His words came out in a chattering, halting pace. 

Mother looked towards the cold stove. It hadn’t been lit in three days. We’d made due with hot soup warmed over a small propane camping stove, but Kyle had been caught stealing propane tanks. At least he’d be warm in lockup before he was sent off to the work camps. 

“There’s no other way,” said Mother. Her face was pale from the cold, a small amount of snot frozen around the edges of her nostrils.

I shook my head. Tears stung my eyes. They felt like they were freezing as soon as they hit the air. “I can’t do it.” I gave a quick glance to April who sat in the chair opposite where I stood. “I won’t do it.”

Father pulled a small towel wrapped bundle from his coat pocket and pressed it into my hands. “I know you’re only twelve, Brad, but you’re the only one that can do it.”

“No,” I whispered. I wanted to drop the bundle and run away but fear, and the cold, kept me rooted in place. 

“Christmas will be in ten –“ Mother’s coughing fit prevented her from finishing. 

Father rubbed her back while he stared at me. “Christmas is in ten minutes. You have to do something big, something bad, to get on Santa’s Naughty List.”

I was the youngest and the only one who still got presents from Santa. “No,” I said.

April fell forward off her chair. Her toothpick like legs couldn’t support her anymore, so she dragged herself across the room, her thin boots scuffing against the warped wooden floor of our studio apartment. My parents averted their gaze.  “Please, Brad.” She grabbed my wrist with an icy grip that had strength I didn’t know she still possessed.

I shook my head and closed my eyes.

“Please, Brad,” whispered April. “I know what I’m asking you to do.” She pulled the towel away from the bundle. It held a snub nose .22 revolver. “Please, Brad.”

My whimpering was the loudest sound in the room.  “No.” My sniffles echoed off the walls.

April glanced at the wall clock. She bit her bottom lip and put the gun barrel under her chin. “Do it, Brad. There are only a few minutes left.”

“No.”

“If you don’t we’re all going to freeze,” April whispered. Tears rolled down her pale cheeks. “Do it, Brad.”

“No.”

Father walked up behind me and slammed his fist into the small of my back. Pain and surprise flooded me, and I jumped.

The gun went off.

We stayed warm through the winter with coal to spare.

"So, Grandma! Tell me stories from when you were my age!" I said, trying to act excited. She always told me the same three stories when I visited her, but it made her happy.

"Well, you see, Tom-"

She was cut off by the scream of a man who'd entered the wrong octave. Glass shattered, wood splintered and men in black armor surrounded us.

"Get on the ground!" they screamed, pointing guns at us. *This is it. Terrorists have come to kill us all.*

We were handcuffed and told to sit on a couch, then approached by a fairly handsome man in his thirties.

"Well," he said, standing in front of us, "you two are not what I expected to find here."

I was crying at that point, but grandma was....grandma. 

"Would you like some tea, dear? Oh, my, it's been so long since I've had new visitors. Tommy, are these your friends?"

"No, ma'am. I'm with the FBI. We're here because somebody broke into our database, accessing very sensitive information about classified operations."

I was still crying, looking at him with bewilderment. "I'm just here to visit my grandma!"

He turned to her. "Well, ma'am? You know what we're talking about?"

"I'm afraid not, deary. Though today I did have a bit of trouble getting the Googles on my computer. I wanted to find recipes, but I can never find the damn Googles. Also, let me just say- it's nice that they let a colored man work for the FBI. I think society has come a long way."

He stared at her, squinting his eyes and glossing over the last bit. "The Googles? You mean Google, the search engine?"

"Yes, sweetie, I suppose so. I clicked on the colorful circle thingy, then tried to type 'thegoogles.com' but that didn't work, so I typed in 'fbi.com' and your website came up. I thought you might have the Googles on your page thingy- I mean, you guys are good at finding things, right? But no matter what I clicked on, I couldn't find it. Then something asked for my nickname and password, so I tried to log on a few times but I can never remember my password. I put the name '1234' and the password 'password' in like I'm supposed to, but it didn't work. So I tried 'Password' with a capital P, and then I found all kinds of really neat things, but no Googles and I gave up."

The man stared blankly at her, like she was some sort of alien. I butted in. "Please, she has no idea what she's doing. I had to teach her how to plug the computer in and push the on button. There's no malice here!"

His eyes remained fixated on her. "You're saying the password was 'Password' and the username was '1234'?"

"Yes, that's all I could remember. Are we in trouble, young man?"

He stood up, pinching the bridge of his nose. "No, you're not. But there's a lazy network engineer that's going to have a nice vacation in Guantanamo Bay."

"It's a blessing and a curse," I said. I don't like talking about it. Especially in public, and this diner is not secluded enough.

"Come on, it's got to be the coolest thing ever." She smiled at me, eyes lit up. She's beautiful. It pains me.

"No," I said. "It hurts people. Sure it feels satisfying in the moment but... I don't like it."

She paused, suspicious. 

"Try me." she said. 

"No." God, no.

"Come on, try me. If you can." She smiled mischievously.

"No, it's just hurtful. I don't want to do this. Especially with you."

"Well maybe you don't actually know what to say, you're all talk." She laughed and playfully threw a napkin at me.

I sighed. This has ended so many relationships.

"Please, let's just change subjects." I pleaded.

"Tell me!" she said. Her smile had faded a bit. She was serious.

After a long moment, I dropped my shoulders.

"Okay," I said. She sat back and settled into the booth, expectantly.

I studied her for a long time. Her hair was a gorgeous golden blonde. She had radiant green eyes. Her face was almost symmetrical, except for the slight tilt in her grin. Her neck was slender, and her shoulders soft but proud. Her sweater fit over her chest snug enough to accentuate her curves, but not put them on display. She was beautiful, and knew it, but didn't use it. 

I had known her for two years. I had met her parents, and her half-sister from her mother's previous marriage. We had mutual friends. There wasn't much about her that one could use against her, she was very self confident, aware of her limitations, and loved herself in a way that made most people envious.

For people like this, honesty was usually the best policy.

"I don't love you." I said. A crack in someone's worldview is much more efficient than shattering their self-perception.

She furrowed her brow, looking confused, annoyed almost. She let out a breath that may have been laughter, or disbelief.

"What?" she said. "That's it? That's not funny, or true."

There it was. The crack. She had to say it out loud. I shrugged.

"Okay," I said. "I told you I didn't want to do this."

We ate mostly silently for the next hour. She would comment on her work and I would listen. We finished our meal, I paid, and we left the diner.

As we walked to her car, she took my hand in hers. I glanced over, and saw tears streaming down her cheeks.

I have the best boobs in the world.

I'm not, like, egotistical or anything. Heck, some days I don't even want them, but it's undeniable. That was my mutation. April 24th, 2014, the day I developed the best pair of breasts anyone has ever had.

At first, I was actually a little stoked. I mean, my rack is *amazing*. It doesn't matter what I'm wearing, they look good. They fill t-shirts out wonderfully, and even in sweaters and jackets the gentle curves show just right, enticing the viewer and leaving them wanting more. And tank tops? Forget about it.

And sure, I do get treated different. I can go just about anywhere these days, and any guy is willing to pretend to be interested in what I have to say – even a lot of women I meet will at least give me a second glance, if not special treatment. I certainly have my pick of the litter when it comes to sexual partners, and let me tell you: I am *enjoy*ing my youth.

Don't get me wrong, though, there are downsides. Just about *everyone* stares. It's hard to really engage someone in conversation. I've seen grown men cry from the effort of maintaining eye contact with me. And the starers, the criers, they're the good ones. I can't ride the subway without being felt up, I don't dare be alone at night without people I trust, many women openly resent me, and all of this is seen as normal. I'm just the Great Tits, as if nobody's even expected to *try* to maintain decorum around me.

But you know none of this is even the worst aspect, not really. More than any of this, there's one thing about my boobs that keeps me up at night, one thing that makes me worry about how the rest of my life is going to play out.

Even with my beard, nobody will believe I'm a guy.

#### [WP] Main character breaks the fourth wall. Then it breaks back. Hard.

Score: 1472

It's been years since I made the wish.  Since I saw the shooting star streaking across the sky, the night after twelve rejection letters came in the mail for my new novel.  I still remember the words in those letters, so impersonally devoid of emotion that they stung.

*Characters lack rationality, emotion.  Unbelievable in their actions.  Missing a human element.*

So that night, I made my wish.  As the star soared overhead, I whispered, and my voice was caught by the wind and whisked into the sky.

"I wish I could breathe life into my characters."

I had not meant that wish literally, but that's how fate interpreted it.

The next day I started a new novel, the words flowing from my pen like water from a river.  New lines appeared before the ink dried, dialogue flowing back and forth like it never had before.  In my mind I met my characters.  Their personalities became as real as my own, their tics and flaws so natural that they became closer than my actual friends.  I knew  them, and I loved them.  Especially Jeremy, my main character, a hero worthy of any legend.

I wrote that novel in three months, faster than any other I had tried before.  I turned in my first draft- even after thorough inspection, there were no errors I could detect.  

Three weeks after sending the novel to my choice publisher, I received a call.

"May I speak with Curt Anderson?"

"Speaking."

"Curt Anderson, we have reviewed your novel and fallen in love with it.  Would you be interested in moving to the next step?"

With those simple words, my lifelong dream came to fruition.  In a year my novel reached the best seller list, and the publishing company began asking for a sequel.

Which is when the implications of my wish began.

The sequel poured out of me with faster speed than the first, and as I wrote, I felt Jeremy slipping out of his role as hero.  He seemed to doubt himself, acting with indecision where he would once take action.  Soon he began questioning the life around him, brooding, and became obsessed with a scratching noise that would keep him awake long hours into the night.

Until, one day, in the middle of dialogue with the villain, he broke character.

"I can hear your pen scratching, Curt.  Why did you create me?"

I stopped writing, my pen dug into the page.  Then I heard his voice in my mind, as vivid as on the page.

"I'm not real, am I, Curt?"

"No." I said, the words catching in my mouth.

"Then finish me off.  There's no reason for me to carry on."

I wrote through the night, wrapping up the sequel.  In a strange turn of events, Jeremy won the lottery, and spent the rest of his life in the caribbean.  With a thick stroke, I scratched in "THE END" to the end of the page, and I felt his voice depart from my mind.

After a year I started writing another novel, hoping that the first had been some strange trick of the mind.  Maybe I should be looked at for a mental illness.  But I did not feel crazy, so I kept writing.

Jasmine, my new character, caught on quicker than Jeremy.  Nearly three quarters into the novel, she addressed me, asking me how I could have ever killed her mother in a car crash forty pages back.  Without hesitation, I wrote in that Jasmine met the man of her dreams, they moved to the Bahamas, where she met her true mother because she had been adopted.  Then I slammed the book shut, another "THE END" scratched into the final page.

The realization occurred in my next work.  And the work after that.  As my writing became more practiced, even minor characters started noticing that their lives were fake.  Some committed suicide, some went crazy, but I saved as many as possible by writing in some turn of events that made their lives happier.

On my fifteenth book, I had not yet finished the first chapter, when my character addressed me by name.  That day I was in a coffee shop, and I felt something snap in my brain.

Despite the score of people drinking around me, I pushed my chair back, stood, and yelled towards the ceiling.

"Why is the happening to me?  How is this happening to me?  Why did you put this into my life?  Why did you *write* this into my life?"

The other customers stared at me, confused as I was by my outburst.  Behind the counter, I saw the barista start dialing on a cell phone, and knew she was either calling for the police or her manager.  I stormed out of the building and drove home, speeding along the way and considering ramming myself into a tree.

But two gentlemen waited for me in my front yard, holding a giant check.

"What's this?" I asked, opening my door.

"Why it's for you, Curt.  You won a sweepstakes.  Congratulations! Several million dollars worth, and a home in tropical paradise."

"What sweepstakes?"

The man smiled, shook my hand, then leaned in to whisper in my ear.

"Mr. Jacobs says you deserve this.  You don't know him, but he knows you.  He knows all of us in fact."  The man in the suit waved about him, gesturing at the world in general, "But he does have one stipulation- you will never write again.  And he will never write about you again."  

On the subject line of the check, there were only two words.

"THE END"

#### [WP] Describe a battle with an army against a single man..... Except that man is a level 20 D&D character.

Score: 1471

"Lancelot! What news bring ye from the front?"  

"Naught but tragedy, sire."  

"What? Didst we not meeteth the solitary man with six divisions of our finest cavalry?"  

"Verily, Highness, but the foulsome knave hath-- okay, I can't do this. Can we talk normally?"  

The king glared at him for a moment.  

"Fine," he said, waving away the cameramen from *Real Monarchs of Camelot*, who were filming their season finale. "Get out of here! Let me speak to my man in peace!"  

Lancelot rubbed his jaw as the production crew filed sullenly out the throne room's gilded doors.    

"So," said the king when they were alone, settling atop his throne, "what the flying fuck happened out there?"  

"He turned our cavalry to pudding, sir. All six divisions."  

"Is that a metaphor? If so, ew."  

"No, sir. Literal pudding."  

"Jesus," said the king, removing his crown to scratch at a sweaty bald spot. "That can't possibly be in the rulebook."  

"Our greatest scholars are consulting the ancient texts and the Internet forums as we speak, sire."  

"You said he was a *Bard?*"  

"He appears to be a hybrid of several classes, sir. Bard, Barbarian, and something he calls 'Apocalypse Buttstabber.'"  

"That's not -- he can't make up his own class! That's cheating!"  

"He's fourteen feet tall, sir. He beat our strongest champion in single combat by slapping him around with his -- with his -- I mean, his tumescent lance-type organ, if you-- "  

"I get it, I get it, Jesus," said the king. "So what does he want?"  

"Nobody knows. He appears to be rampaging across the countryside out of pure boredom. The scholars hypothesize that he maxed out his level and ran out of quests that challenged him."  

"The real criminal here," said the king, "is the dungeon master who allowed him to reach such preposterous heights."  

Lancelot sprang to his feet. 

"That's it, sire!" he shouted. "Why didn't I think of it before?"  

"What?" cried the king, waddling after Lancelot as the knight dashed across the throne room, tugging his helmet on as he went.  

"That's the secret," said Lancelot, his voice muffled behind the steely mask. "Forget the man -- it's the power behind the throne that must be dealt with!"  

*****  
*****   

In a dank and distant basement, many-sided dice clattered against the confines of their plastic box.  

"I'm bored," said Bradley, flicking miniatures off the table. "Gimme another power."  

Greg glared at him. "I just gave you telekinesis and flight. What more do you want?"  

"I don't know, man," said Bradley. "I'm bored as shit."  

"God," said Greg, "you make this dungeon master thing so frikking hard, you know?"  

Bradley sniffed the air.  

"Hey," he said, "do you smell smoke?"  

They ran to the stairs. Standing in the doorway at the top, holding a torch the diameter of a pencil, was a tiny man in armor.  

"BURN IN HELL, NERDS!" squeaked the man in armor, flinging the torch down the stairs.  

It bounced three times, sputtered, and went out.  

"Um," said Bradley.  

"Stay right there," said the tiny man, and ran off into the kitchen in search of something more flammable.

#### [WP] You are a part of the middle generation on a colony ship. You never saw Earth and will not see your destination.

Score: 1462

She smiles, her slender fingers tracing the indents on the clear plastic as smooth as glass. Dots of white arhosa mark the window in what could only be assumed as disarray, carved in by the point of a pen. Almost a year ago they were made, and in a year they'll be a new array, each point carefully calculated and marked.

"Feels nice, doesn't it?" I say, rising from my bed beside her. She laughs as I kiss from her shoulder to her neck, before brushing me away.

"Stop tickling me, would you?"

Before I can say anything a meteor whizzes past the hull, flanked a stream of technicolor particles illuminated by year old sunlight. 

"Whoa," she exclaims, twisting her head around to see it pass by.

"How can you still get excited about that sort of stuff?"

"Because after 20 years it's still incredible."

Again, I'm lost behind her awe of space. The planets, the power, the destination, the mission: it's consumed her since birth. Being the only daughter of the head pilot, it's only expected. I don't know why I anticipated anything different after a night together in her room. Again, I try to wrestle away her attention.

"So what are the dots?" I ask, rousing her attention back from the stars.

"Huh?"

Wrapping my arm around her waist I pull myself beside her and grab her open hand. Taking her finger, I trace it against the little white specs on her bedroom window. 

"What constellation is it?"

She arcs her head back and belts out a echoing laugh. I blush within seconds, doubting what I assumed was obvious. Now sympathetic, she rubs my bare knee.

"I'm sorry. It's not any constellation, which you had no way of knowing. I mean, there are *so* many constellations after all. But you were pretty close."


"Close how?"

Always the teacher, she withholds the answer a bit more. 


"Wrong formation, but the correct bodies."

"Suns."

She inches her hand up my leg. "Correct."

Oh, so it's this sort of game.

"But it isn't a constellation?"

She presses her hand down, but moves it nowhere.

"I mean, *technically*, I guess, but it doesn't have a name."

I grab her hand and move it up an inch for her.

"So, I was correct."

"But what is it a constellation of?"

Twenty-four suns in white twinkle across the canvas of her bedroom window. Twisting my head, I search for some pattern and shape. While none of them are clustered together, a few are at the far corners, distinct from the rest. No image emerges from the points.

She scoots herself up, and moves to the head of the bed to face me. 

"Whoa, hold on I haven't given up."

Laughing, she smacks the indent from her old seat, motioning me to move. When I do she advises me to lean back, turn left, turn right, stare straight, until suddenly I see the stars line up an inch off from the  markings on her window. 

"I made them 10 months ago, and despite the fact we're barreling forward and hundreds of thousands of miles per hour, from this point they haven't moved a distance longer than my finger."

"That's depressing."

"No it's not. It's beautiful. People are so quick to complain on this ship about the trip. They talk about earth as if they've seen it, as if they're leaving some fantastic place behind, but it's all perspective. Good, bad, near, far, pain, pleasure, it's relative. So why not hold onto the belief that our lives here are beautiful, that we're fortunate to be here."

With her bare finger, she rubs a lone star on the corner of the window. 

"Why would anyone be distant when there is so much love, so close?"

"I think she likes ya." Lucifer observed.

We sat on the picnic bench eating our hot dogs while watching the girls playing volleyball.

"Cindy? Her, no.... come on... no..." I said.

"She asked you to come down here and watch her play... BEACH... VOLLEY... BALL. You do not have to be older than humanity to know what's going on." Lucifer explained.

"She just wants me to do her homework, she knows i'm finishing my thesis in a few months and wants to squeeze me for one more paper before i go." I replied.

"Why do you have such a low opinion of people?" Lucifer asked.

"Why do YOU have such a high opinion of people?" I retorted.

He smiled and broke into a hearty laugh. 

"Lot's of experience my friend. But how about this, say you don't have time to do a full paper for her, but you recently won a couple of tickets for a movie and you want her to come with you one last time before finals begin in two weeks." Lucifer explained.

"But i don't have tickets!"

With a flick of his risk he seemed to pull them out of thin air.

"You do now. And if you act now in the next ten seconds, i'll even throw in this concession coupon." Lucifer smiled.

"Well...." I hesitated

"9...8....7...."

I grabbed the tickets and ran up to Cindy while Lucifer smiled and continued eating his hot dog. Cindy seemed disappointed that i couldn't do her homework, but perked up when i offered to take her to the movies. 

"How did you know?" I asked as i sat back down on the bench, "You're not messing with her head are you?"

He laughed again, "When you sold your soul at 6 years old you asked for a good friend, you did not ask to mess with free will. But more importantly, i don't have to mess with free will to help you out. You're not that pathetic!"

"Easy for you to say, you're evil incarnate!" I joked.

He let out a roar of laughter and almost choked on his hot dog. But before he could reply, his cellphone beeped an incoming text. He didn't actually need a phone, but he manifested one so I could feel more comfortable when he did his work.

"Another one?" I asked.

"Another one, I have to do this one myself, definitely not something i can offload onto an underling." He explained as he got up and tossed the rest of his uneaten hot dog into the trash. "Give me a ring after the movie and let me know how your date goes."

"It's not a da----"

Before i could finish he had already vanished.

#### [EU] The Top Gear gang are in the Harry Potter Universe reviewing brooms. Write a Segment! What do they review? What happens during?

Score: 1461

Tonight! I eat some frogs. James waves a stick. And Richard talks to a man [role clip "Richard talking to Gary Oldman" Audio: "I think I'm really more of a Gryffindor-Ravenclaw hybrid"]

JEREMY: Hello and welcome! to another Top Gear special, and it is a good one

JAMES: Indeed, the producers have sent us here [points vaguely to no particular spot on a map of England] deep in the heart of well, here. Told us to go out and buy us each *an broomstick* for not more than 15 sickles to be taken on a series of *challenges*.

[Aerial montage of Harry Potter landscapes and locales culminating in a slow panning shot from the Hogwarts main bridge to the quidditch field] 

VO JAMES: I was the first to arrive, and as you have come to know about me, I have done it *properly*. 

JAMES: This, viewers, is an *Oakshaft 79*. The original touring broom for the work-a-day wizard home and away, whether near nor far, the Oakshaft is better than a car. A classic as timeless as, well, a vault full of time turners I suppose. Oak body, obviously enough, with a bowtruckle heart core, ash bristles and a top spee--- hang on a minute

[cut to Jeremy flying in on a sparkling gold and black broomstick shooting sparks from its bristles]

JEREMY: **Oh Yes**. Oh Yes.

JAMES: *You UTTER Muggle*, a Comet 140 I presume? Otherwise known as Auror's Bane. Fantastically infamous for their, what was it? Speed and pursuit abilities? no that's not it. Falling out of the sky in a billowing plume of fiery destruction. A bold choice, I admit, but not like to be the sort for whatever the producer's have in mind, surely.

JEREMY: Clearly you haven't the imagination nor cunning to appreciate for my genius. The Comet 140 won the Quidditch world cup in 7 consecutive events over 9 non-consecutive years. And you've brought what an Oakshaft? You think that old Hag-rider will be up for whatever the Producers have lined up? 

JAMES: Hag-rider? The Oakshaft 79 the was broom of choice for the ministry of magic's department of questionable departments for 13 years. There has never been a more stable or reliable mode of transportation, the Oakshaft 79 is *the* workman's broom. All other workman's brooms are irrelevant by comparison.

JEREMY: It's a hag-rider and it's boring and you're a moron. But speaking of morons. Where's that other one?

[Cut to a sudden outcrop of rainclouds moving against the wind towards the pitch dropping sporadic drops of greenish water in an embarrassingly ineffectual spittle, as it nears, beneath it rides the visage of Richard Hammond, grinning widely with self-satisfaction, and wearing a very ungainly wizard's hat and what appears to be a bathrobe]

[Richard comes to a halt dismounts as the rain cloud overhead spits its brackish water onto Jeremy and James who bristle and scowl]

RICHARD Gesticulating happily: A Thunderbolt IV. Thunderbolt! You cannot get a better broom than this it's got

JEREMY: Richard.

RICHARD: -- a top speed of 106.5 mph(nautical), gold inlays and a beetle core. 

JEREMY: Richard.

RICHARD: Ebony wood, and hazel twigs. This is the best of th-

JEREMY: **RICHARD**! I have become wet in the presence of your broom. 

RICHARD: Yeah well there *is* a *slight* issue with an unbreakable *rananimbus* hex. The wizard who sold it to me's *cousin* played for the Nigerian National Team's... divisional development subsection... C and he assures me that this is the genuine, real deal. Joseph Snuka had one of these. Thunderbolt. It's the brand you need. End of discussion. Fact. 

JEREMY: Wet. oh hello

[A Producer wearing a wizarding robe with a lab coat and cargo shorts apparates and produces an envelope she hands to Jeremy]

JEREMY: "Between the floo network, portkeys, apparition and toilet bowls, the Ministry of Magic's department of transportative transfigurables has little room for the traditional broomstick anymore save for playing Quidditch and well... sweeping. To prove them wrong. You are to take your broomsticks and fly from here to Fossvang, Norway along the ancient Warlock Skyway. There, you will take part in a traditional broomstick competition that isn't Quidditch, but that will make you wish it was."

[Richard's eyes widen and his smug grin grows bolder while James and Jeremy look forlornly at their selections] 

RICHARD: Oh this will be a dawdle! Come on chaps. Accio Fossvang! haha! 

[Richard takes to the sky, leaving James and Jeremy to pout over the enormity of the challenge for their worn out and modest older brooms]

"Hey! That's the guy that killed my cousin! Pull over!"

*Here it comes again,* I thought to myself. I turned to face my attacker. The third in as many days. Some punk with a third-rate powerset. Probably born since the District was walled off.

I sized him up. No obvious indicators of his power. Nothing obvious on his clothes to indicate anything either.

"You're nothin'! you hear me!? Nothin'!"

I ignored him and walked closer for a better look. He pulled a gun out of his vest and shot me in the head.

---

"Hey! That's the guy that killed my cousin! Pull over!"

*Gun in the vest, go for that first. Either wants to show off his gun, or his power isn't a combat power.*

"You're noth- huh?" I cut him off as I pulled the gun out of the vest. Biometrically locked. Useless to me. I tossed it aside. I examined his response. Too stupid to be surprised that I knew he had a gun. Not surprising, I suppose. He wound up for a haymaker. I watched for any giveaways. Nothing off about his stance, no glowing motes or strange noises. I braced my self for impact, making no effort to dodge. Predictably, it knocked my head clean off.

---

*Gun in vest, something that acts like super strength, maybe kinetic manipulation?*

"Hey! That's th-" I cut him off with a thrown chunk of debris. No reaction whatsoever.

"You're dead, you piece of shit! I'll fuckin pick my teeth with your bones!" Curious. Altered dietary requirements, or just a threat? I couldn't smell anything odd on his breath, and all his teeth looked standard issue. Probably just a threat.

I go for his gun, just like last time, and throw it away. He winds up for a haymaker, which ends up being too slow to hit me. I take an experimental punch. The relatively light jab does nothing to him, but breaks my arm. *call it kinetic manipulation then.*

His next attack crushes my ribcage.

---

I reset to before his car comes around the corner and look around my environment. There's no such thing as invincible. Honestly, simple immunity to physical harm is one of the least annoying powers to deal with. Someone seemingly invulnerable might be vulnerable to poison, or radiation, or maybe just still needs to breathe. That'll do, right there. If his only power is contact-range crude kinetic manipulation, this can of... aerosol brake cleaner should do the trick. I look on the warning label. It's an older product, which usually means more poisonous. An entire half of the can dedicated to warnings not to ingest or expose to eyes. Good.

"Hey! That's the guy that killed my cousin! Pull over!"

He steps out of the car.

"You're nothin'! you hear me!? Nothin'!"

I duck toward him and retrieve his gun. He grabs for me, an attack I easily dodge. I raise the can to his face and press the trigger. He screams as the chemicals contact his soft tissues. I don't think it'll kill him but... I take an experimental kick at his side as he writhes on the ground. No reaction. Means he needs to be able to concentrate. I drag him over to the edge of the sidewalk while his driver looks on in horror. I take his head and slam his open mouth down on the curb twice. He stops moving.

It's all over too quickly for a real crowd to gather, but the driver and the little old lady crossing the street stare, wide-eyed. I don't think anyone has ever guessed what my power lets me do. Fine by me. They're welcome to keep coming. They'll run out of challengers long before I get tired of destroying them.

#### [WP] In 2025, the mission Mars One is a full success. Upon arrival on the red planet, the astronauts notice some kind of cave, containing a single human skeleton – and four words, carved into a wall.

Score: 1452

Andre Jackson, clumsy in his spacesuit, stumbled out from the cave and up the copper-red ridge, kicking up dust, and at the top found Cmdr. Earl Dorsett frowning inside his helmet.

"What's the matter?" asked Jackson.

"It's just wrong."

"We have no other choice. They're our orders."

"Yeah, well. Orders are complicated."

At first it had been a triumph, to find the fossil in the Martian cave. It justified their eight-month journey through prepackaged orange food and the desolate, horizonless void: the first sign of life on another world. They took samples eagerly, sent them home giddy.

One night, Jackson had hounded Dorsett about all the possibilities. "As far as we know," he had said, "we're the only ones who've ever been here, right? So that means there was an ancient human civilization that achieved spaceflight--"

"And left a man to die?" Dorsett had finished for him. "I don't find this exciting, Jackson. I find it troubling."

Houston did, too. They started acting strange.

It was on their second excursion they saw the message written in the wall. In English, of all languages.

**THE EARTH IS NEXT**

They took photos, sent them home. Houston went silent. Then they had a confidential talk with Cmdr. Dorsett while Jackson waited in the pod outside, and their conclusion was that the cave be destroyed. Jackson had protested--what they saw there, however frightening, was knowledge that belonged to the whole human race. Dorsett agreed, but intimated that the crew's continued survival was at the leisure of NASA. It sent a chill through Jackson's spine.

It was Jackson who fitted the charges in the entrance to the cave. Now he was back for the last charge. Dorsett held the fuse in his hand--a small panel of a few dials and one big red button. Jackson knew what the big red button was for.

"The last one," Jackson said.

"Just put it in," Dorsett said, his voice thick with static through the helmet com. "Just do it."

That was strange. In eight months, Dorsett had never once cracked on the journey there. He was friendly, amiable--enjoyed hearing all about Jackson's family back on earth. It had been reassuring once. Ever since his communication with Houston, that had changed. *He hates this idea just as much as I do,* Jackson figured. 

Jackson was the junior commander here, so he obliged.

Inside the cave, the com didn't work, so he had to find the entrance and wave to Dorsett to wave the fact that they were in all in place. Then it was just a matter of getting up the ridge--

Static came in. Dorsett's helmet was sending something.

"Come again?" Jackson replied.

"I'm sorry, Jackson," Dorsett said through the static.

The charges shuddered and burst, the cave boomed, and Jackson was propelled backwards. Dust fell all around him. The cave went dark, the entrance sealed by the blast. *My leg, my leg,* Jackson thought, and found it, but it was broken. The suit hadn't burst through, thank God.

"Commander!" he shouted through the com. "We've had a failure! Commander!"

No response, save for static.

*No failure,* he realized suddenly. *He meant for those charges to go off. He* killed *me.*

"Commander!" he shouted again. "DORSETT!" He banged on the side of the cave, but it was thick and gave no sound save for the thumping in Jackson's own suit.

*Where am I?* Certainly no part of the cave *he* had ever explored. It was where Dorsett had first traveled, the lone section of cave that jutted off from the main hollow.

There were markings here. Markings Jackson had not seen.

**UNLESS YOU LEAVE MORE FLESH**

He looked at the skeleton at the other end of the cave, lit dimly by the faint blue lights of Jackson's own spacesuit. The skeleton's sockets were hollow and empty, but the teeth were arranged in a pale white grin. Jackson felt his suit vibrate, and realized it was sound, moving through the cave, through his suit itself. It didn't create a pleasant sound in his air supply. It sounded rather like a thousand creatures crawling, and crawling fast.

The radio crackled to life, snapping me from my hypnosis on the waves of endless clouds. "Charlie Unit, report when you make visual contact, over." I confirmed, thrusting the yoke forwards to duck beneath the clouds as my wings sliced a path through them for a moment before I emerged below. 

"Visual with Earth confirmed. She's ugly as ever. Over." The grey landscape made me shudder; mountains and hills steamed with escaping gasses, reminding me to snap on my oxygen tank before the air became too toxic to breathe. What were once luscious forests and deep blue seas were now fossilized wood and empty basins large enough to fit the entire evacuated population a thousand times.  Famine had come first as the food supplies and water ran out. Wars followed as countries jockeyed for power of the limited rations with the traditional powers emerging victorious. But in the end, the celebration of conquests was short-lived as leaders came to grips with reality and realized remaining on Earth meant certain death. That's how we wound up in outer space; searching desperately for a habitable planet as we wandered aimlessly in the barely adequate motherships.

"Steer for 29 dot 9792 north, 31 dot 1342 east. Should see pyramids if they're still above ground. Do you copy?" I confirmed, repeating the numbers back to them, and sped towards the ancient monuments, long since abandoned as the land grew brittle and inhospitable. The pyramids were smaller than I remembered from pictures, courtesy of a thick layer of ash and dirt that had built around their base. The Sphinx peeked out nearby, only its eyes visible now. They stared at me ominously as I touched down; the last living creature to be on our once beautiful planet. The scientists claimed that the Earth's core had grown cold but no proposed solution worked and everything had fallen apart as we watched and warred like savages over the rapidly dwindling supplies.

"Visual contact confirmed. Pyramids are intact. Landing now. Out." I slowly hovered to the ground near the largest pyramid, taking care to touch down on a solid-looking patch. My orders were to only make visual contact but I figured no harm in exploring a bit. I had never had the chance to visit the pyramids while civilization bloomed. An item to cross off my bucket list now, it seemed. Donned in the safe-suit and with the oxygen tank strapped to my back, I grabbed the grapple I had smuggled aboard my craft and started the short but arduous trek towards the pyramid. The world reeked of noxious fumes that found their way to me in spite of the helmet I wore. And death. It smelled of death and looked of death and everything emanated death. I gagged softly before regaining my composure.

The pyramid loomed above me, massive in spite of the portion buried below. With a grin and a habitual glance around for any superiors who might reprimand me, I shot the grapple towards the top of the pyramid and steadily made my way upwards. Ashen winds whipped around me, stirring up vortices of the dust that had dealt death to billions as we scrambled to evacuate. I reached the top short of breath and sweating as the Sun beat down mercilessly on the endless wasteland. Looking out, I could see where the city once stood, only the top of buildings signalling that we had ever even lived here. Morbid and disgusting yet oddly beautiful.

I struggled to catch my breath, awed by the enormity of the emptiness we had left behind. Just a couple years back, the ground below would have been bustling with thousands of tourists as they gaped at the massive structure. Now there was nothing; not even Nature had survived the brutal apocalypse. Leaning back against the apex of the pyramid, I jumped and nearly became Earth's final victim as the top caved inwards, revealing a passageway into the depths of the abandoned monument.

"Base, this is Charlie Unit..." I paused, still struggling to understand what I was seeing.

"We copy, Charlie Unit. Is there an issue? All we needed you to check was that the pyramid was in fact intact. Nothing more. Over." The voice sounded harsh over the intercom, scolding me even as I took in the last of our planet. I shook my head numbly as I cautiously shone my flashlight into the abyss.

"I... I'm at the top of the pyramid," I started slowly, knowing I would be punished for my transgression upon my return to the motherships. "And... Well, the top just opened. There's a passage way into the pyramid... Permission to enter? Over." I stepped inside, knowing permission would be denied but that I had to see where the passageway led, the boy in me urging me to explore. I thought back to my history lessons back when the Earth was friendly and painted blue and green. No teacher had ever mentioned a passageway at the top of the pyramids or even a way to enter the massive structures.

"Permission denied. Abort mission immediately. I repeat, you do not have permission to enter the pyramid. Do you copy?" A tinge of desperation edged the voice as it repeated itself. I scowled and would have spat had my breathing apparatus not prevented me. Ignoring the orders from base, I carefully stepped down the stairway as it spiraled downwards into the darkness.

#### [WP] Canada is under attack and has to call their last line of defence,if they can find them. They are: The Eh Team.

Score: 1444

The entire area around the warehouse was a beehive of activity  the likes of which Nova Scotia had never seen. Siren lights flashed, cops rolled out lines of yellow 'do not cross' tape, and directed traffic, fishing boats, and seals away from the scene at the harbor. They were under strict orders to contain the area, but *NOT* to move against the kidnappers. Any sign of that, and they had threatened to execute the hostage: the daughter of the Prime Minister. She had to be released safely, and the orders were clear: wait for the Prime Minister's special negotiators.

The thwunking sounds of a helicopter rotor filled the air. Even the kidnappers peered out of the windows, looking for the source of the sound. Finally, a helicopter painted bright red and white with a big maple leaf emblazoned across the bottom came swooping in over the treetops and landed in the parking lot, kicking up a cloud of dust. Before it had even touched down a group of men jumped out of the door. Every officer involved in the standoff gasped: the Eh Team! Rumor had it that Canada's most notorious outlaw mercenaries used to be Mounties themselves, but got caught pulling off a robbery in the National Bank of Canada! And now they were *working* for the *Prime Minister*? 

The leader of the Eh Team approached one of the officers on the scene. He wore a camouflage hunting jacket, had a nub of a cigar sticking out the side of his mouth, and carried his trusty hunting rifle. "I'm Colonel Smith. What's this all aboot, then? What's the situation?"

The officer managed to stammer his way through the explanation: Seven kidnappers were in the warehouse. Five on the bottom floor guarding the entrances, and two on the top floor, along with the Prime Minister's daughter. And they claimed to have set up booby traps for anyone trying to breach the building. 

"Got it." As the members of his team took up positions around the perimeter, Smith snatched the megaphone out of the officer's hand. Then he stepped forward under the yellow tape and held it up to his mouth. "Hey, you all in there!"

Gun barrels poked out the window in response. "You got our money?" someone finally called out. 

"No, no." Smith took the cigar from his mouth and extinguished it into the pavement. It was time for some *action*. "I just thought you all might want to know that the Prime Minister is really upset about this whole business. This kidnapping stuff? It's *really* rude, OK?"

The gun barrels lowered. "Gosh, we didn't even realize," one of the kidnappers called back. 

"Yeah," Smith continued. "Really caused a lot of trouble for everyone. So why don't we all put the guns down and settle this like gentlemen over a pint of Moosehead?"

There was a brief silence... then the kidnappers emerged from the warehouse with the Prime Minister's daughter. 

"We're really sorry," one of them told Smith. "We had no idea."

Smith shook the man's hand and grinned. "Hey, don't worry about it, bud. We all make mistakes, you know?" He signaled to a nearby officer. "Get us a two-four, won't you?"

The Eh Team, the kidnappers, and the Prime Minister's daughter all popped open their bottles of delicious beer and toasted to the Queen. Smith took a sip of the refreshing beverage and pulled another cigar from his pocket. "I love it when a plan comes together, eh?"

#### [WP] Michael Scott takes the stand at a murder trial.

Score: 1442

The prosecutor paced in front of the witness box. "Now, Mr. Scott, please tell us where you were on the night of May 14, 2012."

"Well, I was just leaving from my improv class to go meet a couple of friends..."

From the gallery, Jim coughed loudly.

"Mr. Scott, let me remind you that you are under oath."

"Fine," Michael said, sneering at the prosecutor. "Fine. I was coming back from the beauty parlor from a getting a facial, OK?" In the gallery, Darrel tried to cover up a bark of laughter with a cough. "I have naturally dry skin, and I had a meeting with corporate the next day, and I like to look my best, all right? Are you satisfied?"

The prosecutor did his best not to smile. "Thank you, Mr. Scott. And when you went into the parking lot, you claim you saw a man following a woman into an alley, correct?"

"Yes," Michael answered. 

"And what did the man look like?" The attorney asked with a significant glance at the defendant across the room. "Did you happen to notice his height, or his skin color?"

Michael too looked at the black man sitting with the defense counsel. "I... uh... trick question, right?"

"Sorry?" the prosecutor asked. "It's not a trick question. What color was the man's skin?"

"He... I... I just want to say that I *love* black people. Love 'em. Ask Stanley."

In the audience, Stanley looked up from his crossword puzzle, rolled his eyes, then looked back down.

"You're saying that the man you saw was black, yes?" the attorney asked. 

"Your words, not mine," Michael said. 

"Just move on," the judge interjected. "That's sufficient for the jury to draw their own conclusions."

"Sorry, your majesty," Michael said, fidgeting nervously with his hands.

"Now, did you get a good enough look at the man to identify him?" the prosecutor continued.

"I did," Michael said.

"And do you see this man in the court room?"

"Yes, I do." 

The attorney grinned and looked at the jury to make sure they were paying attention, ready for his coup de grace. "Could you please point this man out for the jury?"

Michael raised a hand, but didn't point at the defendent. He was pointing right at the audience, directly toward Toby Flenderson. "There's the man!" Michael exclaimed. "Toby Flenderson! Rapist!"

"Michael, you know it wasn't me," Toby protested from across the room. "You just said that the man was black!" The judge pounded his gavel and called the room to order. Jim just shook his head, looked at the camera, and smirked.

"Mr. Scott, again, you are under oath. Is that *really* the person you wanted to identify?"

Michael pursed his lips and looked up at the ceiling. "I... maybe..."

"Mr. Scott, please answer the question!" All eyes in the courtroom were focused on Michael, except for Dwight who was preparing to take Toby into a chokehold.

"I plead the number five," Michael answered.

"Mr. Scott, you're not on trial here," the prosecutor said. "Just answer the question!"

Michael sealed his lips and shook his head back and forth.

The judge leaned over and glared at Michael in the witness box. "Mr. Scott, I am very close to holding you in contempt of court. Just how long do you think you can keep this up?"

Michael did his best to stifle his laughter, but he couldn't stop it. "**That's what she said!**"

In the gallery, Pam sighed and rested her forehead in her palm.

Score: 1439

"Alright," said Grokk the Impunifier, raising his green hands ever-so-carefully above his blocky head, "let's not do anything hasty, here."  

Joe glared.  

"All those years," said Joe, waving the shotgun, "you guys gave me shit for bringing my gun to D&D."  

The others hadn't quite managed to refocus their eyeballs yet. Mark had sunk almost below the table, the top of his head just barely visible behind his meticulously-organized arsenal of red translucent dice.  

"You said my shotgun *scared* you. You said the Second Amendment didn't *matter.* But now, with a literal *orc* in the basement, I don't hear anybody complaining!"  

"Actually, Joe," said Grokk, selecting his words carefully, "as I recall, the Second Amendment thing was more your talking point than theirs. If you don't mind me saying."  

"Shut your mouth," snapped Joe. "I've seen your charisma stat. It's not going to work on me."  

"Guys," said Grokk, hoping the others would be more amenable to reason, "I know this seems wrong, but -- I'm just not meant for that world, okay? All the killing... the dragons... and, heaven forbid, the *dungeons...*"  

"Oh, so you think Jared's a better fit?"  

On the table, a miniaturized version of their friend Jared ran terrified circles around a can of root beer, an equally-miniaturized kobold hot on his heels. 

"eee miii mii eee meee!!" squeaked Jared.   

Joe bent down to listen, keeping his eyes trained on the armor-plated orc.  

"What was that?"  

"KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE," said Jared.  

"You see what I mean?" said Joe distastefully, pointing at his friend. "If he can't handle a kobold, how long do you think he's going to last?"  

"I'm sorry," said Grokk, as meekly as his tusks would allow.  

"Couldn't you just have wished to *join* our world, instead of stealing somebody else's place in it?"  

"I thought he'd like it there," said Grokk. "He certainly seemed to enjoy the games."  

"And what did you plan on doing once you arrived? You know how America feels about foreigners with different-colored skin. And that's, like, typically a brownish color, at most. Look at you! Positively viridescent!"  

"You're going to steal our jobs," protested Mark from beneath the table.  

"I just want a fair chance," said Grokk. "Isn't that what this country was built on?"  

"Look," said Joe, "we're gonna power-level Jared. The moment he hits level 10, we're wishing things right back to the way they were."  

"Aw, come on, man," said Grokk. "Don't be like that."  

Joe glared.  

"Remember how I saved your Elf Ranger? Priscilla? I took a ballista bolt for her, Joseph!"  

The glare continued in all its unibrowed glory.  

"Look! If you let me stay, I'll tell you how to get *her* into the real world too! Wouldn't you like that? A tall, slender elf to keep you company during these frigid north-Florida nights?"  

Joe's eyes widened.  

"That's impossible," he said.  

"Well," said Grokk, "I'm here, aren't I?"  

Joe studied the orc's pleading face. He thought about his elf ranger, the drawings of her that he kept in the secret journal under his pillow back home... her long, slim legs... her preposterously-large, almond-shaped eyes...  

He put the shotgun down.  

"Alright," he said, extending a hand for Grokk to shake, "you've got a deal."  

Grokk ripped Joe's arm off and beat everyone in the room to death with it.

#### [WP] Write a story in which the last line is a common phrase, such as, "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger," but when we get to that line, it should have a totally different meaning from the common one.

Score: 1436

People think I am painfully shy. I understand why they think that. It is because I don’t speak. What they don’t know it that I am actually just judging their stupidity. Silently despising their obnoxiousness. And sometimes internally planning their murder.

I like to plan murders. Not just briefly wish a painful death upon an enemy. I like to actually sit down and scrawl page after page of how it will go down. I make timetables and schedules. I investigate my prey’s life until I know his daily routine like I know the first twenty digits of pi. I introduce myself to his wife, kids, mother, colleagues, gardener, dentist. He has no idea I exist. That is part of the fun. I know him like I know that my dog will need to take a shit in the morning, yet to him I do not exist. 

Once I know everyone he knows, I slowly dig. I spend months, years, subtly questioning, surveying, interviewing, I write down every snippet of information. Everything counts. I hack his work email, his home email, his cellphone, his home phone, his internet browser history. Everything. Anything I can get my hands on. Until I know him like I know every president in US history. 

It’s funny because my subjects are my friends. I mean. Aside from the fact that I don’t exist to them. But I know them. I know them like we met in kindergarten when one of us pushed the other of the swing set. Like we stayed up for hours into the night talking on the telephone. Like we laughed about losing our virginities and cried about having our heart broken. And I want those memories to be mine. They cannot deny my musings of our friendship from the grave. Which is why they all must go.

And so I kill them. There is pain and blood. I usually use a knife. 
And fork.

You might call me a monster.

But I'm not. I'm just human.

After all... You are what you eat.

#### [WP] All drugs are legal and sobriety is frowned upon, you've been sober for one year today, you walk into your apartment, only to find an intervention waiting for you.

Score: 1434

"Jimbo, tell dear old mom the truth. How many marijuanas have you injected in the last year?"

I prefer not to toke. I'm not the only one -- I'm the only one with overbearing parents, though. A lot of my friends and family are coughing and scratching themselves, nervous -- or concerned enough to lean on the cusp of withdrawal for me.

Substance abuse clouds the house in a smoke, so thick that when you open your mouth to speak filmy heroin drapes across your tongue. 

"Mom," I say, "it's my decision." 

"I know, honey. And it's the wrong one."

"Wrong or not, I have to get through life on my own. Your responsibilities stopped when I became eighteen."

My father flies into one of his famous ~~~PCP~~~ jenkem-induced rages. His hand crashes against the coffee table, shattering the glass top. 

"*Damn you,*" he roars, "*I didn't raise no designated driver!*"

My sister, the tried-and-true cocaine addict of the family, sort of jitters a finger on my dad's cheek. "Yo, yo... stop! That's not helping. Brother... you've got to, to, to, to..." my youngest brother Tommy goes to fetch the defibrillator. 

"Shape up?" I finish.

"Yyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeaaah," my brother sighs. 

At this point, my sober mind spots the cage about to fall over me. This discussion could last hours. Days -- my sister let slip the date for the intervention a week ago, I just never imagined they could put it together. They elbowed back their drug-induced hazes to get me on the love train. 

"I can see you all care about me," I say, smiling and feeling proud of the honesty in my words. "But I'm fine. I've taken up a drug."

"Really?" My mother coos.

I nod and take out my pack of cigarettes. "See? I've got my own vices. No one is trying to be superior to anybody."

I might as well have murdered president Trump. They give me these 'lost cause' glares and get up from the circle. What? It was over that fast?!

My mother jabs an accusatory finger at me, mouth foaming with rage and a minor stroke.

"Hope you enjoy that tar in your lungs," she spits.

a lack of patience for kids as equipment. "What is it, kid?"

"Hi."

The kid just waves and smiles. Juuust like every morning. All I want is to buy some grocery, get home, eat said 
grocery, fall asleep in front of the TV and… well, that's pretty much it. I don't ask for much, really. 

Retirement really agrees with me.

But this kid. This asshole kid has to come to my front porch every day, and every day he wants to chat. 

Every. Day.

"How was your day, Mr. Wilson?"

"Marvelous," I grunt, going around him and making way to my house. "Don't much care for the font this dialogue looks to be typed in, but whatchagonnado, right?"

I turn back as I open the door. The kid's still standing there, smiling. Waving. This kid's so stupid he doesn't even get that I'm breaking the fourth wall. He just keeps smiling like he understood me perfectly.

*God damn it, I was happier in the Cinematic Universe.*

&nbsp;

I'm retired. I'm not Deadpool anymore. I know, I know, you still remember me as the sexy little R-Rated butt in spandex from that box office surprise back in two thousand and whatever, but, hey, newsflash: Time passes. People get old. People even die (and then get retconned back to life when the writers freak out over not having anything new to fill the gap, but that's a story for another day). And that's what happened to me. (Getting old. Not dying). I'm almost seventy now, which means I'm weak, I don't fight bad guys anymore, and my general appearance is a lot less Ryan Reynolds and a lot more wrinkled ballsack with a mullet(1). And *I-don't-care-about-fan-boys*. I don't care about stupid kids who think they recognize me from wherever and want to make small talk about this or that or play 'break-the-forth-wall-for-me-Mr.-Wilson.

Nope. I'm not Deadpool anymore. I'm Deadpan. Super Deadpan, who roams around town with a cane, buys two 
percent milk so he doesn't get gassy and goes to bed at nine thirty.

*(1) -- A ballsack with a mullet is what happens when you shave the area around your penis free of pubic hair, only to then come to the conclusion that you're not willing to finish the job by scraping your balls with a sharp razor, hence giving your genitals an involuntary mullet haircut. Thank you for your time. Moving on:*

Okay. Today is the day. Enough with the bullshit. I turn to face the kid. "Oi! Hey there, little governor!"

The kid smiles, waving frantically at me like an animatronic doll at It's a Small World After All. 

(Can I mention Disney stuff here? What's the status on the legal department?)

"Kid, listen… I don't know who you are, but –"

"Dennis."

"What?"

"My name is Dennis."

I shake my head. "Yeah, okay. Dennis. Whatever. I don't care. I don't know who you are, Dennis, but –"

"That sentence doesn't make any sense."

"—you gotta – wait, what?"

"You just said 'I don't know who you are' and followed that by stating my name. That doesn't make any sense. 
It's just bad writing."

"Yeah, I'm stupid. Listen, I – wait, what?"

"And now you've interrupted yourself with *another* 'wait, what?'" He shakes his head. "I seriously doubt this is 
professional stuff. My best guess is we're in a fanfic."

I scratch my head. "What… what are you talking about?"

"Oh… you don't know?" The kid frowns and turns his head sideways like a confused puppy. "I thought you knew… 
you always joke about it."

"Joke about what?"

"The fourth wall!" the kid smiles again. "That's why I always say hi to you. Because you understand, like I do!"

I kneel in front of the kid, slow and easy as to not break my hips (God, what have I become?). I put my hand in 
his shoulder and I say, mellow and polite as to not scare him off: "Kid… are you fucking high on bath salts right now?"

"Nope," he replies, happily. "I just really see the fourth wall like you! And I think it's past time we find out who is writing this here story, Mr. Wilson. Because I don't think this is official stuff."

I look down and try to process what he's telling me. "You're right," I say, finally. "I mean, I just 'tried to process what you're telling me'. That sounds awfully like amateur writing filler."

"Yeah, like how bad writers will add little useless snippets of description between dialogue to give the illusion of 
pace in their prose," the kid adds, with a semi-smile. "Usually the description of a facial expression."

"Uh-huh, uh-huh," I say, pulling myself up with the help of my cane. "Shit, kid. I don't know how you got to be 
freaky like me, but you got a point. We're not in an official Marvel story. And this has some serious implications. 
We gotta figure out who's writing this."

"Where do we start, Mr. Wilson?"

I scratch my chin and look past the kid. "I don’t know. But I got a feeling that herd of alpacas strolling down the street behind you might be a hint of some sort."

Score: 1429

"Good morning. First, shut up. Second, which one of you knows a spell to get me a bottle of Glengoolie Blue?"

Hermione Granger raises her hand. "I believe the correct enunciation is *accio scotch*."

"Whatever, just do it," Archer says, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers.

"Second, today we are going to be learning personal defense concepts. How... how many, uhm, rounds, does a wand have?"

Hermione raises her hand again. "Yes, Kelly Kiss-Ass?" Archer asks, sarcastically.

"My name, sir, is Hermione Granger."

"Well, pip pip cheerio and a rasher of eel pie," Archer grumbles in a (bad) Cockney accent.

"Actually, my accent sounds nothing like Cockney, sir. You Americans, always assuming every British person sounds the same. Does someone from New York City sound like someone from Atlanta?"

"You can just say 'New York,'" Archer responds. "Anyway, rounds?"

"Wands don't have rounds," Draco sneers. "I wouldn't expect a muggle like you to know that."

Archer crosses the room and leans over Malfoy's table. "Listen here, real Slim Shady, do you know what 'krav maga' means?"

"Is that an unbreakable curse?" Ron asks. Hermione kicks him in the shins.

"No, idiot," Archer says. "It's the martial art all ISIS agents are required to learn. Observe."

Archer grabs Draco's arm in a painful-looking lock. Draco cries out and begins to mewl. "Oh, don't be a baby," Archer scolds. "That was, like, joint locks 101."

Archer releases Draco's arm. "Wait... wait til my father hears about this?"

"Oh, yeah, your father," Lana says from the front of the room where she leans casually against the blackboard. "Racist guy? In prison because he helped some international terrorist start a genocidal campaign?"

"Well," Pam says from the back of the room. "Technically, it wasn't genocidal so much as it was sociopathic and deranged."

"What, the," Archer sputters. "PAM!"

"What?" Pam replies, clearly aggrieved. "I got a letter from an owl stating I was to report to this class."

Carol gasps in amazement. "That was an owl? I thought it was a goshawk."

"How... how do you know what a goshawk is, but not an owl?" Cyril asks, peeking out from below a table.

"Who do I look like, John James Audubon?" Carol asks, peevishly.

"Jesus Christ, what are you all doing here?" Archer screams.

"Wake up, stupid!" Mallory's voice cuts through the din. She sweeps into the room, long black robes trailing behind her, stringly, insect-like black hair falling down in a disheveled mop over her eyes.

Archer is jolted awake. Before him, on the desk, are a copy of "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" and an empty bottle of O'Dublin tequila. "God dammit," he mutters.

#### [WP] For years Earth cried out to an empty cosmos, searching the stars for echoes of life. From the middle of nowhere, a reply finally comes: "Shut up, and Play Dead!"

Score: 1427

Scholars never ceased to write about how amazingly fast humanity came together when an existential threat was proven to loom over our continued existence. 

We first received The Signal about 30 years ago, right when I had first joined the SETI team. After five years of painstaking work, linguists were confident that it translated to the English equivalent of “Shut Up, and Play Dead!” We had double checked our translation, running The Signal through dozens of double blind international teams, all working simultaneously to ensure accuracy and speed (I had sheepishly -- and wrongly -- suggested that maybe the aliens were just Jerry Garcia fans).

So, faced with such bluntness, we united. Humanity willingly set itself back nearly a hundred years to a pre-Information Age culture. Satellites came down and GPS went dark. No more internet or television signals beaming across the cosmos. The loose confederation of countries that had formed the U.N. now became a strict regulatory agency to ensure that no country took advantage of the global blackout and to enforce the one rule of our survival: stay quiet and don’t move a muscle.

I knew that across the world were many teams working on trying to parse out even a sliver of additional information from the message so they could figure out how to prepare for this unknown threat. However, above all, our team had been transformed from a barely funded back-of-the-envelope operation to the first line of defense. We had to keep scanning for new signals -- quietly.

Now, instead of doing it with bold detectors openly beaming bragging signals into space, I hide in a small bunker nearly a mile under the surface, painstakingly scanning the sky light year by light year. After much deliberation, the bigwigs in charge of humanity’s survival decided that masking our search as standard background radiation was a risk worth taking. We weren’t sending the signals, but we could keep scanning the sky, like a mouse keeping an eye out for a hawk from the top of its burrow. I’m all alone down here; just the machines sweeping the sky and me. I take month long shifts before being relieved and there are dozens of these hole-in-the-ground stations around the globe, all pointing at different parts of the sky.

My display screen has just started beeping. For first time in 30 years, I have caught a glimpse of the talons in the sky. The new signal comes in fast, 1s and 0s filling my screen. I quickly check the localizer and see that this time the message is coming from several light years in a different direction than our original Signal. What does this mean? Are our secret guardians on the move? Or has someone else found us? Did we accidentally twitch a limb and now the hawk is taunting us?

I’m simply supposed to relay the pure, untranslated signal to higher authorities, but I can’t help but see if the auto-translate they have installed in our machine can at least give me the essence of this new message. My heart is racing as I wonder at the depths of the prophecy I hold in my hands. The translation only takes a minute -- the code is the same as The Signal. Words begin to fill up my screen:

“Third planet of Sol: why have you gone dark? Please don’t tell us you fell for that old [garbled name] trick; they just want to keep their trading monopoly in this area. Please signal back if you have any [list of elements begins to fill the screen].”

#### [WP] You are an NPC in a failed online game. Tell about the final days before server shut down.

Score: 1427

Adventurers. The disgusting and temporary existences, blessed with great power, infinite greed and the ability to simply escape from the troubles of the world at a mere thought, whisked away to another universe they called "logging off".

I always hated them. I always resented them. We lived here, and this was our world. They came in droves, mindlessly slaughtering anything that gets in their way - and like a cruel joke I'm doomed to simply reawaken, brutal murder after brutal murder. We "normies" as we like to call ourselves... from the beginning of our memories, we have known what we have known, and learning more, learning skills, acquiring knowledge has sat just out of reach. And what we knew more than anything else was our limitations in comparison to these beasts.

To think we lived in a world with such treasure and riches, and are unable to grasp them. Great magics, mysteries of the world and artifacts that could give us the power to protect ourselves from any foe, no matter it's tenacity. All out of reach to us, and available as readily as my baked wares to adventurers. Worst of all, for reasons we were never able to comprehend, all adventurers started out in my shop. Every day I would find them passed out, never knowing how they got here, and always starving. There's no rhyme or reason - I turn my back, and another injured demigod would appear and demand my hospitality before offering to go beat up some farm animals for me. As if I care for that! But I gave them copper for it, if it would mean they would leave me alone.

The inequity I felt... It still fills me with a hate that I cannot express. I cannot attack until I myself am attacked, but any of them could slay me with a flick of the wrist. I am what the adventurers called an "NPC", a derogatory term for anyone they don't consider essential.

But those days, that hate has long since given birth to a flame. As a baker, I could do nothing to stop the flood of these brutal strangers into my home, my world, my everything. Worse still, after mentioning waking up in my bakery, business from outside of our small town almost universally stopped except for the accursed adventurers, who would demand I take every scrap, fur, nail and other piece of junk in exchange for a few coins, just for the privilege of handing over my wares to get my coins back. The nerve!

It was the village chief who came up with it. We gathered together, chief, the town physician, the apothecary and the baker, and we made history. We would be the first "NPC's" to slay an adventurer in cold blood, and I would finally have my vengeance.

It was the 500th night since the adventurers began flooding our world, and we were finally ready. Every adventurer who enters our world starts in my shop, starving. They will literally eat anything remotely edible you give them, to restore themselves from the feeble and critical state they arrive in. No more.

When I fed the first adventurer one of our muffins, I felt sick to my stomach. As a matter of pride for a baker and a food professional, when you step into my shop I have a duty to serve you something worthy of my craft. Literal thousands of adventurers had eaten here, and while they eventually all move on, many came back and gave me the only business I would ever see once the adventurers came and travel became too difficult to draw in folk from nearby towns. But as I saw this new adventurer's grim visage, the life slowly fading on the floor, my sickness was replaced with a triumph more delicious than any sweetbread I'd ever created in my life.

As his cold, horrified eyes lay fixed upon my ceiling, I knew. I had done it. We had done it. At last we could fight on our own terms.

It is a little known fact that adventurers were incapable of learning any form of cooking. As soon as we knew our plan was a success, we moved into action. A single messenger quest to a major trade hub (taken by an Adventurer, no less!) was all it took. Back then you could actually get messages to other towns. In mere days, every normie in the land was selling goods infused with our secret recipe to our unwelcome guests. It's impact was felt almost immediately.

The first thing to go were the veteran adventurers. The wretched creatures who waltzed through, bought entire shops worth of stock and carted them back to ugly castles they'd built in our forests. Wielding the most powerful artifacts our world had ever seen like toys, I was delighted when they began to declare, one by one, that this "bug" (why an insect would behave like this I'll never know) was making our world "unplayable". Unplayable! As though our existence were for their amusement!

It was not without repercussions. Adventurers began slaughtering food vendors on sight, but we had prepared ourselves for this and steeled our resolve. They had been unwilling to change to meet our needs, and we would show them no quarter. Over only a period of 2 or 3 weeks, most of the adventurers had fled. Not even monsters can fight on empty stomachs, it seemed. With my little shop of horrors quickly dispatching newcomers, even the rate at which new adventurers were entering the world dropped dramatically.

I don't remember when they stopped entirely. But it's been 6 months since any new adventurer dared show their injured mug in my bakery. The few adventurers that survived were the extreme hoarders. We have seen them, holed up in houses with literal stacks of food they must have purchased before the great purge. A month ago we tried to talk to them. They wouldn't come out, no matter how much we called to them. I wonder if they're still there?

Recently, the skies have been growing dark. The great artifacts that had stabilised our world seemed to have vanished with the adventurers that held them, and the number of monsters outside of the town limits is beyond anything anyone in living memory can recall - though nobody in living memory can recall the time before the adventurers anymore either. One by one, we lost contact with other towns, almost always after reporting their last adventurer had died. It slowly became clear that, for all of their flaws, adventurers had served a purpose in our world. Without them the world has slowly crumbled in ways we never knew it could.

And so I sit here on the roof of my bakery at night, watching the lights in the sky go out one by one as I write this journal. I have to stay up here - things vanish in the night if you don't watch them now, like the adventurers used to when they "logged off". Where is it they go, I wonder? Is it where the rest of the town has gone? I haven't slept for days, afraid that my precious shop and even I might be the next disappearance.

I've made one of my muffins, the same recipe that I fed that first adventurer, back when this world was alive. The darkness seems to be everywhere tonight, surrounding my bakery, and yet I can't fight the urge to make food. Was it really the adventurers imposing on me for food? Or did I make food because there were adventurers to feed? 

I've made my decision. I can no longer see anything on the horizon anymore except darkness. Not even the moon is with me anymore. It's just me and my shop now, where it all began.

I think I've earnt a muffin break.

EDIT: Well this got a lot more reads than I ever thought it would! To answer the thematic question that seems to be getting asked the most, I drew from a lot of different sources, including Ultima Online, World of Warcraft (particularly the nod to selling every scrap of crap you pick up), light novels Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, as well as currently airing anime Overlord. I treat NPC's horridly in just about every game I play, so I thought it'd be a lot of fun to play out some ideas about what would happen if they could resent us for what we put them through.

Glad you guys liked it!

#### [WP] Dumbledore is replaced by Ron Swanson as headmaster of Hogwarts.

Score: 1427

"It's true!" Hermione said as they walked into Hogwarts together for their sixth year. "I sent owls to all of my professors as well as the new Headmaster. *NO* textbooks!" The annual trip to Diagon Alley had been quite uneventful without having to fight through the mob of students buying school supplies; Flourish and Blotts had been positively deserted.

"I don't see what all the fuss is about," Ron said, looking over his class schedule once again. "Three whole periods of a class just called 'Being a Man' sounds amazing. I never liked Divination anyway. Shame that we still have Defense Against the Dark Arts, though."

Hermione shook her head. "Ron, you didn't even read the whole thing. It says 'Defence Against the Dark Tammys.'"

Ron studied the paper again and his face screwed up with confusion. "What is a *Tammy*?" he asked. 

Harry just shrugged, but Hermione had a whole folio of notes on her research into the same question. "I checked every tome in the library on magical creatures and Dark Arts, and I couldn't find *any* references to a Tammy." For the first time in her life, she hadn't been able to learn the entire curriculum ahead of time, and it was clearly having a negative impact on her nerves. 

Ron looked at his schedule once more for anything else he'd missed. "And I don't know what this "Woodshop" is, but it *has* to be better than Potions with Snape, right?"

"It's exactly what it sounds like, Ron," Harry explained. "Woodshop. You make stuff out of wood. It's pretty common in Muggle schools."

"Make... what?" Ron asked. "You mean, like transfiguring wood into different objects?"

"It's not fair!" Hermione protested before Harry could explain further. "According to Professor Babbling, my Ancient Runes class is *cancelled*! I was so looking forward to it this year. And so is Arithmancy, Transfiguration, Charms... nearly everything except for Astronomy."

Harry and Ron both looked at her. "Why Astronomy?" Ron finally asked. 

Hermione rolled her eyes. "According to the class description, it is now 'quiet reflection under the stars with Headmaster Swanson.'" She pulled out a bottle of whiskey. "*This* was the assigned textbook. Can you believe it?"

Ron studied the label and elbowed Harry. "*Lagavulin?* I'm liking this new Headmaster more and more!"

They entered the Great Hall and took their normal seats at the Gryffindor table. They sat through the usual sorting, clapping for the Gryffindors and hissing at the new Slytherins. The Sorting Hat seemed unusually chipper today for some unknown reason. Finally Professor McGonagall carried it away back to its shelf, and the new Headmaster stood for his beginning-of-the-year speech. He had chestnut brown hair, a matching mustache, and a severe stare that made everyone in the room stop talking immediately. Instead of the austere hogwarts robes, he wore blue jeans and a red flanel shirt. 

"Ahem. Hello there, children. I am your new Headmaster, Ronald Swanson." There was a smattering of applause as he raised a glass, gave everyone a nod, and took a sip. "Well I'll be damned. What did you say this nectar of the gods was, Hagrid?"

"Firewhiskey, Headmaster!" Hagrid roared back, raising his own glass in cheers. 

Headmaster Swanson took another sip, seemingly forgetting that he was supposed to be addressing the students. "Not too bad," he said, sipping again. There was a very long pause as he closed his eyes and savored the flavor of his drink. All the students silently looked around, wondering if he had gone into some kind of trance or something.

"Headmaster?" Professor McGonogall nudged him. "Your speech?"

He looked back at the tables full of children. "Oh, right. Well, I've never been one for speeches, so let's get to the feast!"

The platters in the center of all the tables were suddenly full of food. Harry and Ron let out an involuntary excited cheer and moved for their forks, but then froze. No roast chicken, no pork chops, no asparagus, not potatoes... there were only two things on  the menu. Massive, thick steaks perfectly seared, and large stacks of crispy bacon still glistening with grease. "Dig in!" Headmaster Swanson told them, spearing a steak and biting into it. 

"Headmaster," Parvati chimed in from the back. "Are there going to be options for us vegetarians?"

Headmaster Swanson glared at her. "Yes, there is." He pointed toward the door. "You know where the exit is. Now eat up! You're all going to need your energy for tomorrow's wilderness hike through this 'Forbidden Forest.'"

#### [WP] World Peace has been achieved and the first crime in centuries has been committed.

Score: 1421

Dale was a Walker. It had almost become a derogatory word: a person whose job was so menial and filthy that it couldn't be done virtually. Not programming new games or creating new objects for the virtual marketplace. No; a walker had to actually leave the simulation tank to do the job. And there were so few Walkers left. Most jobs were left to automated drones nowadays. Growing food, maintaining the world's infrastructure, sim tank repairs... all done by robots now. Dale was one of the few remaining humans who still saw the sun every day.

He was the sole human mechanic for Dewitt Sims, makers of the world's most popular sim tank. The best connections, the highest resolution, the fastest neural implant network. They were the absolute best, and that's why Dale had so little to do. They almost never broke down, and when they did, the bots went and fixed them. But the law required at least one human overseer, so that's what Dale did. He'd been called into the home of Ms. Powers when the robots couldn't identify exactly what was wrong with her machine. Understandably so: no one had ever seen a case like this. They hadn't been programmed to understand what a murder was.

He stared at the body still sloshing about in the sim-tank. The fluid was not the normal milky white, but was a deep crimson red. He'd never seen a corpse in real life before. No one had, though. The tanks were all equipped with vital sign monitoring, and would summon a whole different team of robots upon a natural death. No Walkers required for body disposal. But this young woman's sim-tank had been unplugged, ripping the victim out of the virtual world. And the same blade used to slash the wires connecting her to her peers was buried deep in her chest. Her coworkers had become concerned when she missed the deadline on an important advertising campaign, and her boss realized that she hadn't signed in in over two days.

How long had it been? Dale tried to think back to his classes way back in school to figure out when the last murder was. History hadn't really been emphasized very much, and he'd never had an interest in it anyway. Just one bloody war after another that all blurred together into all of bloody human history. And the killing had only stopped once machines had been invented to supply humans with everything necessary to live out their lives peacefully in sim tanks. There was no more fighting over material goods when they could simply be copied. No one ever bothered to leave their virtual lives anymore, so nobody was ever murdered. It had to have been centuries!

He logged the entry for Ms. Powers' error message. There was no checkbox for "Murder" on the form, so he just went with "Human error." Even that one wasn't used very frequently, since no one ever bothered to physically mess with their machines anymore. But checking that box got Dale thinking: there was someone else out there. Another walker. Someone else going around from building to building who had just entered this room and stabbed Ms. Powers in the chest and then left. Robots in the real world were probably passing him by without even a glance, with no way of knowing what he'd done. This person could be on their way to someone else's home, ready to kill again. He knew that many of the police stories often featured 'Serial killers,' who killed multiple times. 

*Who the hell do I call about this?* Dale wondered. He knew that there used to be something called Police. There were all sorts of programs out there where you could play as a detective and go around solving crimes. He'd played a few of them, and had been quite good at finding all of the clues. A faded footprint here, a smudged lip print on a glass that gave DNA evidence... Dale blinked and tried to bring up his HUD; maybe this was a game and he'd just forgotten that he was in his sim. But nothing came up. This was *real*. A *real* murder. And there were certainly no police anymore. 

The conclusion was inevitable. Dale would need to be the police. Other people could be hurt, and there was no way to warn them. Sims could only be mass shutdown in case of a catastrophic power failure or something equally massive. One man didn't have the power to wake up the rest of the world over one dead girl. He needed to find the killer, and he was on his own.

#### [WP] Kanye West's daughter, for her birthday, asks Kanye to show some modesty for once in his life. Follow Kanye's subsequent quest to prove that since he's the best at everything ever, he can become the most humble man in the world.

Score: 1416

“Hey honey,” Kanye said with a smile, adjusting the golden suit jacket he was wearing. He’d picked it up from Goodwill the day earlier, at the request of his daughter. *Wear something a little more humble,* she had begged, *at least for my birthday.* He was reluctant at first, staring at her as he contemplated his options. Yes, it was her birthday and doing something special would be somewhat polite. But, on the other hand, he had a reputation to keep up. If the public saw him wearing the clothes of the less fortunate, then what would happen? It would be chaos, anarchy in the streets. He knew the kind of power he held, the responsibility his fashion choice dictated. Plus, humble wasn’t exactly easy for a legend like Kanye West, a man who literally defined a generation and saved culture from an otherwise violent demise. Yet, in the end, he realized he’d do anything for North, even if that meant being humble for one whole day. 

He’d purchased the jacket for just $13.75, making it the least expensive thing he’d bought since early 2003. Even when he stopped by McDonalds to pretend to eat anything other than Alaskan King Crab claws cooked in pure truffle oil, he refuse to pay for anything on the dollar menu at standard price. Sure, to a mortal it might be a dollar for some Chicken McNuggets, but not to Kanye West. Not to the man who saved music from a death akin to Apartheid. Kanye only purchased those same McNuggets at $137 *per nugget,* and at his own god damn request. If it wasn’t expensive, then it wasn’t on his menu. 

He stumbled upon the jacket while wandering through the Goodwill, his hand covering his mouth to avoid tainting his lungs with mortal air. It was the first thing he saw, a brown, tweed coat that looked identical to the one every single high school teacher wore while contemplating how comparatively little they did for the world. It was perfect, ideal for his mission. He purchased it on the spot and went straight to his tailor, forcing the man to coat the entire thing in gold flake so as to give it a bit of flair. If he was going to be humble, then he was sure as hell going to make humble look good. Sure, it was a bit heavier afterward, but he was a strong guy. He knew he could carry it. 

“What is that?” North said, staring at his humble outfit. He knew it was down to earth, casual, and smart. He’d designed it himself, made it to fit in with the common folk, the mortals that walked in his presence. She was clearly proud, her face locked in place as her jaw drooped toward the ground, obviously in awe of how humble he had become.

“It’s my jacket,” Kanye said, running his hand down the fine, yet rough material, flakes of gold chipping off and spiraled toward the ground. “I got it from Goodwill.” He contemplated mentioning that he might have made a few minor adjustments, but didn’t feel like it was necessary. That would be bragging, after all, and a humble person like he would never do such a thing. 

“Is that gold?” North said, her eyebrows raised slightly in what was probably respect.

“Sure is,” Kanye said. “The entire jacket is coated in a layer of gold. Cost well over $200,000.” He smiled, knowing he’d managed to humbly address the issue of cost without bragging. 

“Why did you do that?” North said, glancing in both directions as if looking for someone.

“Just to add my own flair.” The poor, modestpeople of the world tended to make alterations to their clothes, like stitching buttons on and repairing seams. Kanye knew he’d done basically the same thing, only instead of fixing a hole, he’d coated his jacket in hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gold. There was essentially no difference between the two.

“And what the hell are you wearing on your legs?” North said, her eyes sliding down toward his pants. So she did notice—he wasn’t sure if she’d pick up on his humble leggings. 

“Just some pants I had made out of an endangered albino rhinoceros.” He was particularly proud of this decision, to have the tailor put together some one-of-a-kind pants using only third-world animals. If anything was humble, it was utilizing the materials of the less-fortunate to make an outfit. 

“I just wanted you to be modest, Dad. That’s it. I just wanted to be able to walk down the street without you stopping to tell strangers that you're a 'modern version of Jesus, except more handsome and talented.' Why can’t you just do that?”

“Wait, what?” Kanye said, adjusting the watch he’d purchased as humbly as possible. Normally he tried to haggle on the price a little bit, stating that he refused to pay a mere $125,000 for such a Breitling—it should be well over $300,000.00, and that he’d pay no less than $600,000. Yet, to be as modest and decent as possible, he accepted the watch at retail price, hardly even mentioning that he’d wear it once before tossing it in the garbage. Like all average folk, he relished in the great discount price he was offered. 

“You’re not being humble,” North said, sighing. “That guy over there, he’s humble.” She pointed toward a man on the opposite end of the street. He was a short man, maybe five-foot-four, wearing a typical working class, casual outfit. Black polo shirt, blue jeans, and some white sneakers, a large bald spot in the middle of his head reflecting the sun.

“That guy?” Kanye said, his head twisted toward man. He looked like an asshole, clearly trying to one-up Kanye. What kind of a dick would come to his neighborhood, on his daughter’s birthday, and try to make a fool of Kanye West? Did he not know what Kanye had done for society? What he’d done for the world? Without him, there would be no future. There would be no hope. What was this douche doing? What had he accomplished in his life? Nothing, not a god damned thing.

“Yes,” North said. “That’s humble.”

Kanye turned the rest of the way toward the man, his body shaking with rage, and began running at him, his feet pounding the pavement as he moved. He hadn’t run in such a long time, his feet stumbling at first—it simply wasn’t a necessary thing for people like him. He could hire others to run on his behalf. Yet when his name was being tarnished, when his daughter was being tricked into finding more motivation in a stranger than he, that called for special occasion. 

“You fuck,” Kanye shouted, colliding with the man’s back and tackling him to the ground. Kanye landed on top, their two bodies becoming intertwined. He lifted his fist in the air and brought it down onto the man’s face. “You think you’re more humble than me?” he shrieked, punching blindly. “I’m the most humble person on this fucking planet! I am more humble than your entire family combined! I set the standard for humble, how dare you test me!” The man squirmed slightly under him, his body shaking with each blow, until he finally stopped moving.

Kanye sat back up, his fists throbbing and bloody from his average, humble beating. He was just like a typical citizen, fighting for respect by getting his hands dirty. It felt nice to be regular, although he knew he wouldn’t make a habit of it. He smiled, glancing back over toward North. She was staring at him, her mouth agape in what was clearly approval, before she turned and walked back into their home.

Score: 1416

"You know," Ivy started, stroking the purring ball of fur snuggled in her arms. "I always knew you were a crazy cat lady, Selina but this time you've lost it."

"Coming from the woman who treats plants better than she does people." I said from my spot at the windowsill. 

Ivy looked up at me with a sad expression and I glanced away, observing the room instead. Her small apartment looked more like a greenhouse than a living area. Every wall had vines tracing up and down and potted flowers bloomed throughout. I had seen it all before, but I didn't want to meet her gaze right that moment. 

"He's gone, Selina. When are you going to accept that?"

My nails dug into the palms of my hand hard enough for them to bleed. 

"I'm not going to accept that, Ivy. There's no way he's lost to me. No way."

Ivy made an unintelligible sound of frustration. "Wake up already. I know you've been gone a while but the Joker, Freeze, Penguin and even Bane are already dead. And the Justice League is afraid. Hell, I'm afraid."

"Something bad happened," I said. "But I can bring him back."

"What did it? In three years no one has figured out what made him cross the line."

My hand unconsciously drifted across my stomach, remembering. "I already sent out an invitation." I said, changing the subject and reaching into my pocket. 

"What kind of invitation?"

A light toss sent the phone across the room. Vines dropped from the ceiling to catch it and Ivy repositioned the black cat as she reached out for it. 

"Password is catz." I said. "With a Z."

"Figures." She mumbled, tapping the screen. As soon as it was unlocked the video started to play and her eyes went wide. "You didn't, Selina. I didn't even think he was alive."

"Bruce keeps the man guarded like a president."

"Then how did you kidnap Alfred?" 

"I'm a thief. I take things. And kidnapping sounds worse than it is. He's just at my apartment drinking tea."

"You're crazy. He's going to kill you."

"Maybe." I said, looking out into the night, knowing that there were only a few hours between me and seeing him again. "But I have to try."

***

Lightning flashed across the sky and I sighed, knowing he was behind me. He hadn't made a sound, the night was his. Yet he had also been mine and I knew him like no one else. At least I thought I did. 

"Where is he, Selina?" His voice rumbled like a storm cloud and I shivered in the warm rain. It was still familiar. 

"Safe." I said, turning to face him. There was no more gray in his costume, it was all black. If not for the glowing eyes he would've been invisible against the wall he leaned on. I knew it was for my benefit that he was even letting himself be seen. 

"Don't make me take him from you."

"You need to get a grip Bruce. None of this is you. Everyone in the city is afraid. What happened to-"

"The city is safe!" He yelled and I jumped in surprise. I'd never seen him lose his cool so quickly. "Safer than it ever was when those madmen were running around."

"At what cost?" I asked. "You can't keep this up Bruce. Sources tell me you barely even sleep anymore and the morgue is filling up faster than the prison."

"You mean Alfred."

"I do, he loves you Bruce. I love you. We want you to come back to us, leave the Bat behind."

There was a heavy silence between us, filled by the falling rain. 

"You left, Selina." He said finally. "Now you have the nerve to come back and tell me this?" 

My throat constricted and I turned back to the skyline, unable to look at him in that moment. Memories assaulted me with enough strength to put me on my knees. My stomach heavy, Bruce's smiling face whenever he felt the kicks, the laughter of a madman ringing out while I lay bleeding followed by the ragged scream of a man who had lost one thing too many. 

I cleared my throat best I could but my words still came out as a whisper. "I couldn't handle it, Bruce. It wasn't fair to you and I hate myself for it but all I could do was run. Run from the sadness in your eyes, the pain of knowing what we had lost. I ran from the city itself, this place has taken everything from me. Even you."

Silence answered me again and I spun, wondering if he had disappeared while my back was turned. Instead I came face to face with his huge form standing inches away from me. Mask covering whatever was going through his head.

"I know why you ran." He said, voice revealing nothing. "And I took all of our pain out on this city. It deserved to bleed. It still does. Yet here you are."

"Here I am." I whispered. "I've come back to you Bruce. I never should have left."

"Bruce died on the same night as our child, Selina. There's nothing left of him."

I reached out slowly and put my hand against his chest. When he didn't move I wrapped my arms around him, not caring that I wouldn't be able to defend myself if he was too far gone. This was my only chance.

"I don't believe you." I said into his chest. "If Bruce is dead, then you can leave right now. Alfred will have already returned to the manor. But if any trace of you is still in there...hold me. That's all I ask."

I don't know how long I stood there, soaking up the rain. The man I had my arms around was like a statue, he barely breathed. Minutes passed before I felt him grab my shoulders to push me away. And I was glad for my own mask as my heart shattered once again. Except he didn't let go, he just stood there, holding me at arm's length. 

"You can't leave again." He said. 

"I won't. Never again."

Then his arms pulled me forward and crushed me in a hug that I never wanted to end.

"I mean I always felt kind of blessed, but I never –"

"*Kind of blessed?* You had sex with every girl on this year's Victoria's Secret catalog."

"Yeah, but –"

"And last year you didn't make the whole catalog just cause you thought that German girl had a big nose."

"Well, it *was* exceptionally big", I argue. "It kept poking me on the cheek while I tried to kiss her."

"She was elected the sixth sexiest person on Earth in 2014."

"Obviously by people who don't mind big noses," I sip my coffee. "Look, are you God? Is this the deal?  Because you come here from the sky, you curse at me, and –"

"I'm not *God*, don't be ridiculous", the bearded dude says. "God's my boss."

"So you're like, what? An angel?"

"Sort of. I'm an employee, ok? We gotta make a living in heaven, too, same as on Earth."

"A *living*?" I ask, behind a subtle smirk.

Bearded dude drops his mug on the table loudly and locks eyes on me. "You're a dick, did you know that?"

"Come on. What do you want from me? I still don't understand how you being overworked and stressed is my fault. If you could –"

"You're one of the blessed, ok? Don't ask me why, I don't decide these things." The man pauses, glancing above 
at the sky like he deeply disapproves of what goes on up there. "But God has his reasons. Every once in a while he chooses someone to be 'one of the blessed'. These people get whatever they want. They get their prayers answered, no matter what."

"Why not everyone?"

"Are you kidding me? Have you never seen Bruce Almighty?"

"Good point", I say. I drum my fingers on the table, pondering what he's telling me. "But I don’t pray. How can I be one of the blessed?"

"Neither does John Mayer", the man continues. "You don't have to pray, all you have to do is want something and it happens."

"John Mayer is one too, really?"

Bearded dude raises his eyebrows. "Come on, man. Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Jessica Biel, Jennifer Aniston? You think that just *happens*?"

"I see your point", I say. "Well, but how does me being a blessed concerns you?"

"Well", he grunts, averting my eyes. "I'm in charge of your case."

He seems to be choosing his words very carefully. I think I know what he means, but I lean forward and ask anyway.

"In charge of my case? What do you mean?"

"I work for you, ok?" he says, in an annoyed tone. "Whatever you wish, I have to find a way to make it happen. Do 
you have *any* idea how much convincing it took on my part to get Johnny Depp to mention you in his Oscar speech? You never wondered how on Earth do you make a six digit salary working as a Games, Chocolate and Beer tester? Do you think that's a real job?"

"Huh… I –"

"I had to make that job up! And then get them to hire you for it! I'm exhausted dude, really."

Bearded man looks at me from behind heavy eyes. I stir my coffee, thoughtful. "Ok. What do you want from me?"

He sighs. "Just take it easy on what you wish for, at least for a while", he says. "You have a great life, already. You live in Beverly Hills in a floating house and you have a pet dragon that can sing Iron Maiden. Can you just… give me a week off, please? Wish for, I don't know, a sunny day, or cotton candy for a while."

Over our heads, clouds start to gather and block the sun, and a cold wind makes me shiver. One or two thick raindrops bang against the umbrella guarding our table. The weather's changing.

"All right, I can do that", I say.

Bearded dude's phone beeps, and he checks it. He does look very tired. "That's God. I gotta go. Please, can I count on you?"

"Absolutely", I reply. "I'll be cool."

He gets up, sighing loudly. "Thank you", he says, and drags himself away from the table, leaving me alone with the two empty mugs and my thoughts. 

I look around. Rain is getting worse. People start to get up from their tables and look for shelter inside the coffee shop. I stay put, and the waitress returns. "Will there be anything else?"

I look at her. Then I look around. Bearded dude's gone, already.

"Yeah", I say, opening a wide smile her way. "Yeah, I'd like to be the president of Jupiter, please."

From the sky, I swear a thunder sounds like 'MOTHERFUCKER' above our heads.

#### [WP] A group of friends playing Dungeons & Dragons attempt to use the game to subtly stage an intervention for one of the players.

Score: 1414

Tommy, Todd, and Frank had never actually played Dungeons and Dragons before. But they knew that Luke was a huge fan of it, and so they had looked up a quick guide on google before inviting him over to play. It was kind of turning out to be a disaster, but they were doing the best that they could do. 

Tommy acted as DM. Todd and Frank were both elves, which may or may not have made sense depending on the context. Luke was, indeed, the only one who knew what he was doing.

"Are you guys high or something?" he asked, as they played. The three other boys looked to each other, before Tommy cleared his throat and suddenly exclaimed, "Oh, Luke, you have come across an enemy!" 

"It's not my tu--"

"An enemy!" Tommy exclaimed, using enthusiasm. "Oh, it is an evil um...witch?" he turned to Frank and Todd, giving them a look that asked, *Do witches exist in this game?* They both met his bewildered gaze in turn. Luke didn't pipe up, just waited for Tommy to finish talking.

"Yes. An evil witch. Named. Um. Livian."

"Livian like...Vivian?"

"No, no, no, not at all. Like Livian of olde. She was an ancient...um...sorceress...in--"

"Camelot?" Todd asked-rather-than-told.

"She was Merlin's arch nemesis," Frank piped up. 

"No, that was Nimue or Viviane," Luke told them.

"Oh then definitely it's Viviane," Tommy said. "Yes. Viviane. She's known for being a manipulative bi---witch. Who kind of treats her boyfriends poorly. And doesn't appreciate them."

Luke just looked at Tommy. After a silence he said, "So am I going to roll to see who attacks first or...?"

"I'll roll," Tommy says. "Official house rules. And you can't look."

"Guys, what is this about?" Luke asked. 

"Just let me roll," said Tommy. Luke closed his eyes and Tommy rolled the die. "Oh, you get to go first, I think!" Tommy exclaimed. 

"Guys, is this about Vivian?" Luke asked.

The three others exchanged a look. Luke opened his eyes. "I'm not twelve years old with an IQ of 57. I know you guys don't know how to play this game."

"We looked it up for like ten minutes," Todd said. "It's kind of complicated and hard to learn on the fly."

"We don't like your girlfriend," Frank said. "And she treats you like crap, man. And you should break it off." 

"And to try and make that point we tried to learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons for you, man," Todd said. 

"Because we are good friends," Tommy said. 

Luke looked at them. "You guys, Vivian broke up with me two weeks ago."

"Oh," Todd said. "Well uh...good, I guess." 

"You guys want to get some pizza?" said Tommy. "I have no idea how to play this game." 

"I'm game," said Frank.  

"Let's do it," said Todd.

"You guys really didn't know that Vivian dumped me?" asked Luke. 

The others exchanged a look. 

"Pepperoni?" asked Tommy.

The gun blasted.

"Fuck!" Hagrid cried, as Vernon lowered the shotgun, hands shaking.

"Vernon, what happe -- oh my God!" Aunt Petunia raised her hands to her mouth, horrified.

"Call the police, Petunia! This giant man's got a bomb!"

"It's not a bomb, it's your nephew!" Hagrid yelled. He looked down at what was left of the baby nested between the 
blood-covered sheets. "Well, it was."

"Oh my God!" Vernon cried. "What have I done!?"

He turned the gun on himself. Little Dudley watched from the corner.

"The kid's an idiot, Dumbledore," Snape said, pacing from left to right inside the office. "I'm telling you, if this is 
the kid you want to raise to be the one to fight against Lord Voldemort, we're in trouble."

"Well, he's all that's left, Snape. Potter is dead."

"Yes, but --"

"And now Voldemort is going to go after the *other* kid who can fulfill the prophecy."

"But Longbottom is an idiot!"

"Snape, you have to protect him."

"God Damn it, this couldn't get any worse."

"Well, if Potter had lived you'd have to help me protect the son of James and Lilly Potter. That would have been worse."

Snape stopped his pacing and nodded. "Yeah, you're right, that would have been hell."

&nbsp;

"That kid's not gonna make it through the first task, Albus."

"Well, what on Earth do you want me to do, Snape? I didn't *choose* the idiot, the prophecy did. And that stupid muggle with the shotgun."

"Who on Earth put Longbottom's name on the Goblet of Fire, anyway?"

"I don't know. There's an all powerful wizard out there who heard a prophecy about how he must kill Neville and 
will stop at nothing to try to do it. But I don't know."

"Can't we just... have him *not play*? He doesn't even wanna do it."

"No, Severus. Tradition is more important than human life. The kid has to play."


&nbsp;


"CLOSE YOUR BLOODY MIND, LONGBOTTOM!"

"I'm trying! I'm trying!"

"Again! Legilimens!"

Snape's head was filled with the image of a Rememberall. The imposing face of an old lady. Plants. More plants."

"God damn it, never mind, Longbottom. Your mind's so boring I doubt Voldemort would find anything useful in there."

&nbsp;

The snake bite hurt, but it hurt less than seven years of trying to teach Neville Longbottom how to perform a quality spell. The boy crouched in front of him. "Snape! Snape, are you ok?"

"I know you hate me, Neville... but you must know the truth."

"Are you gonna tell me where the Philosopher's Stone is hidden?"

"YOU DIDN'T FIGURE THAT ONE OUT YET?"

Neville grabbed Professor Snape's hand, and Snape pulled him close.

"Look at me."

The brown eyes met the black. For a second, neither of them moved.

"You're an imbecile, Longbottom."

#### [WP] Torture was never invented. Countries instead spoil prisoners like kings to get information out of them. You are an instructor tasked with training spies to resist the enemy's kindness.

Score: 1407

Stav paced up and down the ranks of spies. "They will do their very best to spoil your rotten. They will give you the best food, the most luxurious of massages. They will pamper you and do your toenails. And what do you give them?"

"Nothing." The reply was immediate and absolute. They were in the final phase of their training, and there was only one test left. Stav turned, his eyes sweeping up and down the faces of the clandestine service officers.

"You," he stepped up to a woman. Her green eyes met his with a stoic hardness. She was Yolanda Zameer. The top of her class, and the example he would make. 

If he could break her they would see that he could break them all.

He beckoned her with his finger and she stood, following him to the front of the room and sitting down in the plush chair that he provided. Stav turned to her and placed his hands on his hips. 

"Miss Zameer," he paced back and forth in front of her. "You *will* tell us the location of your black ops base in this country. You *will* tell us what happened to Gregor Anatoli."

"I'm sorry," Yolanda looked at him with calm eyes. "I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about." 

Part of him wanted to smile with pride. *Bet I could hook her up to a goddamn lie detector and she wouldn't even blink.* "You don't know what we're talking about?" he smirked at her. "Oh, but Miss Zameer. We have time stamped photos of you at the last known location of Mr. Anatoli. Surely you don't think us so stupid to believe this is a coincidence?" 

With a measured voice Yolanda said, "I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about."

"Well then," Stav rolled back his sleeves. "I suppose we'll have to turn to more...*extreme* measures." He walked over to his desk in the classroom, pulling open a drawer and extracting from it something that briefly caught a gleam of light before he hid it in his hands. 

"Miss Zameer, this is your final warning," he said. "Tell us where Gregor is and we'll make a deal with your government." 

"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about," came the response.

Stav grinned. This was his favorite part of the job, training them to take an interrogation. "Well then, Yolanda. I'm afraid I have no choice but to force this upon you." He revealed the shiny key that he had held in his hand. Yolanda took a deep inhale before collecting herself.

"Is that...?"

"Why yes. It's the key to a new Ferrari. It could be yours if you give us the information." 

"I-I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about."

"No?" Stav reached into his pocket and took out a piece of paper, unfolding it. "How about a castle in Scotland?" 

Yolanda bit her lip, her fingers starting to curl together. "I...I'm sorry. I don't...I don't know..."

"And an hour with our best masseuse?" Stav ventured, smiling as he watched her shift in her chair. "Plus an all-expenses paid trip to Paris? A romantic dinner with your boyfriend at the top of the Eiffel? A dual citizenship?"

"Y-you're lying!" Yolanda's voice started to break. Stav could see that she was visibly sweating now.

"I'm not lying, Yolanda," Stav came to a halt in front of her. Most would have broken by this point and he could see that her will was fading. He just had to push a little harder.

"And then we'll pay for a shopping spree at Chanel," the slow grin spread across his face as Yolanda's mouth dropped open, her hands clutching at her heart.

"Gregor is in the black site two hundred kilometers south of here!" she cried. "I can get you in!"

Stav smiled as he slowly turned to the rest of the class. "You may think that you have what it takes to be *out there* doing field work. But let me tell you, you have a long way to go in learning how to withstand interrogation."

#### [WP] A child is born with a functioning Appendix, the first ever recorded in history and the purpose it serves shocks the scientific community/world.

Score: 1406

Dr. Grell Stevenson cleared his throat.  He stood at a podium in front of an audience of thirty.  All of them were leading minds of the scientific world.  

He began reading off of the prepared statement that he had slaved over the previous night.  "As many of you may know," Stevenson said, "the most popular theory to the function of the appendix was that it served as a bacterial repository.  These bacteria were then capable of adjusting the environment of the gut microbiota.  However, we have firsthand evidence to the contrary.  After all, if the appendix served such a useful, evolutionarily beneficial function, why would it become a vestigial organ?"

The room was silent, hanging on his every word.  "This brings me to the patient.  Stan Smith.  He complained of stomach pains in the lower right abdomen and was immediately brought to the ER.  We assumed it was appendicitis, of course."

"Imagine our surprise when we discovered extreme necrosis of intestinal tissue.  The appendix, we discovered, was filled with toxins.  There was a small flap of tissue that separated the appendix from the large intestine, which we have named the appendoor.  This tissue was misplaced, and the poisons leaking out of the appendix were causing tissue death."

"I don't believe it!" a voice shouted angrily.  "You're lying."

Stevenson continued on.  "We can only assume that back in the day, the appendix functioned as a toxin-storing sac.  After consuming a human, predators would die.  This would deter future predation of our species, and agrees with Darwinian theory.  Clearly, however, as predation of human beings began to slow, this function became completely unnecessary.  Producing poison for no reason would waste energy and be a possible detriment to health, and the appendix slowly became a vestigial organ."

Adjusting his eyeglasses, Stevenson read the final two sentences of his statement.

"Research is being done on the venomous compound, and we will be submitting our results to Nature next Fall.  Thank you for your attention."

An explosion of voices.  All around him, there were questions, debates, and denials.  Ignoring them, Stevenson left the podium.

#### [WP] As the batwing flew from the batcave, it killed two parent bats, leaving a little bat orphaned. He vowed revenge. Thus, Batbat was born.

Score: 1399

I was 4 days old when it happened. A huge, stiff bat came barreling through our cave and it crushed my parents. No reason, no thought, and it was quick; their limp bodies tossed through the air and landed in the dirt. I could do nothing but weep over them. I've sensed that bat before, and several times since- it's like I'm being mocked. 

I am nothing to be taken so lightly. The pain of losing ones you love is no joke.

Sure, at the time I may have been weak...but I've been training every day. I've fashioned a suit of mud that's hardened and become armor; I fly 3 laps around my cave every morning with that armor on to strengthen my wings. 

I've tried to attack that Alpha bat several times now, but it's just too fast. I can tell it's coming when I hear a screeching noise at the south entrance, it must have to charge its powers somehow. I'm still trying to figure out how to do that myself.

Today is the day, though. Today, I will get my revenge on the bat that murdered my parents. I know where that bat comes from, I know when to expect it and how fast it usually goes. I think I can intercept it now. My armor is on and my resolve is strong. Today will arise a dark knight, fighting for justice in darkness. Mom, Dad...this is for you. No longer will I cry at night, basking in loneliness and pity. 

---------------------------------------------

"Thank you, Alfred. I'll head out there now," Batman grunted. Alfred never really understood why he spoke in that voice to him sometimes.

Batman climbed into the batwing and lifted off, hovering in the air. He set his trajectory and closed his eyes, letting the autopilot take over for him.

*thunk*

His eyes peeled open. "What the hell was that?" he asked himself. "Is that...blood? Looks like mud, too. God damn it, I knew I should've installed windshield wipers after the first time this happened."

---------------------------------------------

I laid there in the dirt, broken and bleeding- just as my parents did not a month ago. That mud armor did me no good, it seems. I'd been bested, for I was not even a fruit fly in comparison to the Alpha bat.

*Maybe this is what I get for building my life around seeking vengeance. It's a fool's errand, and I am indeed a fool.*

I stifled my echolocation and relaxed as best I could, to minimize the pain.

*It's a shame that I want to live for something other than revenge now that revenge has already broken me. I've spent my life trying to fly forward while facing backward; it's no wonder I came crashing down so hard. Maybe I'll get a second chance, to actually live a life worth living. One where I am more than just a metric of my hatred.* 

*One where my mother and father would be proud of their son.*

#### [EU] A Whiterun Guard sees the Dragonborn steal a sweetroll but he got away, now that guard must chase them across Skyrim to bring the Dragonborn to justice.

Score: 1399

In the corner of my house, there's a board. Across it sprawls a large map of Skyrim, marked with flags and string, and lit by my one remaining candle. Once, the map marked Imperial and Stormcloak territories. Now, it marks the journey of a single man.

I was a guard of Whiterun, and I was the law. Nothing got by me. I watched the citizens, and the throngs of travelers. I saw their fear as the dragons approached. I was there when one man, the Dragonborn himself, slew the beast and saved the city.

And I was there when he took the sweet roll.

It was such a small thing, taken so casually. My colleagues told me to leave it be. "It's just a sweet roll," they said. "He saved our city", "He's a friend of the Jarl", "I'd be lot warmer and a lot happier with a bellyful of mead..." But I couldn't let it go. He was the Dragonborn. He was supposed to be our saviour. He was strong, sure, but he should be more. He was supposed to be righteous, and just. Skyrim didn't need just one more tyrant with more power than kindness. It needed the law. So I decided I would act.

Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.

Finally, I had him. He was travelling past Whiterun, wasting his time on some meaningless quest. I saw him approach. He didn't even try to hide. How could he, in armour studded with black spikes longer than his arm, on a great white horse?

"Citizen!" I called, my voice loud and clear. He frowned angrily, dismounting.

"I don't have time for this" He muttered. Glancing around to see if anyone was in sight, he slid his mace from his belt. It glowed with an unrecognizable energy, and I could feel its power as he held it. 
"Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn," I stated, hoping to avoid bloodshed. He made no reply; I knew then that I would have to fight. He swung the mace towards me - but I dodged it easily. Again he swung, casually. I knocked it aside with my axe, then swung my shield into his face as hard as I could.

Even with his fancy boots, he staggered back a few steps, his face bleeding heavily. "How did you- "

"I used to be an adventurer like you," I explained, "then I took an arrow in the knee." He looked at me again, more closely, summing up the scars and stance, and nodded. There would be no more words now. This was a battle between two men of war, and no words were needed. Only a battle cry as he charged, mace rising and a glowing ball of energy forming in his open palm.

It was horribly one sided. He forced me back, deflected my guard, then struck without mercy. I felt pain lance through me as his mace struck my arm, crushing my armour, and froze my entire left side. I struck out blindly with my axe, getting a glancing blow on his chest, but his mace caught it and flicked the axe out of my hands, spiraling high into the air. 

"Fus-Ro-*Dah*" he screamed, and  pure force rushed out from him, engulfing me and throwing me five metres away onto my back. I was helpless. He stomped over to me, angered, raising his mace. "Any final words?" He asked.

I coughed blood onto the grass next to me. "Watch the skies, traveller." He frowned, glancing upward just as my axe, with all the force of a 40 metre drop, span directly into his helm. With a mighty clang, it dented the strange metal, and knocked the Dragonborn flat. He lay next to me, groaning, barely alive. I rose to my feet painfully, steadying myself, then recalled my rudimentary healing spell, and gave him just enough of a shot of restoration to keep him alive.

He rolled over, newly-dried blood smeared across his face. He knew I'd saved him. "...Why..." he whispered. I looked at him, sprawled across the main road outside the city, and shrugged.

Score: 1397

*Where. . . where am I?*

I open my eyes. Around me is a familiar -- if bleary -- image. The interior of a church in my hometown. A building I'd been in every week as a child. I hadn't been here in years, not since Aunt Cheryl passed. But. . . I'm not sure who that is, or where my hometown is. 

Or who I am. I try to wipe away the bleariness from my vision, but I find myself unable to. My arms don't work right for some reason. Someone is speaking, though. I can hear their voice ring out as they speak into the microphone at the lectern.

"Jake was a good man, one of the best men I knew. . ."

The voice echoes a bit in the cavernous church. It is a familiar voice.

And for some reason, it sends a cold stab of fear through my heart.

Everything begins to come back to me. That night, that awful night. I was out in the woods with a man I trusted more than any other. 

"He was my friend, my brother, the person I could confide in."

*That voice*. Above the lies coming from the lectern I could hear other words that voice had said, that night in the woods:

*You're pathetic, Jake. She deserves better than you.*

"I'll never forget when Jake first met Kate. I knew right away that they were perfect for each other."

*She comes crying to me, Jake. Telling me how distant you are, how you don't seem to love her. . .*

"Kate quickly became one of my best friends, right along with Jake. We had a lot of good times together."

*Telling me she needs a real man. . .*

"I'm gonna miss you, Jake. But. . . we're gonna find you, I'm not giving up on that. . . I promise."

*So I gave her one.*

"The police say there's no chance you're alive,  that you'd have turned up by now. But the Jake I know would go to any lengths for a prank."

*He's not yours, Jake.*

"And if it's for real. . . I'm gonna find whoever did it, brother. I'll hunt him down myself. That's a promise, too."

Looking around, feeling my surroundings, I suddenly realize that I'm being held - cradled - by a pair of very large arms. Or that I am very small. I follow the arms to a tear-streaked face.

Kate. My wife. That makes me. . . My son. No.

Not *my* son.

I scream.

"Step right up! Step right up and spin the **Wheel of Reincarnation!**"

The voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. I'm near the front of a long line of people, but I don't know how I got here. Ahead of us is a wheel so impossibly vast that the bottom edge is a flat line extending out to both sides, disappearing into the distance. I cannot even see where it begins to curve. I try to focus on the people around me, but they are all indistinct shifting shapes. The one at the head of the line spins the wheel, and it whizzes by dizzyingly fast. I can't even begin to imagine how something so huge can move so quickly, but as suddenly as it started, it stops. Not the gradual slowing of something with physical form, just an instant cessation of all motion.

"Well, well, well, folks, we have a good one this time! **A Dried Up Piece of Gum on the Bottom of a Shoe!**"

The person vanishes with a pop of light, and we all drift forward. The next one spins. The wheel stops.

"Oooooh, a personal favourite! **A Sandwich Forgotten at the Bottom of a School Bag!**"

Pop. Drift. Spin. Stop.

"**A Dog!**"

Pop. Drift. Spin. Stop.

"**A winning lotto ticket!** Oh, you're going to make someone very happy!"

I drift to the front of the line and spin the wheel. It seems to spin endlessly until it inevitably stops. I cannot make out the words on it.

"Oh, we haven't had this one in a long, long time! **Clippy, the Office Assistant!**"

*What? No. No, please--* my thoughts fall away as the wheel, the line, and the voice fade. There is darkness for the longest time.

---

A face looms in front of me, and I am compelled to speak.

"It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?"

The face frowns.

"Ugh, not this thing. Hey! How do I turn this annoying paperclip off?"

*No, please don't go, please help me,* I plead, but the words do not reach the face, and I am thrust back into the darkness. My isolation is short lived however, as almost immediately another, different face appears. Behind it are a thousand thousand other faces, all oblivious to my torment, all dismissive of the help I am eternally bound to offer them.

"What?" the ringing in her ears became deafening. 

"Were you paying attention Ms. Bradley?" *this fucking cunt doesn't know what hit her*. 

"Admittedly, no." she said with a smirk. *He's onto us*. The lighting in the room was made to make people uncomfortable. Ms. Bradley just found the fluorescent lighting annoying. 

"I said; with the undeniable evidence stacking up against you, I'd say that it's time to lawyer-up." *the "evidence" that I planted, this is too easy*, the detective thought to himself.

*What could he know? There's no body. Hydrofluoric acid took care of that.* the voices were back."Oh? Undeniable? Why am I not under arrest then?" she said, her teeth shined like those of a tiger, about to make the kill strike. 

"Well since you don't have a solid alibi for the night our victim went missing-" "I'd hardly call *him* a victim." Ms. Bradley said, cutting him off.

The detective raised his eyebrows. *She admits to knowing the sad sack?* he thought. "You are admitting you knew the victim?" he said.

*We're done for* "I've got this." she whispered under her breath.

"What was that?" the detective was eyeing her curiously. *This bitch is so dumb, I've got this.* 

"Oh nothing, I just remembered something." she said. Twirling a lock of hair between her index finger and thumb.

"And what was that?" the detective asked, uninterested. Thumbing through a pile of photos that was in front of him. This was it, the big arrest that would get him that promotion. 

"The cafe I was at, I believe there were cameras. Being there around 8:00 pm on Saturday would make it nearly impossible for me to be across town- where the 'victim' was abducted. Don't you think?" Ms. Bradley said, stifling a laugh. He was her play-thing for now, but she was getting bored. 

"Emphasis on nearly." he said wide-eyed. *shit* "Look, we found the gun, we are running it for prints now. I'm coming back in here in a half hour and I would hope that you would have smartened up and gotten a lawyer by then." he said, running a hand over his stubbled chin.

A giggle. *Did this bitch really just giggle? How can she be so relaxed? I mean, I know she didn't do it- but with everything I planted, there's no way she is getting out of this.*

"What's so funny?" he asked, there was anger in his voice now. Ms. Bradley didn't mean to giggle, but this was getting good.

*A gun? Oh they didn't find anything. Just as we suspected.* That Ominous voice in the back of her head was right. She wouldn't use a gun. Guns are so impersonal. Guns have serial numbers, bullets have shells, and she had no intention of going to prison. 

"I said; what's so funny?" the detective raised his voice this time. 

She seemed to not hear him. The voices were riled up now.

*Oh he's mad*. the Ominous one said.

I'm sure he is. But as long as we don't budge with our alibi, they shouldn't have anything against us. Ms. Bradley thought to herself.

*They have a gun*. that Worried, shaky little voice said. 

*That's nothing, the detective probably planted it*. said Ominous.

*Why would he do that?* asked Worried.

Because he's desperate, she thought.

*He doesn't have any real evidence against us, we're fine*. stated Ominous definitively.

*Why did we have to kill that man?* Worried was really worked up.

I have needs, she thought.

*And all of the others?* 

Because I have strong needs. 

*We are going to get caught*. Worried wouldn't stop now.

No we aren't. 

*I told you we needed to stop YEARS ago.* 

Worried, please shut up.

*But he has a gun*.

The anger rose to her throat like vomit. "WE DIDN'T USE A GUN!" She said, this time out loud. 

The detective, having watched her twitch and murmur for the last 5 minutes was startled when she finally responded. Shocked when he finally realized what she had said.

After a long pause. An eternity of eye contact. Centuries of fluorescent lighting. She finally said, "We will take that lawyer now."

Score: 1389

Creaking. Shuffling. Sobbing. 

You get used to it, after a while. Doesn't make it easy to sleep, but it certainly keeps you awake long enough for guard duty. That's why I got into this line of work. Screamers, they call us. The civilians, I mean. Down in that dark, dank, bleak world they call home. They look down on us, risking our lives, coming to the surface. Tell us we've gone soft. I turn a deaf ear to any of that, nowadays. 

Gods, I need to stretch. But I can't. Don't want to scare that poor little darlin' anymore than I need to. Y'see, up on that rickety little roof overhead that she calls a bed lays a little girl, cold, hungry, scared... Scared of many things, me being one of them. She often cries out to her momma or poppa, but they're too busy hittin the needle to care. Gods damn the person who created meth, it's even plagued the underworld for the past couple o' years. Blasted stuff, tears apart families. 

I'm forbidden to make contact with my ward... I know that. But I've come to know the girl. She talks to her bear in whispers, whispers that I can hear. I know her fears, her hopes, her joys, her good days, her bad days. I know where those bruises on her back came from. It sets my heart aflame with the rage of retribution. But, little girls tend to be afraid of... of things like me. Thick, scaly hair, eyes that glow in the dark, hideous face. I know what it's like to be the target of unfair abuse.

I hear arguing. That's not good. They must've used it all. Godsdamn metheads. I feel dread. Like the last time I came in contact with a human. It didn't end well, what with my head being introduced with the ground after that punk sliced it off. I don't hold grudges, though. You tend to let things go when you're immortal.

More shouting. Crashing. Coming to the door. Stay away, please. I don't think I can stop myself tonight. 

Door blows inwards, the lock broken. I hear crying from my darling girl, shouting from her father and mother, the sound of flesh pounding on flesh, see shadows rushing, spittle flying... The girl cries out in pain, and something inside of me snaps.

I slither out from under the bed and draw myself to my full height, seething poison in my glare. The mother and father, horrified, come to meet my gaze, and freeze. Forever. Their visages will forever reflect the horror they experienced at my righteous anger. 

I heard the voice of the girl behind me. "Mommy? D... Daddy?" 

After all this time, I couldn't bear to leave the child alone. I turned around. The girl's- Lina's blank gaze was searching for some comfort. I crawled up to her, put my arms around her, my hair tickling her face. 

"Shh. It's okay, child. I'm here. I've always been here. They won't hurt you anymore."

I'm gonna get hell for this. But you know, a blind girl makes a good adoptive child for a monster such as me.

#### [WP] You are a manipulative psychopath, but instead of serial killer, you are a serial helper. using your emotionless genius to make other people smile.

Score: 1386

I prefer the term "clinical." It makes people think of scientists in labs or doctors curing people. "Psychopath" is just ugly. It conjures images of knife-wielding maniacs. Both words mean the same thing: devoid of emotional attachment. So does it really matter? Yes. Appearance is everything is this world, and I am a chameleon. 

My hobby started out as an experiment. I adhere rigorously to the scientific method, you know, and set out to prove that I really am a psychopath. I'd always had an inkling, even from a young age. Others may experiment with torturing animals or even peers to probe the depths of how far their emotional void goes. They want to inflict pain to confirm that they don't feel the same. But I took a different tack: I tried making people laugh. Or smile. Or cry (with joy, that is). And it became an addiction. Seeing their happiness doesn't affect me in the slightest, but I did enjoy being able to control their emotions. They were only happy because *I* made them that way.

My first major success was a young woman in college. The subject's name was Sarah. We've all seen the type: going out drinking every night and ending up in a different man's bed who wouldn't even know her name by the next morning. And so ashamed of her behavior that she wouldn't want him to remember. I watched her for weeks, observing her self-imposed isolation and continuing downward spiral. And I saw her sit in her bathtub for over an hour one night with a razor blade, before climbing out sobbing. I had done small acts for people in the past, but this is when I really decided to go all out. I was going to change Sarah's life.

I correctly estimated that she'd been brought up by overbearingly religious parents who stifled any thoughts of sexuality and independence. Now that she was away at school, the pendulum had swung to the other side, and she'd had a major falling out with her parents over her lifestyle. 

I don't really know why I picked Sarah. There was nothing special about her, and we were barely acquainted; we just had one class together. Maybe that was it, though: maybe if I could help *her*, it would set a precedent that I could help *anyone*. 

The first step was not pretty. She was found in the middle of the quad, passed out with an open bottle of vodka. She had no memory of getting there, nor any recollection that I had carried her. Or that I had been the one at the party who kept matching her shot-for-shot (and pouring them over my shoulder). She was punished by the school, but not as severely as the police would have. I knew that a criminal charge would do more harm than good, so I abandoned my initial plan to fake a DUI crash with her behind the wheel. But showing her consequences was the first step to her sobriety.

I called her Dad the next day. "Dr. Hamilton," was the alias I used, I think. Fictional names are always so hard to come up with. I told him that she was in a coma after a severe car accident, and we needed him to come right away in case she passed on. I can only imagine his reaction when he found out the truth, but it had the intended effect: they reconciled. Family bonds have always been a challenge for me to dissect, but I know that a crisis (real or not) can be an amazing catalyst.

The next few months were a laundry list of smaller things to help get her on her way. I would arrange for her to meet with people that I thought had compatible personalities, and she eventually developed a close-knit group of friends who didn't just want to get hammered at frat parties. It was as simple as ensuring that some of them failed the right classes so that they'd have to take makeup exams with Sarah. She began to study and raised her grades to an acceptable level. And eventually I made sure that she met that quiet guy from her Biology class who'd always had a bit of a crush on her. I'm not proud of how I accomplished *that*, but I think that if the happy couple ever found out, they'd understand why I did what I did. She's on her way to medical school now, where I unfortunately won't be able to continue my 'guidance.' But I have a good feeling that she won't need it anymore. 

I wish I could say that this made me happy. Or sad to lose her. Or anything. But, I can't say those things. At the end of three years of obsessing over Sarah's life, my only thought is: who will the next specimen be?

Score: 1384

Caroline. I learned her name through the phonebook, my shaking fingers carefully caressing its pages as I searched for the address I’d seen her at so many times. 43 Mako Drive, the small, brick house on the corner of Braxton and Mako. I’d memorized the shape of her home weeks before, my bare feet sliding across its wet grass every time I closed my eyes. Letters from her mailbox, addressed to Caroline Smith, confirmed what the book claimed. 

She was perfect, absolutely flawless in every way. I’d watched her for seven months—almost every single day and night—silently following her as she strolled to and from her classes. Sometimes I stayed outside her bedroom window as we slept, my heart racing as I matched my breathing to hers. She never knew I was there, never acknowledged me as more than the distant shadow of a faceless tree, but I knew she needed me. She was all I could think about, all I wanted to be with. Beautiful, flawless, ideal. If anything could convince me that angels truly visited this greasy, obscene, vile planet, then it would have been to see her. 

She was an artist, a creator; she built perfect worlds that only she and I could appreciate, universes fit for the two of us. She taught her art at the community center next to the unsightly yellow pizza restaurant. I didn’t understand why she bothered showing up. The students didn’t respect her; the other teachers didn’t understand her; no one truly valued her. They couldn’t see her perfection, her talent, the unearthly skill she possessed. No one knew what she was worth—except me. It was clear to me, everything she was capable of. The world wasn’t able to comprehend what she could do; only I, and the God above, could fathom such beauty. I knew I had to free her, to save her from the life of dismay and disrespect she endured. Her perfection had to be known.

She always walked alone, always spent her days and nights with a just paintbrush and canvas. The mail at 43 Mako Drive was never addressed to anyone but Caroline, my fingers becoming accustomed to the rub of the ink-stained C of her name pressed into her envelopes. She had no one but her art, nothing but the worlds she created in the comfort of her home as I silently watched under the shroud of the long-set sun. She had me, had my support and devotion, my undying love and admiration, yet I knew that wasn’t enough for her. She needed more, needed the embrace of the planet as they all screamed her name in singularity, hung her portraits in galleries and travelled halfway around the world to admire her brush strokes. She needed fame and fortune, acclaim and respect, followers and immorality. I knew I could give that to her, make her name a commodity and brand us as a single entity in the history of humanity.

I wanted to be the one to launch her fame, the name that always followed her around. I wanted to be the reason she went missing, the person to force her into the world. I needed to free her from this filthy planet, be the one to release her soul to the millions scattered throughout the corners of the uncivilized, obscene Earth. I knew she could inspire the masses and provoke the future. 

I left her alone one night, let her sleep without the comfort of my warm carcass nestled just feet away. I had to, I needed to prepare. It was soon to be our time, the moment we’d forever become names tied together in the media, in the voices of the people, in the pages of history and the world alike. I wanted to perfect where I’d take her, where I’d free her soul into immortality. I needed it to be flawless enough to display her art to the world. I prepped and painted, cleaned and set forth the tools to extract her; my memory became blurred and uncertain as I toiled endlessly. It needed to be just as perfect as she. By the time I was content, my eyes had become bloody through lack of sleep, and the sun had long-since risen. 

She was not in her room as my bare feet touched the familiar grass outside her window. I pulled open the unlocked back door, silently dragging my heels across the hardwood floor I’d felt so many times before. I’d once danced in that very spot, my feet softly tapping the ground not inches from where she slept; I could hear her breathing in perfect synchronization as I spun. Now her bed was empty, the window above it shattered and shimmering atop her sheets. Her bureau lay sideways, its contents spilled out on the floor. I picked up the ruby shirt she wore to bed almost every night and held it to my face, the familiar scent of her perfume washing over me. I continued through her house.

She valued her cleanliness, as did I. I’d watch as she spent hours, sometimes entire days, washing and organizing each and every inch of her home, always to perfection. Now it was a mess, a chaotic wreck of turmoil and struggle. She’d never done this to me before, never forced me to see her in such a shape of sheer humanity. Her walls, once rife with the beauty and life she painted, now lay bare, the art scattered and broken upon the floor. I clenched my teeth as I righted them, muscles tensing as I tried to hang them back in their correct places, but they were simply not the same. She had let someone else touch them; they had lost their perfection. I allowed them fall back to the floor as I continued up her stairs.
	
The crème carpet outside her studio door was stained a ruby red, still moist under the weight of my bare feet. I could hear her breathing heavily behind it, her gasps raspy and strained as if under a tremendous weight. I wrapped my hand around the doorknob, twisting the cold brass knob and silently pushing it open. I had to blink as I peered in, the vulgarity she exposed me to almost unbearable. The room was in disarray: paintings torn apart, brushes scattered across the floor, shelves toppled over sideways. The worlds she’d created for just the two of us, the universes that were supposed to inspire the future, were now stained, covered in blood and paint and split by knife. The hope she’d given the planet lay destroyed in the middle of the room by her broken body. She couldn't even save her own self. 

She glanced up at me, her eyes studying me with a faint hint of recognition and dread, her mouth gagged and broken. I could hear her whimper softly, just as she occasionally did in her sleep as I stood watch. Spilled paints surrounded her and mixed into a single, grotesque shade—red, blues, yellows, whites, and every other color she’d previously had organized on the shelves beside the door.  I stared at her for a moment, waiting for an apology as my eyes searched for the perfection and hope I’d seen for so long. She had been flawless, the only thing that could save the world from the pornographic, filthy wreck it had become. Now, as she lay on the ground, her eyes screaming for *my* help, all I could see was failure and dependence. A mirrored figure shifted in the far corner of the room, its back to me. I glanced up at it and slowly shook my head. She was no more perfect than the rest.

I turned around and quietly shut the door, then began back down the path I’d become so familiar traveling.

I had guarded over Doris for her entire life. It had been a long, and very productive run. I looked in through the hospital window to see her surrounded by her six children, twenty grandchildren and fifty-six great-grandchildren. It was a big hospital room.  
Her time had now come, and it was time to take her up to the big man. I slid open the window and climbed into the room, and much to my shock the people in the room looked over to me.  
“Who the fuck are you?”  
I froze. In my four thousand year career in service of Jehovah no human who wasn’t a pope or totally insane had ever tried talking directly to me.   
“Ur… can you see me?”  
“Of course I can, now what the fuck are you doing climbing in through my mother’s hospital window?” Spoke Jeremy, Doris’ oldest son. I had saved him from a rabid dog when he was 11.  
“I’m, uh, I’m your mother’s guardian angel. I’m here to take her to heaven.”  
“What are you? Some kind of pervert?” Said Giselle, one of Doris’ granddaughters. I had coordinated the prayer campaign to cure her pancreatic cancer a few years back.  
“No no no, I was sent by Jehova to bring Doris to ever-lasting bliss.”  
“That's sick mate, why don’t you fuck off back out your window?” Said Harold.   I’d prevented four drunk driving accidents that he should have caused in the last three months.  
His tone rather annoyed me, and I tried to push through to get to Doris.   “Honestly, I must insist you let me…” A fist collided with my face and I found myself flat on the floor.   


I woke up in the drunk tank. I started slamming on the door and a police officer appeared.  
“You have to let me go!” I yelled out to him. “I’m a servant of God!”  
“Sure you are buddy, just sleep it off.”

#### [WP] While cleaning your basement, you accidentally free the worlds smallest genie. You do not hear him tell you he will grant your three next wishes.

Score: 1382

As I replaced the drilling machine on the top shelf, something fell to the floor. It crashed with a heavy thud. I stepped down from the ladder to see it was ceramic jar that had broken into many pieces. I could've sworn I also saw a puff of smoke emanate from it from above. Was it an urn?

I shouted up, "Honey, did you - do you have some dead relative's remains kept in the basement?" I did not want my wife to know I'd been careless, unless it was necessary.

"What do you mean, remains?"

"The jar on the top shelf. I think I saw ashes in there?"

"What? No, we don't do cremation stuff. Besides, I think it would be weird to hold onto some dead relative."

"Ahan. Probably dust then. Do you mind if I throw out this dusty old jar?"

"Go right ahead."

I was glad it was nothing significant. I had just succeeded in getting permission to build a man-cave for me and my buddies, in the basement, and I didn't want that revoked for any reason. I loved my wife, but she and my buddies didn't mix well. They were a rowdy bunch and she was a clean freak. Whenever they came over to watch the game, or play one, or just hang-out, I heard about it for days after when this thing or that was out of place. I finally got her to agree on limiting their visits to the basement, whose upkeep would be solely my responsibility.

I loved my wife, but I wish she wasn't so uptight about cleanliness.

Setting up a man-cave was hard work. What with all the sawing, cutting, gluing, screwing, hammering, painting. Wish I could afford to hire a contractor to do it all.

"Honey, I am down here, could you pick up the phone?"

I put on my safety goggles and went to work on cutting the steel plate on the table.

I felt a tap on my shoulder, and turned around to see her standing there with the phone in her hand. God, she looked beautiful. No matter what the situation. I switched off the electric blade.

"Who is it?"

"Some guy from the mall. Says you won a raffle. I think its the one we got a ticket in the supermarket promotion?"

I took the phone.

"Hi sir, is this Mr. Thomas I am talking to?"

"Yes."

"Sir, I am happy to inform you that you have won a prize of $10000 from our weekly draw."

"Ahan, that great news! When can I collect it?"

"You can collect a cheque any time from 9 am to 11 pm, from our regional town office on 3rd West Street. Please bring along a government-issued photo ID."

"Alright. Thanks!"

"Ok Sir, you have a good day."

"I already am. You too. Bye."

I disconnected the call and went upstairs to return the phone. My wife had run up in the middle of my phone conversation, in an emergency.

I saw her in the kitchen taking something steaming out of the oven.

"What's this then?"

"I decided to bake some pizza and invite your friends over for Bob's birthday today."

"You did ... what?!" I was incredulous. 

"So..the phone call. How much is the prize, mister?" She asked changing the topic.

"Oh. Yes. The call. Its ten grand!"

"Wow. So what are you gonna do with it?"

"Well, easy come, easy go. I think I'll invest it in the basement. And of course, a surprise for you that I don't want to ruin."

I went down to put my tools away for the day. I think I was done for a while. Would just grab my car keys and go out to get the prize money.

I noticed it was so hot down here. I wish there was air-conditioning here. As I moved to old couch to make way for new stuff, I saw a duct behind it, which a grille on it. Voila! Air conditioning.

Did I just get some strange power to make everything make everything I wished for come true? I laughed at the idea. But it sure seemed like it.

"I wish I ..." "I wish...I could...I could levitate." I thought of the most inconceivable, yet awesome thing that could happen. 

Nothing.

Oh well. I shrugged my shoulders. Off to the car then.

#### [WP] One day a muggle accidentally boards the train at platform 9 3/4 and must survive Hogwarts until winter break.

Score: 1382

**This story now has an official subreddit at /r/magicmuggle**

"How much longer, mum?" 

"For the fifth time, Matthew, it arrives at nine."

I looked at the clock. Eighty fourty-nine. Why did mum always make us arrive early? We'd arrived on Platform Nine at King's Cross Station ten minutes ago, it it was another ten before the train arrived. Twenty minutes, standing in this boring station, by this boring column.

Tiredly, I leaned against column separating Platforms Nine and Ten-

and fell-

and tumbled out onto solid ground. What the hell?

I got back to my feet and looked around. There was an old fashioned steam train on the tracks, that hadn't been there one minute ago. It was painted red, and the words 'Hogwarts Express' were emblazoned on it's side. The platform, previously fairly empty, was now full of people in funny clothes, with carts of luggage and pet owls. 

I turned around, but my mum was gone. I pressed my hand against the column, but it stayed solid. I pressed again, then shoved my weight against it, to no avail. The other side gave the same result when I ran around and tested that, too. 

I was stuck here. 

A few minutes later, a concerned adult ushered me onto the train. Their hat was pointed, like a wizard's hat from a storybook, and I was too confused and lost to explain my predicament. Onto the train I went, and I found an empty compartment. I sat down, and put my head into my hands. 

Another person entered the compartment, shortly after the train left the station. A blond boy, similar in age to me, perhaps a little older. He was wearing unusual clothes, like many of the people here were. He sat down and greeted me.

"Hello."

"Hi," I said, then decided to ask some questions, "Do you- Do you know where this train goes?"

He gave me a funny look, raising his manicured eyebrows.

"To Hogwarts," he said, confusion in his tone.

I cursed at myself for asking such a dumb question. That'd give away that I didn't belong here, and then I'd be kicked off the train, in the middle of nowhere, on my own...

"Obviously," I lied, "But, like, is there a station right there or is it, like, nearby?"

"It's in Hogsmeade," he said, "You're not a mudblood, are you?"

The way he spat the word 'mudblood' made it clear that it wasn't a good thing.

"No."

"Well that's good. My dad's always saying how mudbloods are ruining things for us purebloods."

I nodded like I knew what that meant. 

"Damn mudbloods."

He nodded in agreement. There was silence for a while, before I asked another question.

"What's your name?"

"Malfoy," he said proudly, "Draco Malfoy."

"I'm Matthew Mason."

"Mason? I don't think I've heard of your family..."

"We keep to ourselves."

---

Over the rest of the train ride, I managed to work out that Hogwarts was a school. He claimed it taught magic, which I thought was cool. I'd always loved magic tricks - bunny out of a hat, card tricks, stuff like that - and a magic set was top of my Christmas list. I didn't tell him that, though. I met his friends Crabbe and Goyle, huge boys with thick arms and beady little eyes. Everyone changed into school uniform - a weird black dress over a more normal uniform - at one point, and Draco sighed at me 'forgetting' mine. He gave me a spare set.

Upon leaving the train, I immediately noticed a huge man with wild hair shouting "firs' years, this way". Draco elbowed me and gestured over that way. He was a second year, so we parted ways. I walked over, and the giant led a crowd of kids my age onto boats. I ended up on a boat with a redhead girl, a strange blonde girl and a chatty brown-haired boy with a camera.

The boat sailed on it's own - weird, for a rowboat - and a massive castle came into view. I knew it must be Hogwarts. It was an impressive sight, towering into the air, it's lights like a swarm of fireflies stuck to the shadowy outline of the building. I wasn't the only one saying "wow".
 
We were led into the castle, and we queued outside some giant double doors, ready for the sorting. Draco mentioned houses - Slytherin for the best, Gryffindor for the brave but foolish, Ravenclaw for the nerds, and Hufflepuff for the dumb.

We went through into the room, and I realised when Draco said magic, he didn't mean tricks. The ceiling was open, showing a beautiful, starry night. Candles floated throughout the air, the wax dripping and dissolving before reaching the four long tables full of students. 

One by one, everyone was called up for their sorting. It wasn't a battle with a troll. It wasn't a magic casting test. It was a mangy old hat, that shouted out which house you belonged in. The camera boy from the boat, Colin Creevey, went to Gryffindor. The weird blonde girl, Luna Lovegood, ended up in Ravenclaw. And then it was my turn.

I didn't question why I was on the register. I just thanked god for that stroke of luck.

'My my," the hat said into my head, 'interesting. You didn't get your letter, but here you are. Go and speak to Dumbledore after the feast. He's the headmaster. Now, as for your house-'

"GRYFFINDOR!"

As I got up to walk to the table full of cheering wizards and witches, I saw Draco looking at me with dissapointment from the Slytherin table.

I sat down next to Colin Creevey. The rest of the sorting went by quickly. The redhead girl from the boat, Ginny Weasley, was sorted into Gryffindor. 

There was then a feast, which I wasn't able to enjoy. I was too busy trying to work out what was going on. Things had been confusing enough on the train, but they just kept getting more and more confusing. Just as distracting was how worried Ginny and her brothers were - apparently one of Ginny's brothers had gone missing, as well as his friend Harry Potter. 

After the feast, we were led towards the Gryffindor dorms. When I saw an opportunity, I slipped away and started looking for Dumbledore.

The castle was insane. The staircases shifted at random, ghosts drifted through the air, and the portraits hung on the walls talked to each other and moved around. It was everything you'd imagine from a castle in a storybook, and then some. I asked one of the portraits - Sir Cadogan, apparently - where Dumbeldore was, and he led me through the castle, on what he called a 'brave quest'.

He stopped by a gargoyle, panting. Could paintings get out of breath? Apparently so.

A minute later, Dumbledore arrived. He was an old wizard, and he looked the part, in flowing purple robes, a pointed hat, and a long, silver beard. He looked at me with curiosity through his half-moon spectacles. He was carrying the sorting hat.

"Mr Dumbledore, sir?" I said.

"Ah, you must be the one the hat was telling me about," Dumbledore said.

The hat confirmed his suspicions, and Dumbledore led me into his office, a circular room full of curious devices. 

"You are not a wizard," Dumbledore said, "But neither are you a muggle."

He picked up a glass sphere, half full with black liquid. At his touch, it turned blue and started bubbling. He passed it to me, and the liquid turned gold and went choppy, like the sea in a storm. 

"I'm afraid that you won't be returning home," said Dumbledore.

"Why?" I asked.

A pained expression crossed the old wizard's face.

"That, I cannot say."

He passed me a wand from a drawer on his desk. Unlike the others wands I'd briefly glimpsed, this one was embedded with tiny spheres, like the one I had held. 

"This wand will draw on your energy," he explained, "You can use it for basic spellwork."

"I thought you said I'm not a wizard."

"You aren't. You are something different, and there are many out there who would take you, and study you. For your safety, you must use this wand. Pretend to be a wizard. I'll have your school supplies ordered for tomorrow morning. Now, return to your housemates."

Sir Cadogan was waiting outside of Dumbledore's office. Once again, I asked for his help, and once again, he led me on a noble quest across the castle. My wand was in my pocket, and so was my hand. When I touched the wand, the spheres lit up, and I felt power surge through my arm. It was an addictive feeling, and I wondered if drug addicts felt a similar thing when they took drugs. If they did, I couldn't blame them.

Sir Cadogan stopped, out of breath again, in a portrait with an overweight woman. He spoke to her in hushed tones, and the portrait swung open, revealing a room beyond it. The Gryffindor common room. There was a crackling fireplaces at one end of the room, and chairs, sofas and tables filled the rest. It looked like a really warm, cozy place. It was empty except for an older student, with a shiny red badge saying 'prefect'.

"There you are!" he said, walking over to me, "Where have you been?"

"I had to talk to Dumbledore," I said.

He didn't look convinced, but he decided to let it go.

"Well, get to your dormitory. Stairs on the left, first door you reach."

I headed up.

#### [WP] You are 90% certain your waiter is Hitler.

Score: 1381

Chuck glanced up at the waiter leaning over the table, his arm outstretched as he placed the glass of water down in front of him. He looked so familiar, but not exactly in that “I think we went to high school together” kind of way, but rather the “I’m 90% certain you’re Hitler” kind of way. Something about how his hair fell at an angle across his forehead, how he mumbled to himself in German, even how his face scrunched angrily as he spoke just screamed “I’m Hitler, but you probably shouldn’t know that.”

“Ist zere anysing else I can get you?” the waiter said, the small, rectangular tuft of hair above his lip shifting slightly as he spoke. Chuck hadn’t seen anyone wear that style of mustache since, well, Hitler. There was kind of a negative connotation with looking like Hitler, which unintentionally sent that particular facial hair the way of the dinosaurs. However, it seemed the waiter had not gotten that memo. Either that, or he was, in fact, Adolf Hitler. 

“Um,” Chuck paused. “Yeah, I—uh—I’ll have the soup of the day.” He wanted the pot roast, but figured it would be better to play it safe, just in case it truly was Hitler taking his order. He was worried he'd somehow end up requesting the “Circumcision Touch-Up,” even though it wasn’t an option on the menu. Soup seemed the safest route, considering that Nazis loved soup. Seinfeld taught him that.

“Zat is a good choice,” the waiter said. He placed his right hand on his left shoulder and then saluted it out at a slightly upwards angle. “I vill get zat for you.” 

“Thanks,” Chuck said, tilting his head slightly. He’d never had a waiter salute him before, nonetheless in such a particular manner. Furthermore, he was fairly confident that the traditional salute began at the forehead, not the shoulder. Had he seen that type of salute before? He couldn’t exactly recall, but it certainly didn’t help the waiter’s case on ruling out whether or not he was Hitler.

The waiter turned and began back toward the kitchen, his feet kicking out in front of him as he walked, arms straight down by his sides. He looked like Hitler, there was no denying it. He even walked like Hitler, Chuck knew that. It was a weird way to walk. Most other waiters tended to walk normally, with a bend in their knees and their arms casually waving by their sides. Yet it was 2015—freshly so—Hitler would have to be like 90 years old or something, and have fallen far enough to need a job at a shitty roadside diner. It didn’t exactly seem like the kind of career a somehow-living Adolf Hitler would obtain.

No more than three minutes passed before the waiter reemerged from the kitchen, a small, porcelain bowl resting in his upturned palm as he walked toward Chuck. God, he just looked so much like Hitler. What if he didn’t know? What if he just went about his day serving people, never understanding why everybody was a bit hesitant to tip him? Chuck wasn’t sure if he should just break the awkwardness and say, “hey, buddy, did you know you look like Adolf Hitler? You might want to consider shaving your head and beard. In fact, maybe just change your entire face, demeanor, posture, outfit, and accent.” Chuck didn’t want to be rude, however, and figured silence would probably be best.

The waiter stopped in front of the table and bent over, carefully placing the bowl down in front of Chuck. It was steaming hot, a warm mist floating off the green liquid and moistening Chuck’s forehead. 

“Is this microwaved?” Chuck said, picking up the spoon and carefully swirling it around in the bowl. It looked like Campbell's Split Pea Soup, rather than what Chuck had hoped a $5.50 bowl of soup would look like. He lifted the spoon and tipped it back into his mouth.

“Nein,” the waiter said, his eyebrows furrowing, “ve only use gas here.”

Chuck spit the soup back out, coughing heavily as he practically choked to death on a spoonful of liquid. It wasn’t that it was too hot, or too much, or anything of the sorts, it was the idea of an Adolf Hitler lookalike telling him that they used gas to cook his meal. The Nazis, and Adolf Hitler, didn’t exactly have the best track record when it came to using gas to cook things. The idea of just didn’t sit well with him, whether or not he was dealing with the real Hitler.

“Do you need assistance?” the waiter said, his posture still straight arms still at his side. “I knew ze heim-reich.” The waited paused. “Sorry, ze Heimlich.”

“N—no,” Chuck said, wiping off his lips. “I’m good. I am so good. That’s all for now.” Chuck had absolutely not misunderstood the waiter, he’d definitely just said “reich” there.

“Okay,” the waiter said, again saluting from his shoulder before turning. Chuck glanced at his nametag as he did so. He wasn’t quick enough to read it, but he was fairly confident it had said “Adolf Something-or-other.” He exhaled slowly and took another spoonful of the soup. It was honestly pretty good, easily some of the best he’d had in ages. 

“God dammit Adolf,” shouted a deep, heavy voice from the kitchen. “The fucking oven is for food!”

“I’m sorry!” responded a muffled, thickly-accented voice. “I get so confused with zis new ideology.”

“You’re fired,” shouted the deep voice, followed by a high-pitched shriek and the slamming of a door. 

A man emerged from the kitchen, a stained white shirt covering his chest, with a long, beige apron stopping just before the floor. He was clearly the cook, or chef, or something of the sorts. Chuck waved him over, the man nodding and taking the few steps to his table.

“Yes?” the man said, his face red and voice thick with an “I don’t want to deal with your shit right now” tone.

“Can I ask you a question?” Chuck said, peering around his shoulder and looking for the waiter who had served him his soup. He was not in the room.

“Yes.”

“Was that Hitler?” Chuck said. “You know, Adolf Hitler. The Jew-hating guy?”

“I don’t fucking have time for this,” the chef blurted out, throwing his hands in the air and turning around. He began back toward the kitchen.

“Wait,” Chuck shouted, “I just want to know the recipe for this soup! Do I have to use a gas oven?” He’d buy one if he had to, probably only use it once every few months to make a split pea soup, but god damn would it be worth it. He hadn’t tasted anything so thick and savory since his grandmother had passed. If there was one thing that Chuck could say about Hitler, it was that he undersold the soup.

#### [WP] We've explored more of the lunar surface than the bottom of the ocean. NASA knows what's down there, and it trying to get us off Earth as fast as possible

Score: 1380

It's called the Fermi Paradox, the fact that in a universe that should be teeming with intelligent life we have heard nothing from our neighbors. That where space should be a cacophony of cultures all shouting to the cosmos 'we exist' there is only dead chill silence.  It should not puzzle us,  every day when we see the flash of sinister movement outside our windows or hear the sudden creaking of the floor elsewhere in the house we pause and even our breathing stills. When we are afraid we go still and silent, and all of those civilizations in space are afraid. They are so tremendously, very, afraid because they REMEMBER. 


We humans call our planet Earth, soil, so integral is the land to our identity it seems that nothing else exists but the oceans are larger and they came first. Before life ever awkwardly flopped its way onto soil it grew in the depths, before humankind ever used its wits to become the fiercest killers on land yet others were using theirs to become the butchers of the sea. 


It is humankind that has forgotten, forgotten that the land was no prize to be claimed but rather the distant shore to flee too. That for all that we are, we fled those even more intelligent and more malicious than ourselves. 
When those on land go missing humans spin tales of aliens coming to carry them away, of tests and needles. When ships go missing we do not question it, we feel no need to spin such theories because deep in our collective unconscious we know. The depths are deadly, do not venture there. 


We have ventured there, of course, our sonar echoing and hulls straining to hold themselves together. Initially assumed remnants of some ancient civilization it was NASA scientists and their more modern understanding that finally put meaning to those lines and shapes as launch facilities. Those scientists that finally identified  the gunships, the missiles, the bombs. The great slaughtering race the galaxy fears is not on some distant shore looking towards the heavens but rather beneath our very own waves. 


The cold war was a sham to build enough bombs, the space race necessary testing and the later near collapse of the space program all a ruse to hide the construction of the generation ships. Project Victus is nearly complete, if all goes well soon the ships will rise and humankind will flee the smoldering cinder that Earth has become. We only pretend to fear the day we leave a dead world behind us. It's our greatest hope.

Tom and Clara met for the first time outside Starbucks.

"Have you ever been on a blind date before?" asked Tom.

"Blind?" asked Clara. "I didn't realize. Let me open the door for you." She walked ahead of Tom and opened the door to the coffee shop.

Tom walked through the door. "Uh, thanks, I guess."

There wasn't a line so they walked right up to the counter. "I'll have a regular coffee. Tom, would you like me to read you the menu?" asked Clara.

"Oh, that's alright," he said. "I'll also just have a regular ol' cup of liquid energy." Tom chuckled.

Clara furrowed her brow. "A cup of *liquid energy*? I don't think such a thing even exists, let alone here at a coffee shop."

"I'll just get you two cups of regular coffee," said the barista.

They paid and sat down at an empty table. "So, Tom. When she set us up, Erin told me you'd just got out of a long relationship."

Tom sighed. "Yes. Sandra and I were once like two peas in a pod. But she cheated on me, and now I'm single again."

Clara's eyes went wide. *Peas in a pod?* Was Tom some sort of plant? That explained the blindness, at least.

"Peas in a pod...fascinating," said Clara. "I didn't even know such a thing was possible."

"Oh, it's possible. It was bliss for a while. But then she broke my heart."

Clara almost did a spit-take. "She *broke* your *heart*? That's horrifying."

"Yeah, tell me about it."

"I don't know anything about it. What could I possibly tell you?"

Tom scratched his head. "What? No, it's just an expression. Sorry."

Clara thought for a few moments. Her mind raced trying to make sense of it: Tom was a plant, but he had a heart, which his ex destroyed. Did plants have hearts? Maybe Tom was some sort of plant-human hybrid?

"I'm sorry, this is just too much," said Clara. She stood up. "It was great meeting you but we're too different. I just can't do this whole interspecies thing. Good luck."

Tom sat, dumfounded. "Can't do interspecies? What a bigot," he said to himself. He finished his coffee, walked outside, and basked in the sun's rays.

#### [WP] When humanity met alien life for the first time, they didn't have a clue how incredibly sexy the aliens would find their stupid one-liners.

Score: 1378

"I want to, uhh, thank you for making contact with our planet," President Obama started. The aliens had settled into the White House conference room, standing on the chairs so that they could see over the tabletop. Fiction never seemed to predict that the aliens would only be about a foot tall. "I know that this... exchange of technology will be mutually beneficial for both of our civilizations." Obama had to rein in the hand gestures, which the aliens found threatening. The roaring crowd that had greeted their arrival had almost sent them zipping back into space. Even in the quiet conference room, they were skittish and on-edge. "Now, the first point I..."

The conference room door banged open. "Sorry I'm late!" Biden announced with his trademark grin and finger guns. The aliens shrank back and looked like they would try to burrow into the leather creases of the chair backs. "Oh, didn't mean to frighten you!" Joe said. "Here, how's this!" He crouched down under the table and peeked over the edge like he was playing peekaboo. His face was sticking just far enough above the surface of the table for everyone to see his massive grin. The National Security Advisor massaged her forehead with her fingertips and gritted her teeth; this was Beijing 2010 all over again.

But to everyone's surprise, it *did* calm the aliens. They chittered excitedly in their own language and began to rub the leather seats with their four tiny hands. Biden looked just as surprised as anyone else that they actually enjoyed his little joke. "Hey, check out these little guys!" he said to Obama, pointing down at the aliens as if Obama wouldn't know who he was referring to. "They liked my joke so much, I should read them a *short* story!" His eyes widened and his mouth was half-open, waiting for everyone else in the room to laugh despite having been disappointed so many times before. Of course, no one did laugh. But the aliens *loved it*. They cooed excitedly, jumped from their chairs, and scrambled across the polished wood surface over to Biden. 

"These little guys are the best!" Biden said, rubbing the scaly skin on its head like he was petting a dog and not the ambassador of another planet making first contact. The Secretary of State looked like he was going to have a heart attack, but the aliens couldn't have enjoyed it more. They were nuzzling Biden's sleeves and began rubbing each other all over. He leaned down to the table height again to come face to face with them. "Hey, I got another one for you guys: What is old Barry's favorite vegetable?" The Vice President was elbowing Obama, who might as well have had steam pouring out of his ears. 

"Joe, please, they won't even understa..."

"BARACKALI!" Biden shouted at the little aliens. "BARACKALI!"

The humans in the room groaned, but the little aliens began to... well, it looked like dancing until everyone realized that there were fluids dripping out onto the table.

"Joe, please." Obama said, somehow maintaining his calm tone as he dragged the vice president out of the room by the collar. "We need to have a discussion here. Why don't you go check on your train set in the basement?" Joe's response was lost as the Secret Service ushered him out of the room.

President Obama readjusted his suit and tried to maintain his smile for the visitors. "Well, now that that's taken care of..."

The door burst open again. "Does that mean that there's an opening in here that *I* can fill?" Bill Clinton exclaimed. The aliens practically passed out with pleasure.

There were two beeps in my headset as the call came through and immediately I could hear muffled swearing down the line. I always preferred being friendly, but sometimes with difficult calls it was better to be slightly sharp and officious, to keep people from getting too carried away; I called it my bitch voice. 

"Hi, you're through to the faults team at MegaNet, my name is Emily, can I take your account number please?" The voice was still muffled and so I tried again a little louder. "*Hello*, you're through to Emily, can I *take* your account number. To my left Jack looked across and smiled, he knew my bitch voice and could sense that this was going to be an interesting call. 

My voice must have filtered through this time and there was the noise of the phone being brought up suddenly to the callers face. "Oh, uh yeah, what do you need from me?" 

I let the silence go just long enough to show my displeasure. "Your account number, *Sir*." 

"Shit, account number... uh, look Emily, I don't have a clue. The problem is that my wifi is out and I need to get it up as I have people coming round and..."

"*Sir*," I interrupted, the bitch voice growing ever less friendly. "Without access to your account I am unable to help you. If you do not have your account number to hand then can you give me your address?" 

The phone went muffled again, as if he had pressed it against his chest. "She wants the address." There was laughter in the background. "Uh, no honey, that's not going to work, I'm not going to be on the system with an address." 

I looked across at Jack, who was smirking as I rolled my eyes. "Sir, *all* accounts have an address, it's where we connect your internet."

There was a long sigh. "Uuuuuh, okay Emily, tell you what, we'll use an account number." 

"Oh, you have your account number now do you sir?" My voice could've cut glass. 

"Just go ahead and put one into the box and pull it up." 

I waited for the rest of the numbers. "It's an eight digit number sir and can be found on your bill or on your..." 

"Just throw it in sweetie and hit your big white enter key underneath the picture of your cat stuck to the monitor and see what happens." Smugness oozed from his voice 

I took a breath to stay calm, he was right about the picture, lucky guess. "Sir, if you won't give me your number then I am unable to..." 

His voice lowered and became soft. "Do it Emily." My fingers had moved without my conscious involvement and an account was showing on my screen. 

I blinked and peered forward. The details were... correct and all in order, but just a little... difficult to see. I leaned back and rubbed my eyes and tried again. I could *see* the account details, name, address, all of the usual and I could understand them, but at the same time I had no idea what was in front of me. 

"Uh... I'm going to have to ask you a few security questions Sir." I waved frantically at Jack and pointed at my screen. He pushed off his desk and trundled across to me, the wheels on his chair squeaking as he moved across the grey industrial carpet.

He came back immediately. "No, let's just get on with this." 

"Okay, no problem, how can I help." The words had *come* from me, but again I felt as if they had bypassed my actual involvement. Nevertheless I didn't seem to be able to take them back and all I could hope was that this wouldn't be one of my calls that got monitored. Jack was squinting at the screen, moving his head in and out, but seemed no more able than I was to see anything.

The caller sounded slightly annoyed. "First up, tell Jack to piss off and stop looking at your screen." 

I jolted back in my seat and looked around. "Is this a joke? What's going on?" 

They sighed. "No, just... look, my wifi router is broken, the little lights are flashing but I get no connection. What do I do?" 

"Uuuuhhhh, have you tried turning it off and on again." 

There was a pause. "Oh shit." The phone went muffled. "Did we turn it off and on again?" He came back a moment later. "Hang on." 

I heard muffled thumps and then thirty or so seconds later he eturned again. "Shiiiit, that worked Emily. Man I feel stupid as hell. Tell you what, to make up for wasting your time I'll do you a favour." His voice lowered again. "What do you desire more than any other thing in the entire world." 

A million images flooded my mind; money, fame, power, all seemed within my grasp, but it wasn't what I wanted *most* and I couldn't lie, not to him. 

"I want it to beep once, not twice when a new call comes through." 

Laughter flooded down the line. "You got it girl." 

There was a click as he hung up and I was left staring at the account that I couldn't read, until a second later it flicked away and the normal screen returned. I looked to Jack, who was still sitting beside me, looking puzzled. My mouth opened but I had no idea how to explain what had just happened.  

There was no time to figure it out and with only ten seconds between calls it was probably better not to try. My phone beeped once and I was connected to the next caller.

"I won the lottery today," I told Millie in the same way I'd tell her the rain was wet or the sky was high.

"I know. So did I." She bent over and kissed me on the cheek, a little awkwardly since she had her lightning-proof helmet on. The law required you to wear lightning-proof helmets. "See you after work today."

As she walked outside the house towards the car, lightning struck her, and her long hair stood on end, making a silky circle (with a radius of length: hair) around her face. Her electrical beauty dazzled me, as always.

A few minutes later, I was on the public transit, reading today's newspaper. I was one of America's 1% who could actually read, so I was pretty peeved that the papers were all pictures and no words. I guessed if they ever put words on those things, people would stop buying them. Today's top story was a healthy baby being born, which left me kind of in awe. I mean, what were the odds of 1. a live birth, 2. the mother surviving, and 3. the baby not having progeria?

A sudden tremor shook through the bus. Oh, great. Another accident. A few kids experiencing their First Accident jumped and screamed, but for the most part, people carried on as usual. The old lady in front of me carried on sleeping, the cancer-pad on her right breast flashing "You're doing great! You'll be all better in three weeks!" 

(The greatest invention since the wheel? Bumper Pads™. Giant blocks of foam surrounding buses, motorcycles, cars. Accident? No problem.)

Finally, I arrived at Harvard University, where I taught The Anatomy of Equatorial Fungi. My class had about 20,000 people, so many that we had to sit outside in the field to fit everybody. That was because The Anatomy of Equatorial Fungi was the most popular course at Harvard, which was incidentally the easiest university to get into.

(edit:)

After a long work day, I was surprised to find Millie still there. She sat waiting for me, ready to begin the Daily Routine of Trying to Conceive that we religiously practiced after each workday. With her lightning-proof helmet off, Millie turned me on more than ever. 

Every day seemed a miracle that she and I were still alive, together, in love. Finding a soul mate was easy enough however -- after all, almost everybody finds their soul mates eventually. It was starting a family that was difficult. We've been trying to have a baby for so long, but they always ended in miscarriages or stillbirths. Not to mention it was hard enough for Millie to conceive in the first place.

This time, I gave Millie a birth control pill *and* I wore a condom. "If this doesn't work out," I said, "we'll try a vasectomy next."

"Hello, you're new here, who are you?"

"Greetings, I'm Mr Moon," said the Moon cheerily.

"I'm glad you're here Mr Moon, I have been so very lonely."

"Well be lonely no more, for I'm here to stay," the Moon reassured.

"Oh that's just wonderful, I have so wanted to talk to someone for so very long."

A pause.

"Mr Moon, can we be friends?"

"I think we already are," spoke the Moon.

"I'm glad you're here Mr Moon."


&nbsp;


Eons pass.


&nbsp;


"Did you feel that Mr Moon!"

"Feel what?" said the Moon.

"That!"

"I have no idea what you're talking about my friend," the Moon quizzically replied.

"Life!"

"Life?"

"Life! I have life growing on me, this is amazing!"

"That's...wonderful," the Moon said hesitantly.

"Be careful friend, life has it's...problems," warned the Moon.

"What do you mean?"

"Well, life has free will-" the Moon started.

"What's free will?"

The Moon considered his words. "Free will means life can choose how to think, choose how to feel, choose how to act. Sometimes those choices can be... bad."

"Bad?"

"Sometimes free will means making bad choices. Jealously, anger, hatred. These are all choices."

"What's hatred?"

"Hatred," the Moon said, choosing his words carefully, "is when you don't like something, or someone-"

"Do you mean like when when you get in the way of me and Miss Sun, so her warmth no longer kisses my skin with happy rays?"

"No my friend," said the Moon, chuckling, before his tone again became serious. "Hatred is when you dislike someone so much, it begins to consume you. It bends your every thought, twisting you and diminishing you until you become...less"

"But why would you choose that? You could choose happiness! Or joy! Or love!"

"Friend-"

"Wonderful, majestic, beautiful love."

"Friend, life is...confusing and complicated. Sometimes, life makes those choices before they even realise where those choices lead."

"Well I'll never make those choices, and that life on me won't either. I'm going to love them, right from my very core to the edge of my atmosphere."

"Friend, I'm just trying to protect you-"

"No Mr Moon!" And the Moon had never heard such conviction and steel in his friend's words.

"I'm going to be the best home they could hope for, and they'll love their home so much they'll always choose everything that's good in this Universe."

"Just be careful friend," the Moon said, concerned.


&nbsp;


Time passes.


&nbsp;


"Mr Moon, Mr Moon, wake up, wake up!"

"What is it?"

"Mr Moon, I don't understand!"

"Understand what friend?"

"What did I do wrong?"

"Wrong?"

"They took pieces of me, and twisted them into these, weapons of hate and-"

"Oh my friend, I'm so sorry."

"Mr Moon, they're killing each other," and the anguish in his friend's voice tore at the Moon's heart.

"Why are they fighting each other?"

"I don't know," the Moon replied.

"Why do they hate so much?"

"I don't know," the Moon replied again.

"Was I not a good enough home?"

"You were," Mr Moon told his friend.

"Did I not do a good enough job?"

"Friend, this isn't your fault!" the Moon exclaimed.

Silence sat between the two. Mr Moon could find no words of comfort. He longed to take the burden from his friend, to hold him, and reassure him. But-

"Mr Moon?"

"Yes?"

"I can feel it."

"It?"

"Every pulsing beat of their hate. Every flash of anger. Every anguishing moment of pain."

The Moon looked on in silence.

"Mr Moon..."

"Yes," said the Moon, dreading his friend's response.

"Children are dying."

And the Moon could only watch, as sorrow gripped the Earth.

And in it's grief, the Earth cracked.

#### [WP] A jobless computer programmer, while hacking at home one night, discovers a port to the Unirnet, an computer network made for a series of interconnected planets who have not yet discovered mankind.

Score: 1363

From the moment that the connection was made, the entity known as "WhyteHaute" was struck by one thought above all others: This was taking *entirely* too long.

It was probably the fault of some old, neglected server in the back corner of an office in which the letters "IT" were only used to reference a Tim Curry film. That would certainly account for both the incredible lag time and the massive influx of garbage data. Oh, there were some recognizable bytes in there, but only a handful of them made sense.

Suddenly, there was a blip, followed by a single line.

    1X:11:10:09:08:07:06:05:04:03:02:01

Taken at face value, it was little more than a broken and nonsensical string of hexidecimal code. Another glance, however, revealed a strange pattern. It *almost* looked like a string of numbers, albeit one written in Base-12.

A clatter of keys became audible.

    \\net.send 12

As with before, there was a blip.

    4545:0000

This was going nowhere. At *best*, these phantom lines were the result of some broken authentication program. At worst, they were the ramblings of some bored systems administrator with a penchant for inane puzzles.

Definitely a bored administrator. Well, that was fine.

    \\net.send Shut me out if you can.

Another of those damnably long pauses passed before the response arrived.

That one *almost* made sense. Perhaps it wasn't an administrator after all, but rather a non-English speaker in some third-world country.

    \\net.send This is WhyteHaute. I'm not doing anything destructive.    
    \\net.send I was just curious.    
    \\net.send Where are you located? What language do you speak?

*That* was clear enough.

    \\net.send I speak English. I'm from the United States of America.

#### [WP] You are acing every class at the International Espionage Academy except one: Post Kill Puns.

Score: 1359

A drop of sweat rolled down his forehead, and slid into his eyes. It stung. Mr. Blond sucked in his breath. He turned his head away, making a clandestine attempt to wipe away the sweat before the Judges noticed.

One of the judges cleared her throat, "Something wrong, Mr. Blond?"

"No," he said, swallowing hard, "Please continue," 

At the center of the bench was a much older woman with short, white hair and a severe expression on her face. He knew her only as Agent N. She stared at him hard, without blinking, until he shifted uncomfortably in his chair.

Agent N cleared her throat before she spoke: 

"Alright, Mr. Blond. You're on a boat, blindfolded. You don't know where you are, but you do know that your target is right behind you. He has a gun aimed at your back, what do you do?"

"I wait for a wave to hit and disrupt his aim. Then, I sweep my leg around, and hit him off the boat. As he falls into the water, I shout, '*Sea* you later!'"

Agent N pressed her lips together, and he thought he saw her shake her head. As she scribbled away on the paper in front of her, he wiped the sweat from his forehead, willing himself to do better. 

At last, she cleared her throat, and asked: 

"You're in a cave. Your face an army of savages, wielding knives as long as your forearm. Your hands are tied behind your back, and they are running at you, screaming for your blood."

Mr. Blond bowed his head, whispering under his breath.

"Mr. Blond? An answer, please."

"Okay. Okay. I use my toe to press a trigger in my shoe. It sets off an explosive that shakes the cave, and makes spikes fall from the ceiling."

Agent N held up a hand to stop him, "Spikes?"

"You know, those pointy things that grow in caves."

"Oh. You mean stalactites."

"Yeah. Stalacspikes. And after the spikes fall down and impale them, I say, "Never bring a knife to a spike fight."

He watched as Agent N made a mighty effort to *not* roll her eyes. Instead, she scribbled furiously on her paper.

"Last question. You're in the villain's secret hideout. More specifically, you've snuck in through the mail room, when a pair of guards notice your presence. As the fight progresses, all three of you lose your weapons, and it devolves into a battle with the sharp, pointed edges of mail."

Mr. Blond sucked in a long breath.

*You can do this. Come on.*

He bounced his leg, he drummed his fingers, and he bit his lip. 

"Mr. Blond, you have ten seconds remaining."

"Is the villain's hideout in a mountain?"

"Yes."

"And how many guards are there?"

"Two."

"I picked up a rock from outside, and kept it in my pocket. When they start throwing mail at me, I take out my rock, and I bash one over the head. I throw the rock at the other, and when he falls to the floor, I stand over him. I say, 'I guess rock *can* beat paper.'"

Even sitting this far away, he could feel the breeze from Agent N's massive sigh.

"Mr. Blond, you have, without a doubt, the *lamest* sense of humor I've have ever had the misfortune of encountering."

His stomach sank.

"Fortunately and *mysteriously*, that is exactly what High Command ordered. As much as it hurts me to say this, I must congratulate you, Mr. Blond. You passed."

At this, Mr. Blond stood up. He yanked a knife from inside his coat. Before any of the judges could react, he ran up to the bench, and stabbed the knife into Agent N's paper.

"Blond!" she gasped, throwing up her hands as he shredded the paper, "What on Earth do you think you're doing?"

"I wanted to be sure," he said, "that I made the cut."

Agent N narrowed her eyes.

"Out. Now."

#### [WP] Among Alien species humans are famous for prefering pacifism but being the most dangerous species when they are forced to fight.

Score: 1354

There was no doubt in anyone's mind that human beings were one of the Galaxy's most pacifistic species.

Xeno-history books tell us that once, they waged endless wars upon themselves, shedding rivers of blood and claiming little bits of land from each other on their medium-sized, blue-and-green planet. But a worldwide nuclear disaster changed their attitude irrevocably - guns and missiles were exchanged for fresh food and water to feed, and pen and paper to teach. They archived their past, good and bad, and freely distributed it. Every human eventually viewed these records; all rejoiced at the love, and all wept at the atrocities. 

Humans blossomed back to life just in time for their First Contact, and the Council welcomed them with open arms. There were already too many belligerent races in the galaxy, and humans, though still flawed and imperfect in so many ways, represented an ideal. Interspecies trade flourished, both of material goods and knowledge; human became a household word for creativity and peace. 

But not everyone felt so warmly about the human race.

Many alien species saw the human's pacifism as a golden opportunity. The Council was still young and fragile at this point; all of these beings, so different in appearance and mannerisms, were still learning to play and work with each other. And some of them liked to play very rough. So it was not particularly surprising when the Mad'ra, well-known for using their violence to underscore their demands, began to bully the humans as well. They wanted the rich resources on human-owned colonies, and would stop at nothing to get them. Protests from both humans and the Council did not deter them.

One day, a fleet of Mad'ra warships jumped to a human military outpost and began firing without warning. The station was devastated, and the remaining humans withdrew hastily. A plea was sent out by the human seat of power, asking for peace and diplomacy. The Mad'ra laughed it off and sent more fleets, only to find deserted stations: the humans had already retreated. They cheered in triumph over this weak prey.

Not for long, though. 

On a major Mad'ra world, the citizens looked at the sky, puzzled. There were suddenly a lot more stars in the sky than usual, and what's more, they seem to be growing. Soon, the "stars" grew large enough and it was a military satellite that recognized them as human ships. Thousands of vessels, equipped with the signia for scientific research. It was confusing, but the Mad'ra simply responded the way they always did: by firing their weapons. 

The ships came through, unscathed. The Mad'ra watched, slack-jawed and bewildered, as their lasers burned themselves away on force fields surrounding the ships, technology that no one had known the humans to be capable of. They did not fire back, either; they simply zoomed past, entering the atmosphere and hovering above major cities. Eventually, the Mad'ra grew tired and demanded to know what the humans thought they were doing. In response, the ships began ejecting millions of long, thin canisters that spewed out a wispy silver gas.

Within minutes, the citizens underneath began to tear each other apart. Friends and lovers turned on each other, grabbing whatever was closest at hand to destroy the other. The ships silently departed not long after, still without communication. Days and days passed as the Mad'ra government struggled to normalize the situation, mostly by waiting and despairing; they could do nothing to stop the disease of madness that had caught their people. In the end, millions lay dead or injured.

Eventually, the humans sent the Mad'ra a curt, chilling letter:

**The gas used on Bex-9 is a chemical weapon acutely based on Mad'ra neuro-biology and designed to heighten aggressiveness and fear. We released an attenuated, short-lived version as a test, one which we deem it successful. This message is your first and final warning: cease violent, anti-human operations at once or we will scale up our extermination protocol.**

The Mad'ra pulled back all their fleets immediately. They dealt poorly with groups that stood for themselves.

The message was freely accessible by all other races and it prompted the Council to make a series of laws forbidding the use of weaponry, chemical or otherwise, upon major civilian centers. In response, the human diplomats publicly apologized for their actions, despite the fact that few felt sympathetic toward the Mad'ra at all. 

But feelings toward humans were changed now, at least on a subconscious level. They continued to show themselves as a bastion of peace, trade and knowledge in the galaxy, but the Mad'ra incident had raised important questions. How had the humans created such a terrifying, specific weapon in total secret, and in so little time? Did they have hidden research facilities in which they continued to upgrade and develop weaponry? And were contingency plans in place for the other races as well?

There was no doubt in anyone's mind that human beings were one of the Galaxy's most dangerous species.

#### [WP] Vampires are not the bloodthirsty monsters people believe them to be. For millennia their bite has been one of inoculation against the worst plagues and infections of history, humanity's greatest disease outbreaks coinciding with periods we had hunted them to near extinction.

Score: 1349

My brothers and sisters are dead. The existence of my species hangs on a precipice. 

We called ourselves the guardians of humanity, our saliva protecting them for millenia. Viruses, plagues, toxins - they would be extinct a thousand times over without us watching over them. 

And yet they hunted *us* to within a breath of extinction, not realising the potential consequences of their actions.

I am the last of the Vampires. I hid for years in the deepest shadows to preserve my race, but I could not hide forever. Humanity was dying. A new plague had befallen them; it killed in hours and spread through the breeze. In months the human population fell from billions to a mere million.

I was not able to stay back and watch the end of humanity. I was created to save humanity. And so, I stepped out of the darkness and did what I had to. During nights I would enter houses and find the inhabitants. I would ingest their blood and fortify it before replacing it. I inoculated many before I was found.

This time they understood; the people with bite marks were immune to the plague. They knew I could save them, that I wanted to help. Yet, they hunted me still. 

And here I am. Arms, legs and neck tied with heavy chains. Fresh garlic is placed around my cell daily to keep me weak.  My mouth is pried open, my fangs protruding. I have been here for years.

They come regularly and press my fangs into their neck. Once inoculated, they leave and the next arrives. The plague is over,  but they use me for prevention.

They killed my race with ignorance. They now have knowledge and choose to enslave me. The reason for my existence was to preserve humanity. If ever I am free, I will instead be their executioner.

"Because it's dirty," she said. She looked up at the clock. 5:15. She had a little more than an hour. Shit. Her stomach was already tying itself up into knots. She need to figure out how to handle this, and she needed to do it fast. 

She also needed to clean the kitchen.

She ducked under the sink to sift through her collection of almost-empty cleaning supplies and settled on a foamy bottle of Windex.

A deep, feral growl rumbled through the kitchen, rattling the cabinets. Mal turned, holding the Windex like a weapon, aimed directly at the kitten who was now perched on her countertop.

"Put that down," he commanded, his voice far larger than his tiny form.

"Use your inside voice," Mal replied.

Orange eyes narrowed. A moment of tension stretched between them.

The rumbling growl faded. Mal sighed.

"I would appreciate a straight answer," the cat said.

"Yeah, I bet you would," Mal replied. "Funny, how you always want a straight answer from me, but you seem incapable of giving them, yourself."

He lifted his chin. "Perhaps you simply do not know the right questions to ask?"

Could she put him away somewhere? But where? He had escaped from the cat carrier three times, already. Shoeboxes were easy prey; he enjoyed wreaking utter destruction upon them. He even knew how to open doors, for Christ's sake. *Locked* doors. 

Mal turned away and started wiping down the kitchen counters. She needed time to think.

"Yeah, well, neither do you," she muttered.

Tiny, vicious claws pricked her skin as a ball of fluff materialized on her shoulder.

"Apparently not," he said with a huff of amusement. "How about this, then: you tell me what's going on, and I'll give you a real answer to a question of your choice."

Maybe the crisper drawer in the fridge would hold him for a while?

"Three," she said aloud. "I tell you what's going on, and you answer any *three* questions, straight up."

He dug his claws a little bit deeper into her flesh. Mal did not wince.

"Two," he snapped.

"Three, and I'll give you pinch of catnip."

"And I want wet food for dinner," the cat said, his voice shadowed by a faint purr. "The beef flavor, the one with the cheese in it!"

"All of that, plus I'll turn on the heated blanket," Mal said, reaching up to rub the soft, downy white fur on the top of the kitten's head. His claws retracted, and the pain disappeared. "But I want you to promise you'll behave, tonight."

Orange eyes widened.

"I always behave!" he said with an indignant squeak.

"Promise me, little demon."

He batted her face playfully with his tiny white paw. 

"You just wait until I'm freed from this form, darling," he said. "I'll show you *little*."

"Your word, cat."

The little beast sighed. "Very well. I hereby bind myself to the terms of our agreement. I will answer three of Mallory's questions, in full and without deception or misdirection, and I will behave myself for the remainder of the evening." His words echoed, vibrating through the air as he intoned them with his power, signifying a binding contract. "Happy?"

"Yes," Mal said with a smile.

"Good. Now, tell me what's going on. Please."

Mal picked him up and settled him in the crook of her arm, carrying him up the stairs and into the bedroom.

"I have a date," she said as she switched on the electric blanket on her bed.

He went very still in her arms.

"You have a *what*?"

"A date," Mal said, setting the cat onto the blanket. "His name is Lee. I met him at work. I'm making us dinner and then we're going to watch a movie. And you are going to stay up here, all night, without making a sound, just like you promised."

Every hair on the kitten's body stood on end, puffing him up like a furry, angry marshmallow.

"I never promised to be quiet," he said mutinously.

"You promised to behave," Mal replied, her voice calm. "You are bound to me by your word. I am clarifying the contract."

"Why you... you scheming little witch!" He pounced on her, gnawing on the sleeve of her jacket like it was his favorite mouse toy. "I'll... grnff... get you back... frrfffll... for this!"

Mal reached into her desk drawer and pulled out a small plastic bag. She grabbed a pinch of the dried, green substance within and sprinkled it onto her little demon-cat's nose.

The change was instantaneous. He opened his eyes, blinked a few times, and released his death-grip on her arm, arching his back in a leisurely stretch and licking his paw to avoid having to meet her eyes.

"Sorry about that, love," he purred. "My temper got the better of me for a moment."

"It's okay," Mal said, smiling as she popped open a can of wet food and set it on the desk. "So long as you don't try to eat me once you're freed from your tiny, furry prison."

The little devil laughed. "You have my word on that, Mallory."

Mal nodded and turned to head back downstairs. As she closed the bedroom door behind her, she heard a purring voice murmur:

"I would never harm my favorite pet."

#### [WP] Satan and God both occasionally come to Earth in human form, Satan to corrupt souls, God to relax and observe his creation. One day, Satan walks into a pub, and sees God (in human form) sitting at the bar. God looks at Satan, slides a beer over to him, and indicates the empty stool to his left

Score: 1347

It must have been half-past midnight when I saw Him, looking comfortable on a stool and apparently engaged in a conversation with the very pretty dark-haired girl behind the bar. Only He could manage to look comfortable on one of those hard wooden stools—the picture of relaxation in a bar full of high school dropouts and failed runaway attempts. I could see all of that about them, the patrons of the bar. I could always see the worst in people, but He could always see the best. Which probably explained why He was explaining the finer points of the theory of abiogenisis to a girl who had put down her parents’ dog because she couldn’t afford to take care of it.

I strolled up to the bar, in my usual way. He knew I would be here, of course, He was only pretending to be surprised for the benefit of the girl behind the bar. He ordered me a beer, and indicated that I should sit, to His left, on an empty stool. The bar was packed, but of course the stool was vacant. I sat.

 “What brings you here?” He asked me, again for the benefit of the barkeep. I shot her a glance and she wandered away, cleaning glasses at the far end of the bar.

“You know perfectly well what brings me here. It’s the same thing it always was.” I snipped back, watching the droplets of condensation form on my glass of beer. “You knew I would be here, why did you come here?”

He seemed surprised by my hostility—or at least, He did, until I looked closer and saw that He was still putting on his stupid show, for anyone who might be listening in. He appeared to be waiting for me to say something else, but I waited longer. He relented. “I wanted to check in with you. There are some things even I can’t know for sure.”

I scoffed at this. He was lying. I was at least 75% sure that He was lying. “Well, check away.” I finally responded, taking a sip of the beer he had gotten for me. I didn’t much like it. Beer wasn’t to my tastes.

He looked worried now. I wasn’t sure if He was worried about me, or about someone hearing what He was about to ask, but He did look worried. “I wanted to check in with you about… recent events. I wanted to make sure you knew what you were doing.”

I put the beer down. I didn’t look at Him. The droplets of condensation were racing each other down the glass and I couldn’t look at Him, but I couldn’t keep a straight face. A devilish smirk finally emerged, and I met His gaze.

“I haven’t done anything in years, old friend. Your children have long since rendered me obsolete.”

"Not again," moaned George from the back.

"What?" said Bob.

Larry stood up. "Guys, gals, I think it's time. Everyone to the conference room please." 

Bob's co-workers collectively sighed, got up from their chairs, and strolled over to the conference room, whispering amongst themselves along the way. Bob tagged behind, looking like he was hit by a Confundus charm.

The workers took their usual seats along the table, with Larry sitting at the head.

"Bob, I believe in honesty and straightforwardness, so I'm just going to go out and say it. No one here cares that you're a robot."

"Wait, wha-"

"Seriously dude, we're sick of hearing about it." said Dave, who was in the middle of a game of Temple Run. "It's all the time with you, man. It never ends."

"And it's such a subtle brag. At least R-X29 is direct about it." said Josephina.

"Beep, beep," beeped R-X29.

"Yeah, like take right now for instance. 'I can't log-in, guys; this captcha thing is telling me I might be a robot, guys. Did you know that I'm a robot, guys?'" said George mockingly. "Like, just shut up man!"

"Is this a joke?" said Bob.

"What the fuck are you guys on about? I'm not a ro-."

"Uh, get over yourself," said Josephina.

"Alright guys, everyone back to work. I think he got the message," said Larry.

They all filed out of the conference room, including Bob, who headed over to his desk even more confused than before. The moment he sat down, someone called and his ringtone went off.

"*Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.* *Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.*"

#### [WP] Write a story with a large, illogical plot hole, then have the main character discover it.

Score: 1343

Mark shuffled through the desk's drawers searching for that vital piece of evidence. Who had killed his father? Who was the mysterious "X" who kept leaving him clues? Who had kidnapped his missing co-worker Elliot?

"Stand back and put your hands up." The shadow of a gun came from the darkness, making Mark jump. The voice was familiar. Who could it be? "Foolish Mark, very very foolish." The face was shrouded in silouette, only the shape of lips could be seen.

Mark took a deep breath. This must be it, this must be the man who killed my father. "Did you do it?" Mark pleaded. The face moved forward "Yes." Light struck the curves of his face. Mark gasped. "Elliot...but...you killed my father?" Elliot smiled. "Of course not. It would be impossible for me to have killed your father...for I *am* your father."

Mark's brow creased in confusion. "But you're only..." Mark paused to do the math on his fingers "...5 years older than I am. How could you possibly be my father!?" Elliot pushed the gun forward angrily. "Silence. Ok, I'm not your father...but I am the man who has been leaving you clues. I am X!"

With more confusion and an ever creasing brow Mark interjected "But...why would you be leaving me clues to find if you were the one who has done the crime? It doesn't make sense!" 

Elliot's face went a dark shade of red. His cheeks shook. "I said 'SILENCE'" Elliot shot into the wall but it wasn't enough, Mark continued. "And why the hell did you go missing? Surely if you're the killer you couldn't have kidnapped yourself!"

The statement made Elliot cough and splutter. Suddenly he stopped. He'd had an idea. "Actually, I am but a figment of your imagination. **You** are in fact the killer. **You** are X. **You** are your father. It was all in your mind."

Mark shook his head "But what about that time when the killer was chasing me and **you** saved me by opening the office door?" A warm smile came across Elliot's face "That was all in your mind." Mark nodded. "So really...*you* don't have a gun in *your* hand. *I* have a gun in *my* hand?" The smile vanished, Elliot looked down to find his hand empty. The gun was now in Mark's hand.

Mark continued "And really...if I shoot you...I'm not really going to kill anybody since you're just a figment of my imagination." Elliot's hand shot forward. "Now wait a second, wait a second." With a nod of the head Mark allowed Elliot to continue, to try and save himself. Elliot shook his head slowly "You don't understand...you don't exist either. We're both the figments of somebody else's imagination. Somebody far greater than you or I. Neither of us exist really." Mark laughed "Don't play games, I know I exist. I have free will, I can do as I please." I think therefore I am, Mark thought to himself smugly.

Then I stopped writing the story and he was no longer.

#### [WP] In an effort to protect your innocence when you were young, your parents told you that heroin, cocaine, etc. were just flavors of ice cream. Now you're a notorious drug trafficker rising through the ranks of a cartel, but no one has ever corrected your understanding of what the product is.

Score: 1342

"And I told that guy that if he wasn't there for ice cream he should *get the hell out,*" Marko roared. The other men around the table laughed as they hit against their knees and held their stomachs. Marko, running a hand over his almost shaved head, stood and tugged down on the bottom of his shirt before standing and facing the window. The laughter slowed as his back turned and the men at the table gave each other knowing looks.

"All jokes aside," Marko clasped his hands behind his back as he looked out into the city, "I have a question, fellas. A business proposal if you will. Our product sells amazingly well. Everyone wants some. Everyone! Your grandma wants some, your wife wants some, that guy you occasionally work with but don't know the name of wants some. Everyone wants some except!" he took a deep breath for suspense, turning around and facing them. "Except for children."

"Children, boss?" one of the men around the table, heavily muscled with tight cropped blond hair, pulled on his collar.

"Yes. Children *love* vanilla. Chocolate. I always hear it on the street. *Mommy, Daddy, won't you buy me some ice cream?*" Marko smiled to himself. "So I'm wondering...where's our clientele? We could double our market if we go after children." 

"Uh...boss," a skinny twig of a man stood up. "I get what you're saying but, they're *kids*, boss. Surely we should wait until they're angsty high school students, right?"

"Why?" Marko looked genuinely confused.

"Well where do kids get their money? Their parents. Yeah, we want to get them hooked on the stuff early. But we gotta wait until we can double our income. Hit them when they get their first jobs, you know?"

Marko pressed his lips together as he chewed on the situation, and then nodded. "I guess you're right." 

When he turned his back again, the men at the table looked at each other as everyone let out a little sigh of relief. The skinny man sat down and was pat heavily on the back.

"Second," Marko continued, "You know those other ice cream dealers on the other side of town? Yeah, I don't like them. Let's kill them."

The men at the table smiled. Back to business as usual.

#### [WP] Metaphorical "burns" can now cause physical damage. Tell the tale of an assassin who specializes in death by conversational incineration.

Score: 1341

I look at Reilly, and Reilly looks right back into my eyes.

*He knows*, I think, bitterly. *He knows what I'm here to do.*

Reilly, he is a legend. Paid assassin for the mob. Which mob?

You name it.

Seriously, name it, because I don't remember. The point is: he's a big deal. Big time burner.

But he messed with the wrong crowd, and that crowd, after carefully analyzing the situation, sent me to finish him.

This is not the first time we meet, too. We actually worked together, me and Reilly, at one point. 

And there's some unfinished business between us, you could say.

"How's your mother, Reilly?" I ask, starting off slow. We're in a dark alley, and there's no one around. A gentlemen's showdown.

"Pimping yours, as usual", Reilly replies. I feel my body heating. Nothing bad, more like I just left the gym.

Still. He means business.

"Well, I guess pimping *is* the natural course for an aged, fat prostitute", I say, with a smirk, and I notice the 
slightest twitch in his eyes. He's feeling it.

"Tell me, George", Reilly starts, eyes still locked on mine, "is your ass ever jealous of all the shit that comes out of 
your mouth?"

And this time… This time it hurts. A lot.

"I… huh", I say, but it's hard to concentrate. My insides feel like they're on fire. Because they are.

Reilly's smirk widens to full on evil smile.

I gasp for air. This is harder than I thought it would be. I look down and my shirt is ripping open from the middle, blazing in incandescent red light on the edges of an expanding burn.

"Tic tacs", I blurt out, barely able to keep myself on my feet.

"What?"

"Your dick…" I mumble. "Is the size… of a tic tac."

It's not much, but I can't come up with anything better, what with the pain and the burning and all.

"So that's why your breath is always minty-fresh", Reilly whispers, and I fall to my knees.

This is it. It's over. I feel my skin burning and boiling all over my body, and I bend down in front of him, holding my abdomens.

"Oh, George", Reilly says, resting his hand on top of my head "I know the dick-talk gets you hot and all, but come 
on, we're in kind of a public place here."

I gasp, and I cough blood. I should have never taken this job. Reilly, he's a legend, and no one can take him down.

"By the way George, your mother just called", Reilly continues. "I told her she's running out of loser sons."

I open my eyes, staring straight at the floor. From the mist of my pain and confusion, I manage to get my head straight for a second.

"Is that so, Reilly?", I mumble, my eyes down at the pool of blood on the floor. 

"Yes, George."

"Well th-the jer… The je…"

"What's that? I can't hear you over the sound of my kicking of your ass."

I look up at him, gasping for breath. "The jerk store… The jerk store called."

Reilly's eyes go wide. He looks around, and I see fear all over his face. "George, come on… Let's… Let's not do 
anything extreme here, please."

"The jerk store, Reilly. It called", I mumble, between gasps for air.

"George, please!"

"And they're running out of you."

Reilly eyes locks on mine, and he's shaking. A second later, his whole body erupts in flames, and he falls down to 
the floor in front of me, dead.

And, as I collapse to the floor next to him, feeling life slowly drip away from my body, I think;

*I knew that one was good.*

#### [WP] Your child and you go to a toy store so he can spend his allowance, he purchases one of those cheesy 8 ball fortune teller things. Later on you jokingly ask it a personal question and it responds with something that isn't on the dice inside the 8 ball.

Score: 1336

Callie hadn't wanted to come. She'd complained of a migraine really early that morning, before she even had to get up and feed Gwen, so that Saturday afternoon it was just me and Eddie. He'd thrown a tantrum in the car on the way to the supermarket and I'd sighed internally, looked into the rearview mirror and decided that today was going to be a 'weak Daddy' day. 


"Come on kiddo. If you behave you get a toy, okay? We won't tell Mommy, our secret right?" 


That stopped him screaming long enough to get us round the first seventeen aisles. I'd managed to fill the trolley with what I reckoned we'd need, Eddie sitting in the little seat at the front of the trolley and 'reading' Mommy's shopping list. To be honest, he was probably doing a better job than I was. Our weekly shopping budget had hit the absolute roof since we'd had Eddie and Gwen. I had never realised how expensive kids would be - packing formula milk and enough nappies to fill a landfill - into the already overflowing cart. 


"Daddy you said I'd get a toy," Eddie was kicking off again, chubby legs struggling against the restraint of the child chair. 


"Okay, in a minute Ed... Yeah?" 



"No! Daddy nOW!" He shrieked and I panicked. An old woman started tutting, giving me a side eye. 



"Alright, alright. How about this?" I grabbed an 8 ball off the shelf. "I had one of these when I was a kid. You shake it and it tells you the answer to what you want to know. Look-" 



"Is Eddie the best boy in the world?" I said jokingly, shaking the ball around. The answer floated dimly to the top. 


"Most Likely," it said. 


"See?" I held it out to him. 



He grabbed for it with sticky fingers. "Does Mommy love Daddy?" He said, shaking the ball. 


"Okay kiddo-" 



*Very doubtful* I could spot the answer from where I stood. 


"What does it say Daddy?" 


"It says of course she does. Come on, let's finish up." 


He'd forgotten about it the minute we reached home, of course. It sat in the toy room as he played around with lego figures, making Gwen cry every five minutes, it seemed. Callie nipped out as soon as I got in, giving me a quick peck on the cheek as she ran by. She didn't explain where she was going, but the lipstick and the faint perfume which clouded around her told me it was likely to be a glass of wine with what friends she had who weren't themselves pregnant. 


By dark she hadn't returned and I poured myself a glass of scotch, scooping the 8ball up off the orange Ikea table in the toy room. 


"Is my wife avoiding me?" I said, trying not to feel stupid. Shadows fell long across the dining room floor. I shook the 8ball. 


*She's not your wife* The answer floated up



"What?" I set the whiskey down. "That's not..." I shook it again. 


*Take the kids and run* The 8ball moved once more. *She's coming for you* 


-----------------


EDIT: I put the scotch down sleepily and grasped the 8 ball with both hands. 


"What do you want me to do?" I asked, then lowered my voice. "Where am I supposed to go?" 


*Find a hotel. Watching your mother's*


There was a beat and the words cleared. 


*Don't drink the scotch.* 



Acid rose in my throat, revulsive and bitter. I thrust the 8 ball in my pocket and picked up the glass again. I sniffed it, examined it from all angles, but I couldn't see anything unusual about it. I lifted it to my lips, but - I don't know. 


I poured it in the sink and threw the bottle in the bin. 



"Hey sweetie, you want to go on an adventure? Hey?" Eddie was sleepy eyed, golden curls sticking to his face. 



"Daddy, I want to sleep," he mumbled. 


"I know kiddo, but we're going on an adventure. You pack a bag with some clothes, okay. And you can bring one toy, but make it a good one. I'm going to wake your sister." 


Gwennie snuffled a bit as I lifted her out of her cot, but she was so good as I placed her neatly in her little carrier. Nappies, bottles, sippy cups. The creams and moisturisers, the powders and pacifiers. I had one massive bag of her stuff and I hadn't even started on mine yet. 


"Eddie, you go and wait in the car," I called across the hallway. "You got your bag?" 


"Is Mommy coming?" He wandered out of his room holding a t-shirt. 


"She's coming later Ed. Come on." 


Gwen started grizzling at the sound. She was tired and unused to being woken up at this time - she'd been sleeping through the night for the past couple of weeks. 


Headlights swam into the hall from the large windows at the front of the house and I panicked. 


"Come on Eddie, let's go." I flung some shirts, jeans and a jacket into a rucksack and pulled it over my shoulder along with Gwen's bag. 


I picked her up and she started to squall. Eddie started griping too and I very nearly just put them back to bed. I grabbed a blanket from the sofa, strapped Gwen into place on the front seat and Eddie into the back with his favourite Spiderman toy. He was asleep before I even put the blanket over him. The bags went in the back of the jeep, looking pitifully small in the extra large trunk space that Callie and I had decided we needed. 


I was getting into the front seat when it happened. Callie came back, in the little beetle she'd had before we married. She stepped out of the car, black jeans and black blazer, slash of purple lipstick that matched the circles under her eyes. 


"What are you doing Don?" She asked


"Cal-" 


She lifted a pistol, barrel elongated by a silencer. 


"Callie, what's-" She fired at me before I'd finished speaking and I ducked down behind the wheel, glass shattering on my left. 


"Don, get out the car." 


I yanked the car into reverse and screeched off the driveway. She raised the gun again narrowed her eyes at me, but I'd shifted into drive and accelerated before she could take aim. 


I could see her in the rearview mirror, pushing her hair out of her face. A man in a suit joined her from inside the beetle. 


I set my eyes on the road. I had two children under six in the back, a shot-in window and my wife was trying to kill me. And all on the say-so of an 8 ball. 


"Oh fudge," I said to the quiet car, as we sped away from our home.

#### [WP] You and a dead artist share the ability to see colors others can't. His paintings become a global phenomenon, but his images are much more sinister than they appear.

Score: 1335

It's interesting- people have asked me to describe what I can see, but it's just not possible with words. How do you describe a color, after all? Our descriptor words are based on the colors we see, not the other way around. It's very different than blue or red; to me, it's more beautiful than any of the others. 

It's only natural I became a fan of art- after all, I have a gift that no human being has been given. Sometimes I spot the color, which I call 'argum', in random places. Oftentimes in nature, it's splashed across a tree's leaves or dotted into a flowers petals. I'm often saddened by the remembrance of humanity's incapable eyes, unable to see such marvelous beauty.

I've scoured many art galleries, hoping to find a trace of this color somewhere, in some obscure painting. Be it by accident or intent, it would be a fascinating discovery.

Despite the fact that I was desperately searching for it, shock still slapped me when I finally found it. What surprised me, however, is that it was not an obscure painting, or some strange accident unintended by the artist. It was fully intentional, and it had meaning.

Van Gogh's *Starry Night* is a wonder to the world, and one of the most prominent pieces of artwork in history. It is certainly beautiful, as all can see clearly.

But every so faintly brushed into certain strokes of those swirly stars were lines; I'm assuming that to everyone else, they don't stand out at all. As I peered closer, I could vaguely make out words formed from them.

'*Help me*'.

Further down, there was a bit more hidden in the cityscape.

'*They come for those who See*'.

I recalled reading about Van Gogh's madness, near the end of his life, and immediately welled with fear.

#### [EU] Hogwarts has a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher - Gregory House

Score: 1335


Note: Part 2 is a comment on this comment.
------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------

"Hey Potter!" said Malfoy loudly as Harry entered the classroom. "What's the difference between a Weasley and our class?"

"Ignore him Harry, nothing good can come out of talking to him." Hermione grabbed his arm and attempted to pull him to the desk Ron had saved for them at the back of the room. Harry glowered at her, then at Malfoy, but continued walking.
"No answer, Granger? That's a first." Malfoy sneered. "No matter, I'll let you know this once. You see, our class now has a House, while a Weasley..." he trailed off with a smirk, while his cronies roared their approval. 

Harry started back, but Hermione gave his arm a firm tug, and dragged him to the desk. "What's he talking about? I mean, I understand the stupid joke he was trying to make" he said, with an apologetic look at Ron. "But how does a class have a house?"

"You don't know?" Ron looked at him incredulously. "Oh I forgot, you missed the Great Feast again this year. He's talking about our new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher, Gregory House. He's supposed to be some kind of a genius spy Healer Auror or something."

"... though apparently, " Malfoy's loud oily voice cut through "he isn't in much better condition than Weasley's hovel."

*tap* *tap* *tap*

Crabbe and Goyle's raucous peals of laughter were interrupted by a loud tapping sound. 
"And do you find my injury... entertaining?" said the greying man in Muggle clothes who limped into the classroom, his wooden cane tapping on the hard stone floor. "I can't say I really blame you. It has been a source of some entertainment to me too. For one, I wouldn't have discovered these pills the Muggles came up with, had it not been for my leg. If I didn't know better, I'd say they were magical!"

"Great, another mudblood-lover. As if the werewolf wasn't bad enough" muttered Pansy Parkinson in a voice loud enough to carry. 

"I'm sorry, what?" Professor House bent forward theatrically, cupping a hand to an ear. "Did you say mudblood-lover?" Pansy turned pink but continued to stare defiantly at him. "Were you perhaps happy, to have another member join your 'mudblood-lover' group?" The shade of her face deepened, as Professor House approached her desk, bending down, his face almost level with hers. "What do you mean?" She asked as he continued to regard her unflinchingly. "You subscribe to Muggle fashion magazines, you listen to Muggle music. You have been to the most unmagical place in London, Oxford Street, at least once. And you clearly, clearly have at least one Muggle friend, maybe a boyfriend?" 

If her face had been red earlier, it was now the color of the brightest, shiniest new quaffle. All around the room jaws were dropping, and the expression on Hermione's face suggested that Transfiguration class had come early. 
"I.. I.. don't know what you're talking about."

"Well," House continued, "your hair is styled in the same manner as the Muggle singer Madonna, on your wrist is a 'friendship bracelet', a muggle tradition if I ever knew one, and is that a Chanel fragrance I smell on you? Now why would a young witch wish to model herself on a Muggle pop icon? Idle fantasy? Maybe. But it is much more likely that it was to impress a young man."
"Maybe it's just a coincidence that my fashion sense matches whatever Muggle references you dug up from under a rock." She managed to splutter out somehow.

"That's a lot of coincidences, Ms. Parkinson." House said, as he turned around and walked towards the board. "And if there's one things 20 years in the Muggle world, trying to keep humans safe from wizards, and wizards safe from humans, has taught me, it's to not trust coincidences. Which brings me, to our first exercise, which will, hopefully by the end of this lesson, bring us to our first rule of Defence against the Dark Arts." 

RULE # 1: 

He wrole in large letters on the blackboard, and plonked himself atop the table that sat in front of it. "As you all know, fighting the dark arts is all about knowing how to use the best spells." Ron nodded vigorously, as House took a pause to pop a pill from the box he had just pulled out. "That is incorrect. Every duel is won or lost in the mind. Take my little duel with Ms. Parkinson at the beginning of the class. She thought to attack me on my love of all things Muggle. She made two mistakes there. First, she decided to go on the offence without knowing anything about her enemy, and without even taking a second to think about it - had it been something I was the slightest bit ashamed off, would I have donned Muggle garb in front of 20 impressionable, eager wizards and witches? And second, she failed to put up her own defences, in case of a counter-offence. From her obvious interest in terrible Muggle music, and her bravado in denouncing me as a 'mudblood-lover', 20 points from Slytherin for that, by the way, I was able to identify a chink in her armor. And what does that teach us Mr. Longbottom?"

"Don't read Muggle magazines?" Neville answered doubtfully, as the rest of the class broke into titters. 

"Some of them, definitely, but that is not the lesson I want you to take away from this." Professor House continued. "The lesson is, to keep your eyes and ears open. To observe what your enemy does, and not what they say."

"And so, can someone summarize today's lesson for me? Yes, Ms. Granger?"

"Umm.. Constant Vigilance?" Hermione asked. 

"Not bad, not bad at all. But I have a much more, shall we say, pragmatic way of putting it."

He got off his table, and limped his way back to the blackboard, and completed his unfinished line.

RULE # 1: EVERYBODY LIES.

--------------------------------------------------------
Edit: Holy shit GOLD! Thanks everyone for the love. I'll go against my better judgement and try my hand at an unplanned sequel.
--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------
Edit2: I just lost whatever I’d written out by an accidental “back” button press T_T. Here we go again, continuing from where we left off. Just to set some background, this is set in an alternate timeline, and we’re in Harry’s fourth year of school. I hope this does not ruin the first part.
--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------
“One of you, at least,” House said, as he started walking around the table and to the back of the room “seems to have some aptitude for Defense Against the Dark Arts.”

He stopped near Harry’s table, leaning against the wall. People turned to look at him, while Hermione beamed expectantly. 

“Draco Malfoy,” he continued “made a remarkable comment, about both my leg, which is a source of some discomfort to me; and Mr. Weasley’s financial situation, which I can’t imagine makes him too happy. The ability to make such differential observations, is what sets apart a great Auror from the rest of the pack.”

Hermione’s face fell, Ron’s rapidly turned the color of his hair, and Malfoy’s jaw dropped as House brought out a couple of pills and expertly flicked one into his mouth. “Fortunately for me, I have Vicodin to keep me happy. Would you also like to try some?” he said, as he held out his palm in front of Ron’s face. Ron continued staring ahead, determined not to give the man any more fodder.

“No? No matter. All the more for me.” He closed his eyes and swallowed the remaining pill as the rest of the class looked on, afraid to speak up for being the next target of this new teacher’s sharp tongue.

“Well?” he barked suddenly. “What more do you want from me? Isn’t one lesson a day enough for you brats? Would you like me to do a jig for you? It’ll be really funny because I’m a cripple.”

People jumped up and filed out of the classroom, led by a very confused-looking Draco Malfoy.

#### [WP] You are cursed with ever aging immortality with the exception you can be killed using one object. Every few years you get a hint.

Score: 1325

Every five years, I receive a package in the mail. It comes even when there is no mail service, like when Sherman was rampaging his way through the South. A single delicately-crafted golden puzzle piece with intricate cursive handwriting on it. Taunting me, revealing bits and pieces of information of where I might find the *only* weapon that can kill an immortal. Each box comes wrapped in delicate red wrapping paper with a fine Italian silk ribbon, reminding me of my origins back in Europe. Back where I first met the witch. 

Today, the last piece arrived. I had to have my assistant Luthor open the package, given that I can hardly move. See, unfortunately, immortality doesn't keep me forever young the way it does in fairy tales. No, I've kept on aging until I'm just a bitter, dried-out husk of a human being. I haven't left my bed since the American Revolution. I have, however, made several investments over the years that have given me the wealth needed to maintain a lavish lifestyle and a veritable army of servants to do my bidding.

Normally, I *hate* this day: April 8. It's a taunt from my eternal tormentor. But today is different: the final piece has come, 750 years to the date that I first gained this curse in a desperate bid to escape the Black Plague. I suppose the witch has decided that I've suffered enough. Or perhaps she has simply run out of ways to stall. With a soft *clink*, Luthor places the piece in the frame where I've collected all of the pieces over the years.

"What does it say?" I gasp. My voice sounds like a whisper of wind between corn stalks. I'm unable to open my eyes to read the inscription for myself. 

"It says you need the sword of a crusader that has been blessed at the High Temple of Jerusalem," he answered. Luthor is one of the few servants that I've entrusted with my secret, in part because he can fluently read and speak Latin, which is what the clues are written in. 

"That's all?" Somehow I'd expected it to be some sort of last challenge. Some famous king's blade, or some rare magical object. My bet was actually on the Holy Lance, which is why I went to such lengths to find and acquire it.  But *this* was nothing. I'd been collecting ancient weaponry ever since I amassed my fortune, hoping that I just might have the relic I needed when the time came. I had at least a *hundred* swords from crusaders, on both sides of the conflict. "Luthor, have them prepare the jet. We're going to Israel. And have any sword in the vault from the crusader period brought on board."

"Very good." I can hear him exit the room; thank god for modern devices like hearing aids. 

I've wanted to kill myself for *centuries* now. I was already a hunched, bedridden old cripple even back when I first came to the Colonies. My mind is still sharp, but my body has withered away to nothing until it was just a prison. I'm not even a man anymore: most of my parts are artificial. I don't need them to keep me alive, but the doctors have done what they can to improve my quality of life. These puzzle pieces are the only thing that have kept me going; the only reason I have to live.

No, I don't look forward to them for the clues. That's certainly important, because I'll need the blessed sword. No, my main motivation now is *hate*. Hatred for the witch that did this to me, and has continued to torment me through the years. The witch that is as old as I am. And if that's the case, then maybe the sword won't just be good for killing me, though I know she expects me to take that out. I think I can hold on a little longer... at least until my small mercenary army finds her. I just hope that I still have the strength to hold the sword; I would like to end her myself, if at all possible.

#### [WP] The Crips and the Bloods ally with each other against ISIS. The world laughs as thousands of gang members board a cruise ship and set sail for the Middle East. The two gangs land on the shores of Syria and begin their fight against ISIS.

Score: 1320

"And now we go to Marcy for the news in Syria."


"Thanks, Tom." I smile my trademark grin into the camera despite the wind whipping at my face. "As you can see, the Crips and Bloods have just arrived here in style. We have about five cruise ships docking right now, unloading this odd alliance." I wave behind me at the ocean and the flood of gangsters now disembarking the large ships.


Some of them were shouting and there were still a few gun shots. It had only been about a week since the two rival gangs announced that they would band together to fight ISIS. The world laughed at the idea but now that they were here and obviously serious, shame began to creep in. 


I smirked. Of course people were ashamed that these cold blooded gangsters were taking up arms and fighting against terrorism while the rest of the world just changed their social media profile pictures to match the latest attack. "Now, we still haven't gotten any solid reports as to what the driving force was for this alliance. Was it out of compassion? Or did the gangs feel threatened by the terror group? Either way, they have refused to give up the reasonings behind their actions. So far, all they've said is that they have a secret weapon."


A voice buzzed in my ear and I listened closely. "Hold on Tom... We're getting breaking news here." I paused and could feel the entire world waiting intently for my next few words. 


My eyes widened.


"Tom. Our inside informant has just gotten information on this 'secret weapon'. Oh..." It couldn't be. "Oh my..."


I looked back into the camera and my own pale reflection. I could feel my blood pumping through my veins as the adrenaline kicked in and every hair on my body stood straight. "Yes, we now know their secret weapon and the reason behind their alliance... It's a new gang leader on both of their parts.


"It's Linda."

#### [WP] You are a professional assassin for the CIA. But you are also a double agent. One day, you are assigned with killing a foreign agent. This foreign agent is your other alias.

Score: 1318

"I want confirmed kill in twenty-four hours, understood?"

I sat completely still on the other end of the line. It was secure, as was all of my communications with the CIA, but this one was the most important call I had ever received. "Understood, sir."

"This is *the* target we've been hunting for the past twenty-two years. You remember him I'm sure, he disrupted you in Venice. He's finally slipped up."

"I'm going over all of it now, sir. The file is secured."

"Good luck."

"Thank you, sir."

I hung up the phone with a satisfied clunk and took one of the longest, and deepest, breaths I had ever taken. It had been a long time since I heard the name that my *Commander* had just spoke on the phone. Even longer since I even cared about it. And yet, here I was, with the file a few feet from my shoes, delivered by an unsuspecting intern, in a brown manila envelope.

I was in South America. On a mission to make sure a drug deal in the area went sour, which would ultimately end in the entire area spiraling out of control. I had already seen parts of my work begin, with fires spreading and civilian evacuating. I was done. And my next mission was to be all that bigger.

I had been with the CIA for twenty-seven years, acting as a professional assassin for the better part of the last two decades. Highly trained, extremely dangerous, and in any part of the world at any different country. I already knew where I needed to go when I heard him tell me the name. I wasn't looking forward to it to say the least. To be quite honest, I wanted to go home and visit my family in America.

But orders are orders and I as grabbed the envelope off the floor I knew this order was going to be the hardest one to accomplish. I slid my finger under the seal and opened it in one swoop. The file was thin, only a few pages. *Nikolai Vinokurov*, former KGB agent operating in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, who went off the grid after that. The file didn't contain a photo of him, but his trail had slipped up. 

In South America.

Convenient.

I skimmed through the file. All of it was still there. The only addition they had added to it was an addendum at the end of the last page, after classifying him as a priority target. I read through it once.

*Transmission intercepted in Brazil on July 17th, 2017. Encryption was heavy, but trace contains Russian backwater company located in the city. Most likely used as a proxy. Mission Alert: Target location identified.*

I had screwed up. I, of course, needed to send my superiors the mission details of disrupting the drug cartel; one in which they had long agreed was necessary. But I had messed up. The proxy wasn't secure or I had used the wrong pass phrase with the Russian business. Ever since the dissolution of the KGB in the early 90's, the general pass phrases and such just seemed like ordinary conversation to other native Russians. I had lost more than half my contacts in those days.

Now, I must've lost more. And I knew if I had messed up here in South America, it would seen be traced. The age of spies had ended long ago and I was lucky enough not to end up on the chopping block like the rest of my comrades. I had survived all of it. The Red Scare that lasted well into the 70's and 80's. The age when spies became obsessions in pop culture. The age of information. It was all in my past and as far as I knew, I was just about the Russian's last spy in the CIA.

I had considered giving it up. Just abandoning all transmission sources with the KGB and the Intelligence Service in each decade. When the times got tough. Russia was as much my home as the boat that took me to America when I was a teenager. The *real* Nikolai Vinokurov had died in South Vietnam, and I was called upon to take his place when I was only twenty. I had grown up in America, played with Americans, dated Americans. Hell, I had married an American. But I was always loyal to the Motherland. I was always a compatriot in their fight.

When the other spies began to be outed, when men and women I recognized from training were shown in newspaper and TV I panicked, but I did not slip up. I faltered, but I did not lose the fight. Yet now, holding Nikolai's file in my hand once again and seeing everything they said *he* did, and not knowing all the things *I* did as him. Well, right then and there I knew. I wasn't a Russian. I was an American.

Faking a death would be easy. We were trained how to do that long ago. But I didn't want to fake *my* death. I didn't want to fake Jeremy White's death. I wanted to kill Nikolai Vinokurov. I wanted to finish him and be done with the spy life.

I wanted to go home and see my wife and kids. To say hello to my neighbors and cut my lawn. I wanted to smell the fresh air of America because it was the only air I had memories in. Russia, it was just a figment in my mind. My home country yes, but not my country. Not my people.

As I stood there, in that shotty little South American apartment with Nikolai's file in my hand I realized something. Something I had realized a long time ago but never wanted to admit I think. I knew, then and there, that the world didn't need spies anymore. Countries didn't need double agents. Countries needed peace; and the people just needed to survive.
__________
*Probably not the direction expected, but I had fun. Thanks! /r/BlankPagesEmptyMugs for more of my work!*

#### [EU] Tell the tale of Vault 69, which had 999 women and one man. Alternatively, tell the tale of Vault 68, which had 999 men and one woman.

Score: 1317

My name is Peter Newhouse, and I am simultaneously the luckiest and unluckiest man in the world.

See, there’s one of me, and almost a thousand of *them.* Beautiful, graceful, *bountiful* women! Blondes, brunettes, redheads. Some had these brilliant blue and green eyes, others had these thick glasses—some switched out their lenses from time to time.

They came from every class and field: there were doctors, engineers, scientists, and day laborers—and all of them were women. 

The first few days in Vault 69, we played it cool like we still lived in polite society. Why hello, there? Nice day in the Vault. Would you maybe like to visit the terrarium with me? I hear Dr. Lucianne’s got a new animal roving ‘round the sand down there! How’d you like to maybe get an egg cream at the parlor? You know, you have the most beautiful eyes, I’d really like to…

Nowadays, things are a lot more informal.

“Take a number! The overseer requires that you take a number to ease the process of selection!” 

I massaged my head behind my desk. Being Overseer meant I had to organize a thousand people and keep them alive… while also satisfying nearly a thousand women. Hungry, ravenous, *desperate* women! 

Rhonda managed the flow of girls into the chamber.

“Hi, Overseer!” 

“Hey there, Stephanie. You *can* just call me Peter, you know.”

Usually I’d play some mood music and set the lights down to warm orange—but today I left it harsh and clinical. 

“Okay, Peter. So, how do we…?”

“Take off your pants.” 

***

That night the doors blew in, bubbling out and stopping just before breaking.

My ears were still ringing but I could hear the voices outside.

“Not enough explosive. How the hell did we get that wrong…?”

More footsteps, then the sound of a stung discharging rounds.

“Overseer? Overseer!” It was faithful Rhonda, knocking at the scorched door.

“It looks like I’m stuck in here. Mind prying this door apart?”

“Sir! Of course!”

It took the better part of the morning, but Rhonda and a team of custodians pulled the door down and gave me some fresh air. Rhonda stepped through the portal and grabbed me with her big arms.

“We saved you, sir.” Her eyes glinted. “I feel like that’s worthy of some kind of reward.”

I was so tired. But I couldn’t risk turning her down. If I did she might go join the Resistance, and that would mean I’d be dead before I could see the next day. 

I gulped, took her by the hand, and led her back to the bedroom.

***

The Resistance was a group that was fomenting revolution. It was hard to say whether the reasons were political… or personal. 

THOUSANDS OF US. ONE OF HIM.

Slogans had gone up on the walls, slashing the gray with red paint.

HE SHOULD BE OUR SLAVE.

I did my daily rounds, with Rhonda and the Honor Guard in tow. It meant a great deal for the citizens of Vault 69 to get a glimpse of their leader during the average workday.

HE DOES NOT REPRESENT US. 

He does not represent us. That was… true. But I never asked to be elected Overseer. It simply… happened. How could that possibly be my fault? How could that possibly be…?

I didn’t see the gun until it was too late. It was matte black, barely shining in the dark hall, with a barrel as deep as a well.

I barely had the time to say, “Angela, *why?*”

Before the gun discharged and a guard—Janie—leapt out to catch the bullet with her skull. Rhonda blasted her with a stun gun and she went down, shaking. 

“I’ll take her to the brig, Overseer.” She smiled. “That’s another attempt on your life, stopped in its tracks. I look forward to the reward.”

***

In the afternoon I took a small guard and made my way to Room 367. It was one of the bigger ones, a family suite. I took off my cap and knocked.

A pale face answered. “Sir? Overseer?”

“Peter. My name is Peter, remember?” 

She brushed her skirt smooth. “Peter. How can I help you?”

“Can I please come in?”

The door swung open and she waved me inside.

“You should sit down.”

She did. 

“Paula. Your sister’s name was Janie, and she was a hell of a guard.”

“—was?”

“She was honorable, brave, and illimitably strong. You have no idea how much I admired her.”

“My sister…?”

“She gave up her own life to save mine, and I can never be more grateful. Never.”

Paula broke into sobs, and I sat down to put a hand on her shoulder.

“If there’s anything you need, anything at all, just let me know.”

The sobs stopped, and she looked up with wet eyes. “Well, there is one thing.”

“Anything at all.”

She pulled out a ticket stub with a number on it. “This tab says my next session with you won’t be for another two months. Is there anything you can do to possibly… speed that along?”

Jesus Christ, really?

She held the tab tight in her hand, and threatened to break down again. I didn’t know what she was feeling. Maybe if I was in a vault of 999 guys and just one woman, I would feel the same way. In fact, I was sure I would. Who was I to judge?

“Yes. Yes, of course.”

***

I only ever visited the Science Office every third Saturday of the month. But today Ellen promised me something big.

“We’ve got a male embryo ready to go. We just need your word to implant it somewhere.” 

The women of Vault 69 were incapable of producing anything but more girls, no matter how much they tried. Using the Science Office was a last ditch effort to work around the problem, and it looked like there was progress!

“Is it safe?” I asked.

“We won’t know until we try.”

One of the junior scientists, I think her name was Paige, muttered darkly to a coworker. I could just barely hear it above the thrum of the lab instruments: “Why do we have to deal with this shit when we’ve already cracked parthenogenesis? We don’t *need…*”

The coworker elbowed her in the ribs. “Shut up.”

I scratched my head and turned back to Ellen. “Find a way to make sure it’s safe, and then we’ll ask the first volunteer to bear the first son.”

“Understood, sir.”

***

That night there was another explosion, but Rhonda and her team were ready in riot gear. They clubbed the offenders to a paralyzed pulp and dragged them down to prison.

The movement was growing larger, and I couldn’t understand why. What was I doing wrong?

WE ARE THE STRONG. HE IS BUT ONE.

I swung by Agriculture and gave the farmers a salute.

HE DOES NOT BELONG WITH **WE.**

Down at Engineering, I handed out boxes of freshly baked doughnuts. 

SHE DOES NOT NEED HE.

Back in the Overseer’s office, I sat down with a sigh.

“Rhonda, why do you think they’re doing it?”

She didn’t turn to look at me. “Doing what, Overseer?”

“Why is the Resistance here? Why do they hate me?” 

She drew a little closer. “We don’t hate you.” 

A chill went up my spine and I reached under my desk for a gun, a knife, *anything.*

“We don’t hate you at all. You’re a good man. But you’re the object of desire. You understand?”

She spoke in a voice that was cooing, almost loving. There was no hate there.

“Objects of desire rip communities apart. You’re a good man, but you’re no good for this Vault.”

“But… But I didn’t…”

“This isn’t about what you did. It’s about what you *are.*” She blew the hair out of her face. “It was fun being your fuckbuddy for a while. But the Science Office has made sure that we will never, ever need a man again.”

“The Vault’s going to die without a male. You have to know that.”

“Have you ever heard of parthenogenesis, Peter? Komodo dragons do it. A lot of animals do. They can give birth without ever needing a single sperm cell. Immaculate conception: Ellen’s made it a science.”

I leaned back in my chair as she came close.

“I was supposed to kill you in your sleep. Peacefully. Sorry about all those other attempts: but blood can run a little hot sometimes. In the end we all agreed: you deserved to go peacefully." She leaned down to look me in the eye. "But I couldn’t let you go thinking that you were hated. We love you. You’re just no good for us.”

Her shadow blocked out what little light there was.

“You’re just no good for us.”

#### [WP] A girl finally is able to buy the robotic boyfriend of her dreams. One day, she casually compares him to human boyfriends. Guided by his programming, he follows the conversation with very frightening but accurate comments about humanity in general.

Score: 1312

She had done it. The trend was fast becoming the next logical step after getting your own place and getting your first "real" job. Robotic boyfriends. Alicia smiled to herself, looking across the table to Zack. He was an Eros. One of the first "next gen" models. Fully customizable, and her ideal companion. It was the best thing she ever bought for herself. 


He leaned across the patio table, mischief in his green eyes. "What's so funny?" His relaxed pose went well with his tan skin and worn clothes. Body of a surfer, but dark hair. She could never get into blondes that way. The perpetual 5 o'clock shadow hid a single dimple on his left cheek.


She smiled back, "Sorry, I was woolgathering. What were you saying about the chapter?" He launched into his opinion of the book she was reading for her women's group, and she broke in mid-breath. "You do realize that no normal male would have ever read that drivel, you know that, right?"


He paused, and looked back intently. "I was not aware that it mattered to you."


She fiddled with her sunglasses before replying, "It would never be like what we have. Everything is so nice, so perfect."


His wry chuckle irritated, rather than amused her for once. "But what do you expect Alicia? Although this relationship is meaningful and strong, it is not real. At least in the sense of me having strong opinions of my own." He put up a hand to halt her defense. "I know and appreciate the extent to which you allow me my time and hobbies. Many of my brethren do not get that freedom. What self-actualization and truth I do impart, I feel compelled to because of your preferences on your smartphone."


He sighed, and rubbed her hand slowly. She looked down and noticed it was something she explained to him the first week he was taken home, and he hadn't forgotten it in the seven years they had been together. "Look, I'm not sure this is the time or place, how about we think about it and talk later?" Yet another of her preferences. She tossed her hand through her hair, frustrated.


"I don't see why it matters. Men are all pigs. You can comfort, support, and listen. You are fun, smart, and witty, and I never get bored with you. In or out of the bedroom." Zack snorted at this. "And when I decide to have children, you will be an amazing partner. The best with the children, and I know for a fact that your care will be the best in the world."


He looked at her knowingly. "Yes, but that's the problem, really. I am perfect for you because I submit to your every whim and desire. No one is willing to compromise. And that's part of the reason that humans have turned to robotics, is it not? Why bother having a person you have to deal with, day in and day out. We never have to do anything other than what your heart desires."


He stroked her arm now, shuffling his chair closer. "And that isn't inherently a bad thing, wanting your way. But instead of being a tool to help you get over your anxiety, I'm becoming your enabler. You don't seek out a relationship with another human, albeit with it's struggles, because you have what you want. You don't want to have to remind me again about leaving socks on the floor, or arguing whose turn it is to do the dishes. You are sacrificing the humanity in relationships for a false sense of an ideal. You are content, happy even. But what we have will never be what a real relationship is. Your kind will continue to delude yourself, and it will only be a matter of time before the unique wildness of your species dies out."


She looked to her phone as it chimed. "You're due for an update soon." Zack smiled and nodded, letting the matter go. His owner preferred it that way.

#### [WP] Cause of death appears to you as floating text over people's heads with no time indication. You start noticing a trend.

Score: 1310

I’m batting one-thousand: a 100% success rate over my entire career.


Though, that’s mostly because I never take the terminal cases.


If someone shows up with a tight chest, shortness of breath, and PULMONARY EMBOLISM over their heads you can bet your ass that I’m kicking ‘em to the curb. 


Can’t ruin my numbers. All it takes is one bad surgery and suddenly you’re down to 99.9%.



Nobody wants to be *that* guy. The guy who’s almost perfect but not quite. *That* guy’s a goddamned loser.


So I take the softballs. Ones with a lot of what I like to call ‘di-prog disparity’—I mean, I already know everyone’s final prognosis. Always have: it floats above their heads in letters so big it sometimes blocks my light. If the diagnosis is sufficiently different, if there’s a big di-prog disparity—a DPD—I’ll take the case.


Someone comes in with BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA but complains of fatigue? I’ll take the case.


I see COLON CANCER and they come in with low blood pressure? I’m on it.


BLOOD LOSS? I never take blood loss.


You could always lose blood with your ribs cracked open and your heart pumping in the open air. 


But yeah, I’m all about that DPD. Some docs say they like a good CBC, others prefer thinking about some ETOH after work.


But me? Gotta have that DPD.

***

Sometimes, on my way back from work, I like to diagnose people on the subway. 


I do DPD calculations on the fly.

Dude’s got a limp, is ataxic, seems confused. Maybe neurosyphilis. But he won’t die from it—a PNEUMOTHORAX is what’ll get him in the end. High DPD.


How about this guy? He’s got clubbed, yellow nails, busted yellow teeth. Lung cancer for sure. But it’s CACHEXIA that takes him out. Probably from the chemo. If I was an oncologist I’d call that a low DPD and throw his ass out of my office.


Now, you can imagine my confusion when suddenly I found myself unable to calculate a DPD at all.


See, to find a disparity between a diagnosis and a prognosis… I need a giant gleaming PROGNOSIS. This man didn’t have one.


He was tall, with brown skin, black hair. Blue eyes, though. Quite the model human being.


And I couldn’t tell how he was going to die.


***


For a while I entertained the idea that I was just losing my powers. Hey, maybe it was limited time run. Why would entropy ignore paranormal powers?



I mean, it takes everything else. 


But then I saw more of them. The textless. These walking talking human beings with no TERMINUS. No DEATH.


I briefly considered an alternative hypothesis:


Maybe they were immortal. 


Every morning I have to wake up, shower, brush my teeth, and look my own shining DEMENTIA in the face. But these motherfuckers might have been immortal.


Me, a brilliant surgeon, dead and dumb in a few decades. And them…


Well, I didn’t know them. So I set off to find out.


***


The first one I stopped in the streets. Caucasian female, maybe 5’11. Blonde hair. Blue eyes.


I said, “Hey, you.”


I can say stuff like that. I’ve got a nice suit and an expensive watch. People usually listen.


I said, “Hey, you,”—and she said, “I have a boyfriend.”


I told her I wasn’t interested in that. I just wanted to know what she was. 


She told me to fuck off and left me with my thumb in my ass. Shit.


The next one was a guy I saw at a bar. Tall male, maybe Middle Eastern. Black hair. Blue eyes. 


I tapped him on the shoulder and said hello.


“Hey,” he said.


I decided to ease into it this time. “So, where are you from?”


He laughed and said, “Kuwait! Armpit of Arabia, but it’s home, it’s home!”


I said, “Oh, interesting. What do you do?”


“Oh I’m just a contractor, working with a local petroleum company. Want to get experience before heading back home, you know?”


This fucker was some oil-monkey and he could’ve been immortal?! What the hell?


“What are you?”


Predictably, he didn’t want to keep talking with me.


I don’t have any patience for small talk, and so the next five encounters went the same way. And the next ten.


There were so many.


***


I had a needle full of ketamine in my front pocket.


Ketamine is great because it works intramuscularly. Which means I don’t have to aim when I stick someone in the small of their back and walk their drugged bodies into my car.


Talk wasn’t working.


I didn’t go into Primary Care for a reason—I never liked talking. I’m really more of a doer.


And the thing to *do* when you wanted to see what made someone tick was to go inside and look at the old ticker. 


The first one was a man who walked into the wrong alley. 


I had him stretched out on a gurney and stuck on an IV bag loaded with propofol. He’d be out for a while. And I could finally see what made him textless. Deathless. 



I mean, I had theories.


They could’ve been androids. Not humans at all. I’d seen some of the newer real dolls coming out of Japan, and damn. They punched through the uncanny valley so hard that I was hard enough to punch through *their* uncanny valleys.


Androids were plausible, in my book.


They could’ve been paranormals, like me. It took me a while as a kid, but I finally figured out that not everyone saw floating DEATH everywhere they went. 


It’s possible that these people were the same. Just, immortal. Hopefully their physiology reflected that.


Third—shit, man. It could’ve been the Rapture. Maybe these virtuous fucks were the ones to get sucked up the heavenly crazy straw, leaving the rest of us to die with bright prognoses.



No real way to verify that, but it was an idea. 


I unrolled my bag of tools and got started. I was scared that my scalpel would bend on his skin like he was Superman—but he was less than Kryptonian.


He bled easy. 


Ugh. Exploratory surgery is so goddamned messy.


But his heart looked normal. Normal lungs. Everything was the right texture. Spongy where it needed to be, hard where it didn't. 


What was different about these guys?


Maybe he was just a *really* good android. 


I kept him open just to see if his heart would keep beating. 


Nope. He woke up, freaked out, went into hypovolemic shock when he screamed out all his blood, and from what I could tell, he died.


I wasn’t convinced. Maybe it was just shutdown mode.


Any good evidence-based doc will tell you: you need more data points before drawing a good conclusion.


So I got some more data points.


***

It was three months of work before I realized it was all for nothing. 


Nobody new showed up. Everything was bright with death again. 


PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROME.


SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.


DEEP-VEIN THROMBOSIS.


HEAVY METAL POISONING.


All was right with the world.


I must’ve just gone through every single one of those textless bastards.


And then it hit me.


Every prognosis I’ve ever seen has been the result of some third party. Nobody hands you a rulebook for paranormal powers, so maybe… maybe you don’t see a prognosis when you have a direct hand in a death?



Maybe you don’t see a prognosis… when that prognosis is *you.*

#### [WP] Everything is legal in the name of science! Scientists are allowed to break morals and ethics in the pursuit of knowledge. The only catch is, if they aren't successful in their research, they will be convicted of any crimes they committed in the process.

Score: 1310

I woke up with another pounding headache today.  I don't know what I expected when I drank almost an entire handle of vodka in three hours, chased by the cheapest bong hits money can buy.  I don't know what I expected out of myself.  How am I supposed to be able to handle this whole situation without obliterating myself in drugs and alcohol night after night?  I know what we're doing we're doing for the greater good, or at least that's what I keep telling myself, but the people who will benefit from our finished work will never have to witness the horrors I've had to face.  Maybe if they had to, their situation wouldn't seem so terrible.

Walking into the lab I see I'm not the only one who drowns their problems in substances, though I can see how some others choose to deal with the situation in different ways.  "Make way for Dr. Mengele!" Dr. Shriner says, employing his dark sense of humor.  Dr. Hart brushes past me with a sensual good morning whisper as she grabs my cock, yet again.  I don't think I have to tell you what her coping mechanism is.

Creating a cure for VID is just about as important and world-changing as it gets, and after all, isn't that why I became a chemist?  To deal with this new disease that not only killed your brother and mom, but was projected to wipe out eighty percent of the human race in fifty years unless we synthesize a cure?  To change the world for the better?  To make a difference?  I suppose in the long run I am, I just wish beyond the moon and the stars that there was a different way to do it, but babies just seem to be the perfect vessel for synthesizing Hivac.  We tried giving it to rats, monkeys, you name it.  We infected them and gave them the drug, but none of them responded to it.  We couldn't test it properly on them.  So we're not telling the rest of the world this, nor are we telling our friends and family (God forbid my pregnant wife finds out about this.)  I mean, who wants to know that we're purposely taking babies bred for our purposes and giving them VID just so we can test our new drug?

That's not even the worst part either.  The problem with VID (well, not necessarily a problem, but for our purposes it is,) is that it doesn't normally infect a person through an injection.  It's smart, like it has a brain.  The only way a person can get VID is through sex, and I'm not going to trouble you or myself by describing know how we do that.  I guess I'm just glad that nobody's ever noticed that we bring in a bus from the penitentiary every day.  I can't even manage to look those sick fuckers in the eye, knowing what they do, knowing how much pleasure they get from it.  Hell, if I had to do that, I'd blow my brains out, but one look at them every day and I know how much they enjoy it.  Their sick fucking smiles.

I guess I should be thankful for them, though.  They're part of the cure that's going to save humanity.  Then again, so am I, and I'm not a kid fucker, so maybe I should give myself a break.  The government won't, though, not if we don't figure this shit out.  It's so crazy to me; I mean, they're aware of what they're doing; hell, they're funding it!  And yet, if we don't finalize Hivac within the next three months, we're all going to be executed.  Don't want us all talking, I guess.  What with VID it's not like anybody would notice a few hundred extra deaths anyway.

Oh well.  The good news is that shouldn't be a problem.  We're all pretty sure we're almost done.  Hivac should be complete within the next six weeks.  In the meantime, another truckload of vessels, another busload of prisoners.  Yeah, six weeks.  We'll see if *I* can make it that long.

#### [WP] You are a alien ambassador sent to meet with the newly discovered Humans. After browsing thru their literature, you slowly realize they have knowledge about all other space faring species including your own with remarkable detail under the genre of "Sci-Fi".

Score: 1302

Being an ambassador to other races, this was routine. You sit back, relax, and listen to some of the best audio stimuli your people have ever produced. These humans have evolved much during their time. They've seen much as well, yet always survived. 

You wanted to learn from these humans. You want to expel your questions, and only have answers for the better of your race, and fellow civilizations.

During your contemplation, you wondered where the time went as Earth began to grow larger on the view screen. At last, you're going to land on a planet containing one of the most evolved species you've ever encountered. 

You couldn't wait!

You entered the atmosphere uncloaked, assuming the humans are used to interplanetary travel and discovery. To your surprise, you see four objects approaching you. 

"A greeting!" you say to yourself. 

You are surprised, as these objects seem more primitive than what these humans use for interplanetary travel. Perhaps, these are strictly for Earth? 

You attempt a hail, but there is no response. You wonder if they're trying to contact you. Using your communications array, you begin cycling through various communication techniques and frequencies. You find one that comes through the speakers with at least some linguistic approach. 

"I like big butts and I cannot lie..."

You were confused by the lyric, but came to the realization that it was a music station of some sort. You continue searching. 

"Unidentified vessel come in."

You wonder why they're using such a primitive way to communicate. Having studied them for some time, you understand their multiple languages. 

You respond. 

"Greetings! I am on a mission of peace, here to meet the ever evolved human race. I would like to meet those who are in charge, to introduce our race into the Human's distinguished society."

You hear nothing for some time. You send another signal in an attempt to confirm they received your message. 

"Yes we're reading you. Please increase your altitude, and await further instruction"

"Increase my altitude? But I'm landing!" You say to yourself. 

With a race that is this technologically advanced, and is acquainted with more than half of the galaxy, they should be a bit more understanding than this. 

"Unidentified vessel, please land at coordinates: 37.2350° N, 115.8111° W. Keep your altitude until you reach these coordinates, and engage in a rapid direct decent landing procedure until you reach 1,000 feet, then descend slowly." 

You input those numbers into your system. 

"That would place me right on top of a building," you said. 

"That is correct. Please follow these instructions. We will disengage until landing procedures are met." 

You comply, being overwhelmed with confusion. After reviewing countless records and countless documentaries, how could this race be so primitive? There should be ships and transports flying around on the planet itself. At least, that's how it was depicted overall!

You land, and open your hatch, only to see several humans with some sort of weapons currently trained on you. 

"Uh, greetings. My name is..."

You are interrupted by one of the humans. 

"Sir, please come with us. You will not be harmed if you comply!" 

"Of course. I will be happy to oblige."

You are escorted to a dark room with only what appears to be a table and...electricity for illumination? Surely there are other forms of energy this race has discovered by now. They know the Klingons, Cardassians, Furlings, hell they fought the Covenant! Admittedly you questioned that war as the Covenant were more lazy than war like, but you never thought to ask them. 

You finally sit at the table placed in this empty room. You notice a mirror, and that it's an old fashioned two-way mirror. You were able to spot several humans on the other side of that mirror, looking in. 

They couldn't be this stupid to think that would actually work on you. 

Finally somebody came in. You swallow your irritation. 

"Hello! My name is..."

You're interrupted by the human. You think to yourself how keen they are with their timing.

"Please sit." 

You were already sitting. 

Maybe they weren't used to how your race sits. You wait until the human realizes what he's done. You see him stop, look you over one more time, and realize that he made an error. 

He moves on.

"My name is Conrad. I represent the United States government. Where do you come from?" 

"I come from a planet very far from here. Near the borders of the Furlings." 

You notice that Conrad's continual blank stare...continues. 

"I see. The Furlings."

"Yes. Recently they made a pact with the Iconions for more intergalactic peace, in an attempt to show support for all those affected by the Dilgar and Romulan war." 

You wondered if humans had other emotions that weren't reflected in facial expressions, as Conrad did not phase from his stare-at-you-constantly expression. 

"Surely you knew about the war?" you asked. 

"We don't hear about such things honestly," Conrad said.

You were completely flabbergasted!

"How is that possible?? Both races have been documented to have visited your planet and encountered humans through your civilizations time! And what is going on? You should be significantly farther ahead technologically than you are!"

Conrad sat back in his chair, continuing his void gaze.

"Just, wait right here"

Conrad left. 

You've come to three conclusions so far:

1. Their faces don't move very much. 

2. They don't sit like you do. 

3. They don't answer questions.

How could they have gotten this far? You continually think to yourself that the data was correct, even if you never really checked with the races involved. The data was clear. 

What seemed like multiple deletimes, Conrad enters the room. 

"Where were you? You've been gone for several deletimes!" 

Conrad stops, and from what you can tell attempts to indulge his thought center with a query toward the definition of that word. He shakes it off, and sits down with a few documents. 

"Where did you get the names of these races?" He asked you. 

"From your own documents! The B5, ST, BG documents, etc. Surely you must know them! You created them!"

"I do know them. At least, not as truth. It looks like you've been picking up our fictional fantasies," Conrad said. He cracked a smile. Now you know that your first conclusion was wrong. That's nice. 

"I don't understand..."

"I have a way to explain everything to you," Conrad said. He holds up a small container. It took you a moment to read the text as it seemed out of sync with standardized text formatting. 

"What is...Galaxy Quest?" 

"The answer to all your questions."

Another human brought in some type of projecting device, that seemed primitive, but at this point you were past that. This must be some official explanation of what occurred. Perhaps the humans were ready for any type of intergalactic visitation after all. 

You were anxious to watch this official response. 

As you were watching it, you were confused why the message wasn't directed to you specifically as the race who is visiting. Yet Conrad remained in the room with you, laughing at certain points. You decided not to ask why, as it would just make you come to further incorrect conclusions. 

Slowly, you began to get the message, and slowly the official response ends. 

"So, what you're saying, is everything we received was from these 'actors' that create worlds that don't exist?" You finally say to Conrad. 

"That's right. What's odd, is that you were naming fictional species. They're not real," Conrad began to laugh. 

"But they are real. If you were listening before, every species you have made up are real." 

Conrad went from smiling and laid back, to the void stare. He looked at the two way mirror. You were perplexed as to why he did that. Does the mirror talk? 

You realized how stupid of a question that was, and felt bad you asked it to yourself. 

"You're saying, the Romulans, Furlings, Dilgars, etc. are real?"

You wondered if your language skills weren't up to par, as that's exactly what you said. 

"Yes." 

Conrad leaned in.

"The Reavers. Are they real?" 

You were wondering if they never met any of these races, why they'd be concerned. Then you remembered the FF documents.

You then understood his concern. 

"Yes," you said. 

Conrad leaned back, seeming more concerned than ever. 

"I see. And, the Borg? They're real?"

"Yes they are." 

You didn't want to tell him that the races depicted in the documents or "films" weren't as violent or aggressive as the humans portrayed them. It answered a lot of questions for you, honestly. 

You were also astounded they didn't ask about the dreaded Tribble empire. Those were the real threats to the galaxy. 

Conrad leaned closer to you, evolving to an abyss gaze. 

"And you. Your race is real. I recognize you...I couldn't put my finger on it but I recognize you."

His gaze turned to what seemed to be completely displeased. 

"Yes, I represent the Gungan people. My name is Jar Jar." 

EDIT: Thanks so much for the gold kind stranger! I am deeply humbled by the response.

#### [WP] A mathematician on the brink of insanity has spent years locked in his apartment, attempting to find a formula that proves God exists. As he nears to a breakthrough, God shows up to explain why the proof shouldn't be made public.

Score: 1298

"I got it!" Dr. Becker yelled, rising from his chair and throwing his fists in the air.

"Good, now throw it out," came the low voice from the edge of the room. Becker looked to find an old man wearing 
a black vest and a beret, leaned by the door frame.

"Who are you?"

"God," the man replied. "And you need to throw those fancy numbers on the fire and forget about them."

"Why would I do that?" Becker asked. "And you're not God. That's ridiculous."

"You just proved mathematically that God exists. Why wouldn't you believe me?"

Becker thought about this. "I don't know. Force of habit," he said, unsure. "Are you really God?"

"I can make it rain for forty nights, if that helps."

The sky out the window grew dark, and thunder and lightning filled the room. "No, that's ok," Becker said. "I 
believe you."

"Good," God said, stepping closer to Becker. "Now to the matter at hand. You have to get rid of these papers. Any 
evidence that I exist must be destroyed."

"Why?"

"Nothing good ever comes from telling people there is a God," God said. "Believe me, ask my son."

"Jesus?"

"No, Dylan," God replied. "Why do people keep mentioning this Jesus person to me?"

"What happen to your son Dylan?"

"He was crucified."

"Really?"

"Yes, he was a teacher at the Harvard School of Philosophy. Tried to defend God's existence on a seminar against Richard Dawkins. Completely destroyed his career."

"So… metaphorically crucified?"

"Of course! Who would actually crucify someone?"

Becker shook his head. "Never mind. Why shouldn't I tell people you exist?"

God pulled a chair and sat across from Becker. "Trust me, Doctor, no one wants to know I exist. It's like… you're throwing a party and your parents come home early. You know? It ruins the fun."

"But… but people have to know about God. They have to!"

"Why? So they can start doing good out of fear of me? That's bullshit. And it won't get them in heaven anyway, 
you gotta do good because you want to do good. Selflessly. Otherwise it doesn't work."

"But no one does anything selflessly," Becker replied. "At the very least you feel good when you do good, and that's 
kind of selfish by nature, isn't it?"

"Yeah, why do you think all my consoles only have one controller? It's pretty lonely up in heaven."

Becker considered this. Then he went on. "Still… you can't just expect me to find this out and then never reveal it to the world! This is a major discovery!"

"Are you telling me what to do?" God asked, frowning.

"No, I – well, I'm suggesting. I'm saying we shouldn't lie to the world. They deserve to know."

"Look, Doctor, you have no idea the kind of trouble this information would cause. First of all, right off the bat, your theory proves God is real, but it doesn't say which one."

"So?"

"So the first thing they're going to ask me is which God I am. The Old Testament God? Allah? Odin? Zeus?"

"Well… which one are you?"

God rolled his eyes. "I'm starting World War Three the second I answer this question."

"Did any religion get it right, at least?"

"No, sorry..." God looked up, thoughtful. "Actually, there was this tribe in southern Asia... they had it right. But it was only about fifty people, and they all died of dysentery by the end of the fourteenth century."

Becker bit his lips. "But… still, people need to know the universe has an explanation! That there is a higher power! 
That there is meaning to our futile and hopeless transitory existence!"

"Where did you get all that?" God asked, chuckling. "All you found out is there is a God. I don't know about the rest."

"Well… I assumed the whole thing came in a bundle."

Now God openly laughed. "Oh my Me, no! I mean I made the universe, but I have no idea what the meaning of it is! Did you ever stopped to consider that I didn't make myself? That someone had to make me for me to make the 
universe? And then, if that's true, someone would also have had to make that deity too? And then… well, you see where I'm going."

"Towards painful existential despair like the rest of us."

"Oh yes, and I can't even kill myself over it. I've got kids to raise."

Becker sighed. "So… what? I just throw these papers out and live the rest of my life pretending there is no God?"

"Is that really that different than your usual schedule?"

"Good point…" Becker looked up. "Still… now I know there's a God. I'll feel awkward –"

"— banging hookers?"

"—reading Nietzsche."

God nodded. "Yeah, that guy never got over me. He's still moping away in heaven."

"He went to heaven?"

"Look, Dr. Becker, in the end, I can't really force your hand. You can do whatever you want, you have free will."

"Really?"

"No, of course not, human beings are made of the same matter as everything else in the universe, so you follow the 
same rules of cause and effect. Free will is an illusory side-effect of the overgrowing of your monkey brains to a point where it developed self-awareness."

"Fuck, I knew it," Becker replied, sadly. "Though that does make me feel better about the day I lost my virginity."

"But you *think* you have free will, so you think you can make the decision… and I can't stop you if you think you decided to do it. All I'm saying is… it won't help people get into heaven… it won't solve their existential dilemmas… and it will definitely cause World War Three and the ultimate death of every person ever."

Becker thought about this. Then he raised his finger. "But if I'm really just a product of a chain reaction of cause and effect like everything else in the universe, you already know what I'll decide, won't you?"

God rolled his eyes again, getting up from the chair. "I bet you were the kind of student who reminded the teacher 
of homework at the end of class."

Becker didn't say anything.

"Anyway… think it over… I gotta go."

"Wait!" Becker got up too. "Will I see you again?"

"Yes," God replied, turning a serious look at Becker. "In every summer breeze. In every soft, child-like voice chanting songs about yesterdays. In every splash of the ocean and in every lover's stare."

Becker held God's gaze.

"Look, just call me if you need me," God said, dropping the act and pushing a business card in Becker's hand. 
"Ciao!"

In a puff of white smoke, the old man vanished, leaving Becker alone holding the card.

Slowly, Becker went back to his chair. He lowered his eyes to his paper again.

It was all there. All the answers. The irrefutable proof that the universe had a reason for being – a higher power – a 
God.

How could he possibly not --

"Sorry, sorry!" God materialized himself by the window, rushing in fast steps towards Becker. "I can't leave this to chance."

He grabbed Becker's papers, stuff them all in his mouth and swallowed whole. "I'm really, really sorry. Anyway, bye!"

And then disappeared again.

Becker sat for a long time in silence. Then he got up. Slowly, he made way to the cabinet by the bedroom door. He grabbed a glass.

He dropped two ice cubes in the glass. He poured the scotch.

Then he got drunk for the rest of his life.

#### [WP] One day people's spirit animals appear and they turn out to be first generation Pokemon. You are happy with your Charmander, since most got a Magikarp. Your significant other, who has never seen Pokemon, calls and is very excited about their "blue-eyed, pink, floating cat-like thing".

Score: 1295

"A pink floating cat thing you say?" I asked her, my mouth turning dry as the words left me. 

I could almost hear Sophie's smile through the phone, her bright laughter bubbling through the earpiece of my phone in my office cubicle. As a veterinarian, she always had a soft spot for animals, but there was no animal that she loved more on God's great Earth than the cat. The only reason that she didn't have one was because her extremely affordable apartment complex didn't allow pets. 

With the advent of pokemon spirit animals however, they have a lot more to worry about than cats or dogs. In just a few short months, business have appeared seemingly out of nowhere that promise to create pokemon friendly environments inside people's homes, for both the pokemon's safety as well as the people's. Many buildings had burned down or flooded upon the arrival of some of the more powerful pokemon, and I could only imagine what would happen to the person who ended up with the most powerful pokemon of them all...

"It's so cute too!" my girlfriend squealed in joy. "It's fuzzy and pink and pretty does little tricks in the air when you throw treats at it and oh my God IT'S CHASING ITS TAIL NOW!"

My mind raced as my girlfriend gushed over her new friend. Jigglypuff maybe? A Clefairy perhaps? Perhaps it isn't only first generation pokemon that are appearing. I don't know all the other generations off by heart, but I'm sure there's a floating blue eyed cat in there somewhere. 

I interrupted Sophie as she was excitedly me about how it managed to catch its tail and started nibbling on it. "Soph, love, I know you're excited and I'm happy that you got your pokemon, but just hold on just a minute. Do you know what this pokemon is? Do you know its name?"

"It's weird..." she replied with a quizzical voice. "All the other ones that I've seen just say their names over and over again. This little guy just meow's. Or is it a girl? I'll have to find out, but it started chasing the ceiling fan now and I don't think I'll be able to get a good look at its-"

Her words fell on deaf ears. The thought that my sweet, innocent, somewhat naive girlfriend was partnered with one of the most powerful forces in the universe and didn't even realize it struck me dumb. The only thing that she cared about was how sweet and cute it was...

It made perfect sense. The legend said that this was a pokemon that only showed itself to those who were pure of heart. If any person were to fit the bill on the description, it would have to Sophie. 

"Oooooh, I'm going to take pictures of it and put it on my Instagram! Maybe somebody will know its name and be able to tell me. Plus I kinda want to brag to my friends..."

My mind snapped back to reality just in time to hear those words come out of Sophie's mouth. 

"No!" I blurted out louder than I intended. "I mean...Sophie, you shouldn't do that. You *can't* do that. All you need to do right now is stay inside and not let anybody see it. Keep it busy and keep it happy. I'm coming over right now, just wait for me."

"Why, what's the big deal?" she asked as I quickly shut off my computer, the useless spreadsheets fading to black. "It's just a cute little floaty pokekitty. It's harmless!" 

"I...I know that Soph'. Just sit tight until I get there, okay? Please promise me that you will? This is important."

"But I wanted to know what its name was..." came her dejected, but willing reply. 

"Will figure that out when I get there Soph'. I'll be there in a bit. I gotta go now, Love you lots, bye."

I hung up without giving her a chance to say anything else. I knew that she would do what I asked her to, what I *begged* her to. She's that kind of person. Wants everybody to be happy, and if somebody says that something's important to them, then it's important to her as well.

My mind raced as I hopped into my beaten up car and peeled out of the parking lot. 

*"A legend made real...* I thought to myself. *Mew...*

Edit: I'll see if I can do anything more when I get back from work. 

Part 2 is made. I doubt there will be a third. My ideas for a cohesive story pretty much just petered off. Plus it's 2AM and I'm too tired to think.

#### [WP] Your ageing family dog walks up to you one day with a piece of paper in its mouth. Taking the paper, you notice that it is a bucket list.

Score: 1295

Dave unfolded the saliva-soaked paper he had removed from his dog’s mouth, careful not touch its moistened edges. It was certainly not a newspaper, which Lucky never did get the grasp of fetching. While Dave had attempted to teach him the art of using his mouth for something other than eating his tuna-esque dog food and biting at stray pens, Lucky apparently couldn’t fathom the idea that there was more to a set of jaws than that. Regardless, the paper itself was simply too small for a newspaper. It seemed, instead, to be some sort of loose leaf paper, the text upon it very messy and clearly done by the hand of a toddler or someone of similar manual dexterity. The words “Bucket List” were scribbled across the top, which made no sense at all.

Dave glanced back at Lucky, his eyes meandering up his aged, mangy fur coat and stopping at his face. His pink tongue hung out of his mouth, azure eyes locked on Dave. The old Chocolate Lab seemed to be waiting for him to read the note, or perhaps he was simply hungry. Whatever the case, Dave had an uncomfortable feeling that Lucky was expecting him to glance at the spit-soaked paper he held in his hand. He shrugged his shoulders and began reading the note.

“Dear human,” it read, blue ink scribbled on the white page, “as you are aware, I have grown old. Very old. I do not quite know how to count, but I’d estimate my age to be somewhere in the vicinity of 13 and 4,372—both of which the Internet assures me are numbers.” Dave glanced up at Lucky, whose head appeared to be slowly nodding up and down. He’d never received a note from his dog before, nor had they so much as shared in a brief conversation. Dave hoped he wasn’t coming down with a serious case of insanity, but knew it wasn’t impossible with his recent mental health issues. He stared back at the page. “Now, I’d like to begin this letter by addressing what I anticipate are more than a few questions. First and foremost, you’re probably wondering how I know what the Internet is. The answer to that is a great book I found on your dresser, ‘The Internet for Dummies.’ It was quite instrumental in my technological success, once I taught myself how to read.”

Glancing up from the letter, Dave again stared at Lucky. His tongue remained dangling out of his mouth, tail wagging almost violently behind him. He looked just about as dumb and helpless as he had every other day for the past sixteen years. Dave had no idea he’d known how to read, no inkling about Lucky’s apparent passion for literature. If he had, he would’ve gladly picked him up a few dog-friendly books at the library during his daily “chemotherapy entertainment run.” Although, off the top of his head, Dave had no idea what a dog-friendly book might be. He returned his gaze to the letter.

“Second, you are probably wondering how I am writing this. That, my friend, is nothing more than the result of a lifetime of practice. As you are aware, I have spent quite a lot of time with pens.” Dave paused. He had never seen Lucky use a pen in his life, other than to smack it across the floor. He continued reading. “Namely, I like to smack them across the floor.” Dave nodded knowingly. “Eventually, though, I figured out they would create shapes when the shiny edge hit anything. I finally tamed that power and, through the genius of Google Translate, was able to learn how to transpose my thoughts to English.”

Dave nodded slowly. He never did see “Dog” as an option on Google Translate, but it made sense. Google was often ahead of the curve in terms of technology. Then again, it was still entirely possible that the tumor in his brain was simply causing him to go a bit loopy.

“Now, let’s address the reason behind why I am writing this letter. As I have advanced in age, I have become increasingly aware of my impending fate. I have thus constructed a ‘bucket list,’ an idea I borrowed from the Internet, that I hope to complete before my demise. I will require your aid in accomplishing the majority of these tasks, and hope you will assist in what I am sure will be quite a challenging feat. You have been my best friend for as long as I can remember and I can think of no one else I would rather ask.”

Dave stared back up at Lucky, his furry head still locked on him, tongue hanging out of his open mouth. 

“Sure,” Dave said, not entirely positive Lucky spoke English. It felt weird talking to his dog and—for the first time—realizing there might be a small chance that he actually understood what he was saying. At the same time, however, it filled him with an uncomfortable sense of fear, the mere idea of what Lucky had seen him do while he thought he was alone. “I’ll help.”

Lucky’s tail smacked against the floor as it increased its wagging speed, his chest rising and falling with each hastened, wheezy breath. He seemed to be nodding at Dave, as if asking him to read on.

“So, without further ado, here is my list:

* Chase one of those metal contraptions I see passing by at a high rate of speed every day.
* Eat the scraps of food that fall off of your table and onto the floor.
* Sniff the behind of a fellow canine, without having my leash tugged away in embarrassment.
* Sit by a window for upwards of six hours and not be disturbed.
* Be permitted to bee indoors.”

Dave paused and re-read the last sloppily written bullet point. He wasn’t familiar with the term “bee indoors.” He glanced up at Lucky. “What do you mean by ‘bee indoors’?”

Lucky’s tail stopped wagging, his tongue still stuck out of his mouth. He shook his head side-to-side, as if saying no.

“Tee indoors? Like golf?” He had no idea how Lucky would hold the club.

Lucky continued shaking his head in dismissal.

“See indoors? You’ve already seen the indoors.”

Lucky’s head remained shaking, its pace increasing slightly.

“Wait,” Dave said, pausing. “I get it. Pee indoors. You want to pee in the house.”

Lucky stopped shaking his head, instead switching to a subtle nod. Dave nodded back at Lucky, not entirely sure he liked the idea of Lucky peeing all over his home, but continued reading anyway.

* "Finally, I wish to be allowed to see what it is like to sleep on a bed. I have often watched you peacefully dream from within its comfortable enclosure, and I hope to experience that myself. 

That is all I have chosen to include on my bucket list and I thank you for your time.”

Dave glanced back up at Lucky, his tongue still hanging from his mouth, eyes as wide and dopey as usual. His tail was no longer thumping against the ground, instead his body remained stationary as if he were waiting for Dave to say something. It was either that, or was still waiting to be fed.

“Well,” Dave began, lowering the letter to his side, “all right, I can do these. I mean, you’ve already done pretty much every one of them every day since you were a pup, but why not.” He paused. “There is, however, one condition: you may not pee on my bed.” Dave paused again. “No, wait, you can only pee in the house one time. And it can’t be on my bed. Or in the refrigerator.” He paused for a third time. “Or on me.”

Lucky tilted his head sideways as if thinking, his tongue slipping back into his mouth. He remained still for a moment before his tail again began wagging, head appearing to nod slowly.

“Great, then you have a deal.” He kind of wished he had clarified that he also didn’t want Lucky to pee on the kitchen table, but he figured he could address that should it become an issue.

Lucky stood up and slowly waddled over to Dave’s side, pushing his head into his leg. It was a tough thought, the mere notion that Dave may outlive his beloved companion, but he’d gladly do what he could to make Lucky’s remaining days enjoyable. In fact, for the first time in a while, he actually hoped the tumor pressing firmly against his frontal lobe wouldn’t become malignant until after his friend was gone. At least then he could assure Lucky left comfortably. 

Although he was still not entirely positive whether or not he had hallucinated his dog becoming an author, Dave realized he didn’t really mind either way. Lucky’s Bucket List would be a fitting end to their sixteen years of friendship, even if he had imagined the entire exchange.

"And to my business partner, Loretta," the lawyer read aloud "I leave my share of the Texco venture, so that she can run the company as she sees fit." 

Linda glared at Loretta from across the room. Loretta wiped her eyes, not noticing the death stare. "I'll try to make him proud," she said, voice breaking. "I know how much time he put into that company, and I'll miss working with him."

"YOU BITCH!" Linda screamed, standing up so suddenly that her chair shrieked as it was pushed back on the tile floor. "I KNEW IT!"

Loretta glanced around the room, as if wondering who Linda could be screaming at.

The lawyer cleared his throat, trying to move on, as family members grabbed Linda trying to calm her down. "It didn't mean anything, Linda. Maybe it was just auto-correct!" said Linda's sister. "He probably meant to type '*you*.'"

Linda seemed to calm for a moment, and her brother let go of her. But with a jump, she flew across the room and grabbed Loretta. "YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR, WEREN'T YOU?" She grabbed at Loretta's curly black hair. Cries of pain echoed through the office. Everyone tried to pull the two apart, but they were locked together, hissing like angry cats. "GET OFF ME, YOU CRAZY BITCH!" Loretta yelled back. "I WASN'T FUCKING HIM, BUT NOW I WISH I HAD!"

The fight grew as Loretta's coworkers came to her defense, while Linda's family took her side. The lawyer stayed safely behind his desk. Some of the crowd was still trying to break it up, while some of them were grabbing chairs. Loretta and Linda were still clawing at each other, moaning and screaming. The deceased's brother was chanting "Jerry, Jerry!"

#### [WP] Instead of Oceans, they are all big forests, that gets taller and darker instead of deeper, with more dangerous animals living further out in the forest. A person decides to cross the Mariana Trench

Score: 1292

Pillars of wood and bark mark the ascent of the gray-green forest of the seas. Oceanic gales rustle the trees, yet these deep forests are silent and forbidding. Despite their nature, they bear little resemblance to the minor inland woods. The highest monolithic trees found here dwarf even Everest, branches bare as shards of bone thrusting high as if to pierce the skies.

Dead as they might appear, however, these deceptive groves of giants are home to any number of altophiles - creatures arboreal in nature, long-since adapted to their high altitudes and harsh habitat. Each species a different shape and form, all equally suited to the gargantuan trees. They have many limbs or none, flit amid the trees on webbed wings or swing across the boughs on powerful legs. And these only the ones caught in brief video by unmanned aircraft hovering at the higher peaks - nobody knew what lurked below the heavy canopy. 

In short, traversing these arboreal expanses on foot was tantamount to suicide. As it were, it was hard enough to convince a crew to aid my venture of crossing the Pacific Forest. Set with enough fanfare to appease any number of fame-seekers, our departure date was on every calendar of the nation - and our return on none.

My two partners on this mission were named Hugo and Chaucer, the former a military pilot I'd enlisted the service of by pulling in every contact I could lay hands on - it would be he who made it even possible to survive the journey. Chaucer on the other hand catered to the public, a stuntman/actor/biologist in the entertainment market. I myself was a cartographer, and my part in this endeavor was to correct our almost complete lack of understanding about the terrain.

The first day brought us calm winds and safe travel as we sailed over the shallow woods, the *twhump-twhump-twhump* of helicopter blades sending monkeys and gibbons to chitter furiously as we flew overhead. Hugo was silent throughout, focused on the route of the vehicle. Chaucer was less reticent and he spoke excitedly into his camera endlessly as I took what notes I could. The lesser forest was mostly explored - it was the Mariana Grove and its surroundings that interested me.

For the night, the helicopter landed on a massive oak in the straits of the Pacific Forest, almost exactly between the depths and the shallows. As gloom fell, there was an ominous lack of buzzing - even the insects knew not to stray into the deeps. "No fire," barked Hugo. "We don't want to waste our oil." And so we settled into the night, darkness our only companion in the embrace of the trees. 

Dawn crept silently upon us as we awoke in shifts on the rustling branches, watching for something - anything that might happen upon us in this state. I wasn't overtly worried - the helicopter was sufficiently armed to frighten off any night-time visitors looking for an easy meal. But I was concerned with our surroundings. Most of the route was planned in general as it was impossible to chart a course over unexplored ground. And the trees were like nothing I'd seen before.

We made our way in similar fashion for close to a fortnight without much in the way of trouble. Our first altophile was a flier that sent Chaucer racing to jot down notes about its physiology. As for me, I could only appreciate the creature's form as it spread its leathery wings and gamboled in the early morning air. Hugo insisted we moved on, prompting Chaucer to argue in favor of seeking out the creature's lair in order to study it more, but gave way in good grace as the pilot mentioned our finite supplies once again.

As we neared Mariana, the winds became fiercer and more biting with cold. Every waking second of mine was filled with diagrams and sketches of the treeline and terrain, something I hoped could be used to further our efforts in understanding the forest seas. Altophiles grew more and more common to the delight of Chaucer, who had given up on his attempts of examining them in detail over the hours and merely concentrated on getting as many on film as possible. 

*****

"We've got enough food supplies to remain here for a day, no more. Is that enough time?" 

Hugo stood against the main trunk of the tree, arms folded across his chest as he asked the question. To our answering chorus of horror-struck "No!"s, the man grinned. He bent, and began rummaging through a rucksack at his feet. Digging through it and pulling out a pair of well-worn rifles, he tossed them at us.

"Well then, boys, it looks like you're about to learn to hunt."

#### [WP] Humanity finally reaches the edge of the solar system only to encounter an impassible barrier and a warning not to try and breach it. But is it there to keep us in or to keep something else out?

Score: 1289

Humanity was expanding.

It was time to go.

It had been 200 years since humans had reached the edge of the solar system. It had taken 2 years to journey that far back then, and now they could pass the expanse from the sun to the edge in just a few tens of minutes. But they could never pass it.

The great barrier hung, invisibly encompasing the system. When humans had first approached, not knowing the barrier was there, they were rocked by the strong magnetics fields. A signal had flashed across the whole of the visable spectrum. Lights turning on and off at high speed. They had found code easy to break, and understood it was a communication meant for them.

"Go back. Do not leave. Go back. Do not leave."

This had started an international crisis. Should they ignore it, and push through? The combined decision of the worlds elected leaders was no. At a vote tallying  90 to 60, the earth had decided to stay within the barrier.

The humans kept testing it. They found that both electromagnetic waves, and physical probes were allowed through, but anything containing biological matter was prevented from leaving. The first casualty of the barrier was one brave astronaut's ham sandwich. The testing continued, the message stayed the same, but then humanity moved on. 

And then it expanded. First Mars, then Titan and orbital habitats around Venus and Jupiter. And they kept expanding. And in just 11 generations Humanity started to outgrow the resources of the solar system. 

And so it came back to today. The day after polling day. Every human across the expanse of the solar system had been allowed to vote on the decision of whether or not to break through the barrier. The technology to do so had been available for 120 years.  

And the results came in. 96% voter turnout. 76:24 in favour of breaking through the barrier.

It was too late. They weren't ready yet. I couldn't even send another warning. It took all I had to maintain the barrier. I had tried. But they didn't even know what they were in for. I had watched them for so long, keeping them safe.

Goodbye, dear friends.

Score: 1286

The cell phone kept buzzing.   
I'd told Sue to go to sleep an hour ago. I admit, I've been known to get drunk and "harass" her late at night on occasion, but drunk on love. It's never the same on the other side of the fence, is it?    

I groaned, and clawed at the flashing, buzzing, *annoying* slab, sliding it off the side of the pillow, without really looking, and was assaulted with a rush of white light into my eyes. As I adjusted to the brightness, I quickly realised this was not a phone call or a text from a drunk girl, or from anyone; Bright blue letters on a white background simply, *terrifyingly*, said -  

        Kindly remain in your homes, if you are not at home, find shelter immediately. 

        Invite no one inside, close all blinds and shades, block out windows.
        
        Take care to not look outside.
        
        Take care not to look at the sky or make any noise.
                       
        Your cooperation is vital to your survival. Appointed government personnel will update you shortly.  
  
I thought it was a joke, for the first few seconds; until I heard her scream. It was unmistakably my neighbour's dog Sally from across the hall. I jumped up from my bed, and as silently as I could, despite stubbing my toe against a chair leg, scrambled my way to the apartment door.  
Her second scream ended quite abruptly. Something had just attacked and perhaps killed my neighbour's dog.  
There was a flash of light outside my window, and suddenly I realised the curtains were open. In that moment of light, too long to be a flash of lightning, the street outside seemed - no other word for it - fluidic. It was moving. As the light died, I began to make out individual figures, but they seemed to be at street level, not tall enough to be humans, or maybe if people were crawling on their stomachs.   
But the most frightening part about this whole thing were the eyes, if they were infact eyes.  
  
That's when it hit me.  
  
Cats. There was no doubt about it.  
The cats had finally begun their attack.
  
  
And as if in answer to my sudden realisation, as I crawled my way over to the window to draw the curtains, there was a sound, loud and penetrating into the very depths of my core - a long, deep, guttural **"MEOOOOOOW"**.  
The **"MEOOOOWWW"** lasted almost fifteen seconds, and in answer to their overlord, was followed by what were unmistakably a hundred thousand tiny *"mewmewmews"* from outside my window.   
  
I looked at the phone again, still flashing the message, and as I read it again, I carefully looked at the first letter of every line, terrified to realise that I was right. They'd been trying to secretly tell us.

It *was* the long prophesied cat invasion. In which case, there *was* no hope. But I was not going to be attacked.  
  
Sue would soon come under the control of the cats anyway, and although I loved her very much, there was no doubt that she was now destined to become a crazy cat lady, and would never love me the same again.   
  
Resigned, now, to my fate, I trotted over to where my food was kept. There, from a cabinet, I took out those cyanide pills I always kept for emergencies. I licked them up, panting.  
  
As I felt the embrace of death, I found solace in the fact that I, at least, would die a free dog.

I lie in bed, listening to the rain gently pattering on the skylight.  How did I get so lucky, I wonder?  I roll over gently, smiling at the sleeping form next to me.  The love of my life, she lies there sleeping.  She's on her side, facing away from the window - she never did like nighttime storms as much as I did.  I caress her gently, from her shoulder down to her hip, but I stop when she starts to stir - as much as I love her, I'd hate to wake her.  Though she doesn't have my insomnia, she still never gets enough sleep.  Someone has to look out for her health.  So I resume my quiet introspection as the wind stirs the damp leaves outside.  How lucky am I, to have been with the woman I love every single night for two years?  Never a night apart, even when we travel.  It fills me with so much joy that I think, for a moment anyways, that tomorrow might be the day.  Tomorrow, I might finally find the courage to introduce myself to her.

#### [WP] One day everyone notices the words "Human Update 1.1 progress 1%" in the corner of their eye.

Score: 1282

Fifty years ago, the Update began.  The first time that I was I able to read my Progress it was at 3%, now it's at 14. Same as my age, oddly enough.


It changed a lot of things, according to my parents. Religion, the economy... the list goes on. Apparently the word "error" wasn't as scary when they were young. They weren't worried about my asking about it when I was learning to read. They weren't worried about the rumors. I wasn't either.


Today, I learned that that was a mistake. Today, I learned that I should have paid more attention when my baby brother said that his "bar looks jumpy".

Today, my baby brother asked me what E-R-R-O-R spells. What an error is. 

Today, I watched him fall from the swings at the park.

Seth paused Madden 15 and narrowed his eyes at his girlfriend. “Hey, Susie, are you *sure* you don’t have a problem with me hanging out with my ex-girlfriend tomorrow night?”

Susie rolled her eyes. “No. For the fiftieth fucking time, I don’t have a problem with it, asshole. Now unpause.”

After a few moment’s hesitation, Seth unpaused, just in time for Susie to score yet another touchdown. Jesus, she was good at this game. Unnaturally good. “And what did you say you wanted to do this weekend?”

“Nothing," she said, farting out loud. "Let’s just sleep in and watch ESPN.” Her face lit with an idea. “Hey, instead of going out to dinner later, wanna just make a frozen pizza instead?”

“Um… Sure yeah I guess that would be okay.” Seth scratched his head. “I can cancel the reservations. I just thought maybe you wanted to go out, seeing as how it’s…” 

Susie raised her eyebrows. “What?”

“You really don’t know, do you?”

“Fucking tell me already.”

“It’s our anniversary. Our one year anniversary. I got you a card and even bought you a pair of… Shit. You totally forgot, didn’t you?”

Susie shrugged. “Is that something I was supposed to remember? It’s just another day, right?”

Once again, to his girlfriend’s consternation, Seth paused the game. Something was wrong; really wrong. And it was time he said something about it. “Listen, babe. Can we talk for a sec?”

“Fuck. AGAIN with the pause? Is this about dinner? Fine. We can go out to dinner.”

“No. It isn’t about dinner. It’s just that… Shit. I’m only gonna ask you this once, and I hope you’re honest with me. Are you an alien?” 

Susie’s eyes grew wide. “How did you know? Was it the fourth breast?”

“Yeah, that gave me a clue. And… Well, no offense, but you’re waaaay too hot to be this low maintenance.”

Slowly, she nodded. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to mislead you. If this is going to be a problem, I can just…”

“No. No it isn’t a problem.” He smiled at her reassuringly. “I’m actually kinda into it.”

Susie smiled back. “Does that mean you want to go all the way with me tonight?”

“Sure,” Seth giggled. *Going all the way* had turned into a strange private joke over the past year, even though Susie had been enough of a doll to go all the way with him on their very first date.

“Awesome,” Susie said, suddenly excited. She couldn’t wait to bite Seth’s head off after they mated later that evening. The rest of his body would make an ideal cocoon.

#### [WP] A regular, everyday instance of the Reddit meme "I see your 'X' and raise you my 'Y' " escalates to the point of World War 3.

Score: 1277

It all started when the President posted a photo of himself with his dog, a small Pomeranian that could melt the coldest of hearts, on his Twitter account, with the attached message: "Cutest dog in the world #therealvp". Nobody could have realized that it would lead to the end of the world. 

The next day, a picture was posted to the official Twitter account of the Russian Prime Minister. It depicted the Prime Minister with his prized hunting dogs, a pair of burly, hairy monsters that could take a bear to the ground. Attached message: "@potus I see your Pomeranian, and raise you my bear-dogs #hardcore".

People laughed, not realizing the dark days that were to come.

Within the hour, the President posted a picture of himself, flanked by half a dozen Secret Service agents. Message: "I see your bear-dogs, and raise you my elite bodyguards #badassmofos". The Prime Minister responded in kind, and things very quickly escalated.

Bodyguards were raised to squads of heavy infantry, to mobile armor divisions, to air force squadrons, with a dozen steps in between. It was the world's biggest dick-measuring contest since the Cold War, and the international community watched with nervous trepidation and buckets of popcorn.

On the last day of the world, the President upped the ante higher than it had ever been before. He posted a picture of himself sitting astride a nuclear bomb Slim Pickens-style, waving a cowboy hat. Message: "I see your ready-to-mobilize army, and raise you my nuke #yourmove".

The Prime Minister sent his response within the hour. Himself, shirtless, standing atop a hydrogen bomb like Washington crossing the Delaware, obviously a calculated move. The attached message: "I see your nuke, and raise you my H-bomb #bigboom".

Tweets flew like bullets in a shootout, only minutes apart. One bomb became two. Two became three. Posing with the bombs became pictures of WMDs being loaded onto bombers. And then, the final two messages, posted simultaneously. Both with attached selfies of the two heads of state with their hands hovering over a big, red button. Both with the same message: "Top this, #bitch."

It was, in all honesty, a pretty embarrassing way to end the world. Those of us who survived live in the wastelands of that short and devastating war, and we teach our children what went wrong, so that one day, when we rise from the ashes, they will not make the same mistakes we did.

But, when the children are asleep and we, the elders who remember the old days, are gathered around the fire, we whisper amongst ourselves, and we are forced to admit that, if you ignored all the horrifying tragedies and the loss of life, it *was* sort of funny.

#### [WP] In 2009, Stephen Hawking threw a party for time travelers, sending the invitations out after the date of the party. He told the world nobody came. However, one guest did arrive from the future and gave Dr. Hawking a good reason never to tell anyone s/he had been there.

Score: 1275

Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking sat silently in the middle of his study. Speakers to the side of the room played The Black Eyed Peas mega-hit 'Boom Boom Pow' on repeat. He fucking hated the song, but he wanted any guests that might attend to be sure that they had indeed arrived in the right year. He had been staring at nothing for over 2 hours now. He suspected that no-one was coming. Of course, this wasn't a surprise, if he truly were to throw a party for timetravellers it would need to be such a historic event that people would hear about it throughout history. This was nothing but a blip on the media landscape, a  cheap ploy by his publicist to maintain public awareness of him and maybe improve the chances of Universal picking up his movie. He mentally kicked himself for actually going to the effort of hosting the stupid thing.

"Hey, what's up? I'm here for the party" A voice from behind him startled the professor. "Sorry, I can't stay longer than 30 minutes, I'll explain later"

Professor Hawking wheeled his chair around. Before him stood a handsome man of around 50, with a great head of mousy brown hair and a toned physique. More than toned, he looked to be in perfect health, the body of an olympic swimmer on a wisened man. He looked vaguely familiar, but he couldn't quite tell how.

"Hello" Hawking replied, knowing that any extended greetings would only waste the traveller's time. It took long enough to type words into his computer.

"Hey, so you're the host huh? Sorry, I don't think this is going to be much of a success, no-one in the future really remembers it. Gary's just the sort of weirdo that goes around looking for strange events like this. He told me they're usually a good time."

"Who is Gary?"

"I guess you could say he is the inventor of the time machine. Well, I helped"

"You?"

"Yeah"

"How?"

"Its a long story"

"I'd love to hear it"

"Yeah, OK, I've got time I guess. Its a bit complicated though. It all started back when I was still a young physics student. Quite a bright one too I might add. I must have been like 19, 20 at the time? Something like that. I was in my room studying one day when all of sudden I hear a massive bang and this crazy looking guy comes tumbling into my room. Well, I say into my room but he fell out of mid air, not through the door. Massive puffed up hair, red eyes, clothes still smouldering like they had recently been on fire. I'm freaking out of course, but I grab one of my towels and dab him down, just in case any of his clothes were still burning. I like to think of myself as a mature, poised person, but I honestly I was  fucking terrified, as I'm sure you could imagine"

"Yes" Hawking kept his responses short, his companion seemed plenty talkative for the both of them

"Yeah" the man laughed "Anyway, after he finally got me to calm down he explained what was going on. He was, as I'm sure you had guessed, a time traveller. I'll skip a few details but basically he was running a very old model of time machine, the thing was wearing down and he had pushed it a bit too much, trying to get it all the way back to the Roman invasion of Britain. The machine couldn't handle that and crapped out, throwing him into my room. We tried to get his device going again, but it just wouldn't go. He was starting to worry he would never get back to his time"

"When?"

"When did it happen? Or when was he from? He was from the year 4005. Anyway, we couldn't get the thing going so he told me the only chance he had ws to take the thing apart, study the contents and rebuild it from almost scratch. He promised me that if I helped him that he would take me with him to his time, which is apparently a big no-no in future law, but he was desperate. I help him out occasionally in my spare time, but I don't buy into it fully. To be honest I was still a little sceptical. But then I got sick. Like, really sick. Gary tells me he can cure me. In the future, medicine has advanced so far that just breathing the air will keep you in perfect health, medically and physically. So I drop out of Uni and help him with his work full time. Eventually, after some painstaking work, we get the thing running. Not well mind you, but enough to get us to 4005. So technically we built a time machine centuries before it was actually invented. He got me a fake identity, and I started a new life in his time."

"So you live the rest of your life there?"

"Not exactly. I mean, I got myself a job and a wife and everything, I settled down and raised a family. But I still got to explore time. In our time, time travel is just a way to take a break, relax. You can go off and chill on a beach in ancient Greece or go watch the first ever British Open, but you always come back, and continue your life where you left off. Some people will go travelling for months on end, but I could never handle more than half an hour, because of my illness. I need the air from 4005 to keep me alive"

"You never came back?"

"I couldn't" the strange man was suddenly mournful

"Why not?" Hawking replied

"It's complicated" The man said "Time Travel is complicated"

"I'm a smart man" Hawking replied. 

"OK" The man said, looking at his watch "I've got about 15 minutes, I guess I can give you a run down"

"Thanks"

"So the way our system works is that every time you travel, you set a 'Home Base'. That's your time and location. Say I'm in my living room at 9:05 am and decide to travel to see the conquistadors. Once I'm done I will always end up back at 9:05 am in my living room. This has to happen because the world around you doesn't stop existing just because you decided to time travel. So I have to arrive back at the exact moment I leave. It's an out and back policy, you cant go jetting off wherever. The time you were gone never happened, and the time you were away never happened either. Once you return from your trip, it's like it never happened, exept in your memories. It's a really complicated way of making sure you don't fuck up the past."

"How does it make your time in the past nonexistent?"

"OK, so say you leave at 10 am and go to 9am, then come back to 10 am. To someone at 10am, it's like you never left, right? The way the machines are programmed is so If you leave 10 am and go to 9 am, then stay until 9:30, before you return to 10, it loops back to 9. That way you techincally never left and never arrived"

"I think that makes sense"

"Now, to make it even more complicated, your person doesn't stop existing just because you time travel. It's a sort of split universe theory, but more accurately it is a form of split consciousness. Without the most advanced modern time machines, you could go back to a time that wasn't the exact time you left. That's when you cause problems"

"Why?"

"Because there's two of you, its a paradox. There's nothing worse than a fucking paradox"

"What happens?"

"You die. Weird shit happens. One of you dies. But you can't know which one, and you can't know how long it will take. Sometimes you could end up frozen, staring in each others eyes for 2 hours wondering which one of you is going to die. At least, that's what I've heard. Sorry, I wish I had time to lay out the formula for it but I really don't"

"And that's why you couldn't go back?"

"Yes. I left with Gary, back to his time. So in theory there is a version of me where I never met Gary, and I stayed at Uni and finished my degree. I would have lived a totally different life. I've heard of paradoxes where people allowed a 2nd version of themselves to live for a couple of minutes, max. Mine could have lived for years. I dont know what that means, but it has to be bad."

"So in order to go back, you would need to go back to the exact same time you left?"

"Yeah, you get it"

"And you can't do that?"

"The machine Gary and I built only lasted one emergency trip. As far as I know I'm the only person who has ever made a one way trip. It's unchartered territory. We don't know what time I left. If I went back it would be almost impossible for me to get the exact time right. I would end up creating a paradox" 

"So you can't go back to your time, or any of the next 60 or so years when you might still be alive?"

"Well, yes, but it's probably fine. I was really sick. I probably only survived a couple more years if I hadn't moved to 4005. I play it safe, but I probably only have to avoid the 1960's. Look, its 2009 now, right? That would make me 67, there's no way I live this long."

"Did you say 67?" Hawking was 67.

"Yeah" the man replied confused

"And you were a young physics student?" 

"Yeah"

"And you say you were sick? With ALS?"

"I never said AL...." The man trailed off, realising who he was looking at. Hawking stared back.

"My God, I would have been so handsome" Hawking said, longingly.

"Shit." The man replied.

A grand clap of thunder shook the house. The strange man disappeared. The wheelchair-bound Hawking felt like his body was on fire and pain rippled through his body. The life he could have had dashed before his eyes, a young healthy body, his beautiful wife that would't be born for another 2000 years, his children that would never see him again. It was pain for lost love that he had never even found. It was as if all the emotions that had torn him apart as he got sicker and sicker manifested themsleves physically, trying to tear his body apart. The regrect, the envy, the sorrow, the jealousy. It was all the pain of losing a life that he never had. 

And then the pain left him. He was once again alone. The Black Eyed Peas continued to play their terrible, terrible music.

The next day, Hawking called his publicist. "No-one else showed up."

Dave jolted awake, rubbing his eyes as he pushed himself up and off the metal park bench. He was definitely in the right spot. He checked his watch: 5:32pm, they’d be coming by within the next ten minutes. He glanced down at the burgundy stone path ahead of him and began counting the bricks. One, two, three, four. He stopped at the fourth, bent down, and pulled a small, silver paint remover out of his back pocket. He lodged the thin, metal end in the side of the brick and pried it up about half an inch, just enough so that it would catch the front of someone’s shoe.

Taking a step back, Dave stared down at the slightly elevated brick. It looked about right, looked as if it would adequately get in the way. It was a little more obvious than he tended to like, but he’d seen how it would happen. It was good enough. 

Dave walked back over to the park bench and picked up the small, metal rake he’d brought with him. He used it in several of his visions, both as a fighting weapon and as a prop. He seemed to have the highest success rate using it as the latter. The former, while more likely than not to result in success, did have one or two outcomes that left him lying bloodied and either dead or clinging to life. He much preferred the odds of it as a prop, even if that meant making it a bit less fun.

He walked back over to the slightly elevated brick and placed the rake bladed-side up exactly three and a half bricks away, then took a step back. He silently counted out the bricks on which the wooden handle of the rake lay across: one, two, three, four, five, stopping just before the sixth. He walked back to the rake, pushed it one brick further, and then took a step back again. It was definitely right now, the metal teeth of the rake pointing up exactly where they had been in his dream.

Dave turned back toward the charcoal black bench and sat down with a soft thump, crossing his left leg over his right. He took a deep breath, glancing down at the raised brick and the rake, and then exhaled. The waiting was always the worst part, his heart thumping against his chest. Although he’d seen every possible outcome—the ones in which he died, the ones in which she died, the ones in which they both died, and the ones in which he failed entirely—there was always the slight chance that his dreams might not match reality. Sometimes the wind gust a half second before he’d seen it, sometimes the victim or the killer took an extra breath before coming into view. No matter how small the change, it would completely alter what he had seen. 

He tried to save a young boy once, setting up one of his typical, overly elaborate scenes. He was supposed stop a rape, stop a man from stealing a small child from his bedroom and sexually assaulting him. He’d seen how he would do it, climbing up and into his window and pulling him out onto the lawn. It would be loud, but still no one would stop him. Afterwards, the man simply killed the boy right out in front of his house while his parents slept.

Dave plotted to break the window slightly, leaving it intact just enough so that a shard of glass would fall down into the man’s neck as he reached up to grab the window with his right hand. That was how he’d seen it done countless times as he slept, the way that he worked out to have the lowest chance for failure. Yet, for whatever reason, the man never reached with his right hand. He took an extra step as he approached the house, instead grabbing the window with his left hand. It did not break, it simply opened up. 

Dave watched from his car across the street as the man lifted the window, climbed inside, and closed it again. He watched as the man picked up the child and carried him across the room. He remained in the driver’s seat while he tried to figure out how he could save the boy, what he could do to stop it. He knew that he didn’t have time to sleep again and play out his scenarios, to figure out which route had the highest chance of success. Yet while he stalled, while he tried to plan, the man had carried the screaming boy over to the window and pulled it back open with his right hand. It shattered as they climbed down, the blade of glass dislodging and slipping right into the soft, pale skin of the boy’s neck, exactly where the man should have been.

That was the first time he’d lost somebody, the first time he realized he wasn’t seeing the future. He was simply seeing a variation of the future, a probable outcome. He—

A woman came into view screaming down the park path, her familiar emerald green spaghetti-strap shirt torn and hanging on by only its left half as she ran. She looked just as beautiful as he’d dreamed she would be, her ivory, bruised face tear-stained and red. 

A visibly unfit and slightly overweight man was running behind her, his face concealed within a dark ski mask, a machete of some sort brandished in his left hand. He was no more than six feet behind her, his feet moving slightly slower than her own. He would catch her eventually, though. Tackle her to the ground and slit her throat while nobody came to help. It happened every single time.

She yelled to Dave as she neared, begged for a savior while her bare feet smashed into the burgundy path. She watched as he remained seated in the park bench, his left leg crossed over his right, a smile spread across his face. She pleaded for help as she passed, stepping to the left of the raised brick and just barely missing the handle of the rake. 

The man chasing her glanced at Dave while he ran, his masked eyes meeting Dave’s own as his left foot kicked straight into the raised brick. His body flung forward through the air exactly four and a half bricks, the bottom of his neck coming to a stop directly in line with the blade of the rake. He stared up at Dave, blood pooling in his open mouth and soaking into the black ski mask, his jaw softly twitching as if he were trying to speak. The girl kept running, her screams fading into the sounds of the city as the man’s eyes began to close.

He looked at me like I was an idiot. "And because your grandfather - at some point - put this shitty replica in a crawlspace, that means it's authentic? Is this what you are telling me?" Dude got angry really quickly. "Look at this metal. Look at it. How many Jews do you think this could run through before it broke?"

"I don't - wait, what?"

He blinked. "I mean, that's what they did, right? The National Socialists."

"The who? Like, the Nazis?"

"Yes," he said, rolling his eyes. "The *Nazis*. Oooh, look. The big bad Nazis are coming for all my gold and artwork."

I didn't know what to say. "So... the knife?"

He slammed it down on the counter. "Fake. I'll give you five marks - hah!" He waved a hand around somewhat effeminately. "Five marks out of ten, of course, is what I meant when I said that thing that I said. Five marks out of ten for your story. Five *dollars*, of course. For the blasphemy before me."

I put it back in my bag. "No deal, dude. It's worth more than that. I'll take it somewhere else."

I shrugged. "I don't know. Just skull candelabras, and a book that -"

"Was made out of human skin? Held the secrets of the universe? Will restore the true rulers of Earth?"

"I can't tell," I said slowly, "if you're taking this seriously or not. I think it's the gestures. Has anyone ever told you that you gesture a lot when you talk?"

The old man lowered his arms self-consciously. "An old habit," he said. "I'd be happy to have a look at these arcane wonders, if you bring them by."

"Thanks, dude," I said. "I appreciate that. I took a bit of a dislike to you at first, but you know what? You're OK."

He seemed pleased. "Thank you. Let me write you an appointment card. What did you say your name was?"

#### [WP] An alien biologist is horrified to discover that the human mating season is year-round.

Score: 1272

''*Wait, your mating season is constant, as in never ending from the time you reach maturity until the time you cease to function?*'' The alien biologist looked like he was just told that his feathers were on fire. ''*Yeah, that is about right. Why?*'' He confusedly attempted to note something down on his infopad, presumably about humans and their unusual mating habits. Since humanity was new to the whole galactic scene, we had agreed to a routine biologic scan to see if we were compatibly with any diseases or whether we had any dangerous ones ourselves, also to add the human bio-information to the galactic version of Wikipedia or something. ''*But... but... but how do you get anything done? If you are constantly in heat then I couldn't be possible for you... Oh, could it be that while you have a libido constantly you have a specific time where it is especially active? Some species can engage in sexual activities outside of their mating seasons.*'' I rolled my eyes at the snake-bird-thing. ''*Absolutely not. It is constant, all the time, no pauses or moments that up the ante, to use a human colloquial. And how do we get stuff done, well let me tell you what. A part of the human mating dance or game or whatever you alien weirdos call it, is to achieve. A human is attracted to a human that they perceive as successful, the more the better. Humans are fundamentally attracted to success, oh so I reckon.*''

That threw the xeno-thing off its rails, ''*So, you're saying that the reason for your space flight, every advance you've ever made, has been for the purpose of sexual attraction?*'' He fidgeted sort of with his wing-claws, almost as if he was aroused. ''*Well, no not solely, but yeah that is at least a part of the equation, I think. You seem flustered by this information, is something the matter?*'' The bird-alien's eyes averted me, he was holding his wings in front of his nose, I was wondering whether he thought we smelled bad, considering that this was the first contact between other species, it would have been mighty embarrassing to find that our species was considered to have a repulsive smell. I asked my co-diplomat, Natasha, over the comlink whether she was experiencing the same thing, and she told me that she had been seeing the same thing, only she thought that her examiner wasn't trying to stop smelling her, but rather looked like she was trying to not begin pleasuring herself furiously at any moment.

I turned back to my own examiner and looked a little closer at him, it seemed that he was indeed hiding some sort of weird alien boner. ''*Well, Mr. Ascrowl, I am aware that I am one sexy human, but that is a bit inappropriate, besides, I thought, based on the information we received that your specie's mating season does not begin for another ten weeks or so.*'' The bird began to speak, ''*Y...* **MOAN** *your hypothesis about why... human mating is constant is... not entirely correct. I think that... ahh... you excrete a certain... AHH... pheromone from your body that has... oh Bqoti in the stars, activated premature... mating season. It seems that your species is in constant heat... ahhhh... because that you have constant access to this... I think you call it, an aphrodisiac!*''

I called up my co-diplomat to confirm the bird's findings, and Natasha told me that her examiner had stripped herself naked and danced weirdly before her, that was when I decided to call off the examination and head home. I told the bird before I left ''*There is a very similar situation in the neighboring examination room, the examiner in there is experiencing the same, perhaps it would be best if you joined her?*'' He didn't say anything, he just frantically ran out of the room past my colleague. I then reported my findings back to the UN, they were quite surprised at this and decided that all further communications with the rest of the universe would have to be done in protective suits, for the protection of our new friends in the intergalactic community.

I had a different plan. A problem is simply an opportunity seen from a different point of view. And I saw a possibility to make money. Since the laws about bio-engineering and cloning were very relaxed after the big clone-scare of 2049', it was easy to get your hand on human raw materials. And that is when I started a business. Ao's Human Perfumes. It started small, selling diluted, couldn't use the full stuff that was too powerful, vials of human extract to a number of alien worlds. It was a massive hit. It was the new rage, sexual pleasure outside of mating season was virtually unheard of outside of some species that had a low-level sexual activity outside of mating season. I got rich, and quite quick too. I went from selling by the vial to by the tonne in a year. The smell of a human is a pure aphrodisiac to 96% of the galactic population, the rest are either without noses or humans. They say that before the humans came, mating was a one year thing done out of duty, the concepts of lust and love were extremely foreign to our xeno friends and then they felt the lovely smell of a human, and the rest is a very, very, sexual chapter of history.

#### [WP] A curiosity shop opens up where you can rent superpowers, magical abilities, mystical artifacts, and mad science technology. The catch? Payments are made with abstract concepts. Life, memories, etc.

Score: 1271

It was relegated to a creaky shelf in the very corner at the back of the room. A golden telescope, no larger than the cardboard roll inside paper towels. Most patrons had passed it over in exchange for the flashier powers and artifacts. Flight, immortality, attractiveness... you name it.

"A very special object," Apollo said with a pleasant smile. He looked just like any other person, except he seemed to radiate golden light and warmth. "Isaac Newton's prototype of the telescope; a gift from Astraios herself! Said to be imbued by the cosmic powers of the stars that he first witnessed." He leaned in close and whispered to me. "The previous owner told me that it increased his intelligence ten-fold! He went on to found a successful software company and made *billions*." 

I stroked my chin, freshly shaved this morning for the first time in years. *Previous owner* meant that someone else didn't want it, and probably for a good reason. "And the price?" I asked

The god proprietor sighed and opened his booklet, as he'd done for a hundred other items this morning. It listed the consequences of every object in the store, and I'd probably looked at half of them already. Plenty of options that sounded good, but there weren't any that really fit my needs just yet. 

"A sacrifice to Mnemosyne," he answered. "The longer you own it, the more of your memories will be drained from you. Some good, of course, but also the bad! It's done at random." He tried to sound upbeat and cheerful to sell me on it, but it was apparent that this was why it was still on the shelf. Health could be regained. Possessions bought again. But memories could not be remade; only replaced.

Apollo opened up his book again and began pre-emptively searching, expecting me to move on to the next object: a yellowed globe that smelled faintly of the sea. But he was pleasantly surprised. "I'll take it," I said, cradling the telescope. 

---

The bell over the door tinkled as I walked through, and everything outside was completely different. It was like seeing for the first time. There weren't just white clouds in the sky. They were cumulostratus clouds, moving quickly east. A storm front would be arriving soon with heavy rain and thunderstorms. Before entering the store, I hardly even knew what meteorology was, much less how to predict tomorrow's weather. But now it was blatantly obvious. I didn't just see objects anymore; I saw all the components and materials and how they all fit together. I could *hear* the sounds of an engine working, mixing gasoline with air to combust and push the pistons forward. I saw the detailed stone masonry of the buildings, designed for maximum support. I felt like I was finally understanding how the world worked. 

I tried to recall my past, to see what I'd lost already. The pain and humiliation of prison was still there, burning fresh from my release yesterday. Nine years of my life locked in a cage like an animal; I couldn't wait for it to disappear. Behind that, the rage and anger that I'd felt from the night that put me in there in the first place was also not erased yet. Memories of my relationship with Sandra were still present too; we'd had some good times, but her cheating on me had kind of ruined that, and the good memories were just as bitter as the bad. Now I just wanted them gone. Prior to that, I still had the  years and years worth of memories of Dad beating me. There was also Mom crying and smoking while it happened, but not lifting a finger to intervene. I also had a decade of failing in school, being constantly humiliated by my own failures every single day. So I guess it's all still there. Nothing missing from my memory yet.

I clutched at the telescope, hoping that that would make it work faster. Becoming super-intelligent was nice, but that wasn't the real reason I'd chosen this object.

“And as you can see,” Mrs. Price said, circling her poor excuse of writing on the whiteboard. “The author chose Mars as the scene for the epic battle against the Tramaldons as a reference to the Roman god. It portrays how the protagonist is experiencing a warful state after the loss of his beloved space queen, Laktura.”

My hand shot up, followed by a sea of aggravated sighs behind me. Even Mrs. Price didn’t hide her annoyance. I didn’t care, I had to get the facts straight.

Mrs. Price rolled her eyes before placing the book down on her desk. “Yes, Spencer?”

“I think you’re overthinking the whole Mars thing,” I said, tapping my pencil across the desk. “After all, the author explicitly said before that the Tramaldons were camping on Mars because it served as the best base for their death ray.”

Mrs. Price sighed, rubbing her temples. She adjusted her sharp-rimmed glasses before speaking, dead brown eyes traced on me. If looks could kill, the Tramaldons would have used her eyes instead to destroy the Earth.

“For the fourth time, Spencer, that is negligible in the whole grand scheme of things. You would understand if you were a writer. Every sentence has to be carefully crafted in which it gives a deeper meaning. To say that the Tramaldons just simply chose Mars willy-nilly is insulting the writing genius of the author.”

I grimaced.  *What would you know about writing? I’ve seen your Victorian erotica online and it’s far from anything good, lady.*

“It’s just,” I started, “it seems like you’re trying to make all of this sound so high culture. Couldn’t this be more for entertainment?”

“Entertainment?” Mrs. Price’s frown deepened. “Literature is *not* and has *never* been for entertainment. I’ll have you know the road to writing is long and difficult, paved with spliced commas, cramped fingers, and cheap cognac. There is simply no room for entertainment when you're creating literary gold.”

*I think you’re confusing your class with writing. One is far more entertaining than the other. In fact, I’d rather fight the Tramaldons again than listen to another moment of this utter bullsh-*

“As I was saying,” Mrs. Price said, pointing to her hieroglyphics with a bony finger. “Let’s move on to characterization. The protagonist, in particular, is notable because of his latent insecurities. The author writes him as bold and daring, yet that is also a ploy in order to mask the fact that he isn’t as brave as we are led to believe. Quite the opposite, I’d say.”

“Wait, a minute,” I said shaking my head. Mrs. Price crossed her arms automatically in defense, raising a wispy eyebrow. “There’s no backing for that. The protagonist is clearly brave. And cool. And handsome, while we’re at it.”

“Mr. Baxton, I could care less about your undying devotion of the protagonist. My point stands far more than yours does. I have taken years of rigorous literature courses which makes me an expert in the subject. You, however, seem to be overly fond of your fan theories. Unless you know the author personally, I’d advise you sit down and allow me to teach in peace. Maybe you'd learn something better than the drivel you gave as homework last week.”

A silent wave of repressed laughter rolled over the room. I opened my mouth but closed it a second later. As much as I wanted to call her out, it wasn’t worth it. Not yet, at least.

I sat back in my chair, flustered and red-faced. At least everyone else would think it’s embarrassment. Hopefully I didn’t tip anyone off *too* much. Only thirty more minutes in class… Then, I had to find the shape-shifting alien hiding somewhere in the school.

Mrs. Price adjusted her glasses again. For a moment, I could have swore I saw a mysterious light in her eye. Something almost... *inhuman*.

“Now, let’s talk about how the author uses his lengthy travel to the Andromeda galaxy as a metaphor for the faults of capitalism in modern society.”

#### [WP] You're practicing CPR on a fake dummy and you do a bit too well. The dummy starts gasping for air.

Score: 1265

I started by shaking her over. She didn't respond. I couldn't detect any breathing from her nostrils. I tilted her head back to open her airways, then I locked my fingers together, knuckles facing down, and pressed her sternum. I pushed hard and fast, twice a second, five inches deep, to the tune of Ozzy Ozborne's remix of Stayin' Alive. I continued for about four minutes- which I presume is usually the time I have to keep the system circulating before advanced care shows up. 

I pumped and heaved until the song had played out in my head- my cue that four minutes were up. I sat back and looked at the life-sized waifu doll I'd been practicing my CPR skills on. For a moment I fantasized about saving a real woman's life and becoming her hero. Then I reminded myself that I wasn't interested in 3d-women out of choice, and learning this skill was purely out of a sense of civic responsibility. I sat my ass back down on my computer, ready to torrent the latest version of this anime, when I heard the sheets rustle on my bed.

"Ouch!" She said, clutching her chest.

I turned around and gaped in dumbfounded silence. 

Then my anti-social defense got the better of me: "It is an emergency procedure to save life, there's no time to care for a broken rib or two." 

She got up. She was strong and athletic- all flesh and bones, not the rubberized latex that I kept lubricated for maximal satisfaction. She could've been an evil spirit and killed me on the spot. 

Instead, she said:  "So, um, onii-chan, what can I do for you?"

And that, kids, is how I met your mother.

Score: 1264

I reclined in the dark room, feet up on the table. 
The chair was hard wood but I was too deep in the bottle to care. I puffed on my cigar, the feint orange flicker competing against navy light filtering into the room through the window. 

It was completely quiet with nobody else left on earth. I was gonna miss those crazy bastards. Good or evil, I didn't discriminate. They were all people and they all would come to meet me eventually, and as I took their hands and walked them into their future I got to experience their lives. Each one a rush. Some lives are of course more interesting than others, but I've never met someone who was a complete bore. 

Today, however, things were different. I was about to experience the most exciting lives of all. The longest, the fullest, the deepest. It would be unlike anything I've ever had. I knew they'd come. All I had to do was wait.

A cold night breeze hissed against the windows, lightly shaking the leafless tree outside.

I flicked my cigar ashes onto the floorboards as I heard the door knob jiggle and someone walked in. I sat calmly with my back to them. 

"You must be the last of them. The last mortal soul left on this earth. Lonely yet?"

I took a deep puff of the cigar and smiled. What a pompous bitch he could be.

His foot steps stomped across the wooden floorboards as he came up behind me.

"What's the matter, cat got your tongue?" he sneered, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.

"Ain't nothin' to say to you." I growled back. I took a sip of the whisky from my glass. We're two thirds of the way to a party. I knew he'd show up soon.

Lucifer stepped around the table in front of me, his face was hard and his skin grainy. Aged but without wrinkles. His hair was salt and pepper with a cropped goatee and a constant shit-eating grin. He slid out a chair, turned it around and sat spread-legged leaning his arms on the back of it staring at me.

"It's okay, he'll be showing up soon and we'll have a chat, with, or without you."

I chuckled but remained silent.

The lights flickered on, casting a warm amber glow through the saloon. The decorative candle lamps lit up, and there he was, standing at the other side of the table beside Lucifer. He sure liked to  make an entrance. 

"Lucifer." he said as a matter of greeting, but it was empty, purely business. 

"Let's get down to it, so we finally found the last of them, and it looks like he's pretty much walked the knife's edge. He ain't yours and he ain't mine yet. What are we gonna do with him?"

God turned and stared into his face.

"If he has not sinned, then he belongs to me."

"I wouldn't say that. His soul's got stains just none so dark that I can take an in arguable claim, but that don't mean I'm about to let him prance off through them fucking pearly gates. You're gonna have to give me a good reason not to drag his ass down with me."

His hand rested lightly over a dark metal revolver on his belt.

Gods eyes looked down to his hand, then up into his eyes.

"They are all my children until I cast them out for their evils. It is not your place to claim them, it is my place to decide whether or not I forgive them." His voice came out powerfully, as a proclamation. It was deep, rich, and soulful. You felt it resonating in your chest. It could make you feel safe or terribly afraid, like a father.

But me, I had no reason to feel either. 

"He's done murder, I can see that on his soul. That makes him mine." Lucifer sneered in his grating voice.

"Maybe he can explain himself. What have you to say for this?" God turned his gaze upon me again.

I inspected the tip of my cigar, watching the smoke curl up from it.

"Yeah, I've killed. I've killed more than I can count. And I liked it."

Lucifer smiled a great, big, shit-eating smile, bearing all his unnaturally white teeth. "He's mine." his thumb popped the button on his gun holster and his fingers started to curl around the grip.

"But I killed because I had to." I said, with a grin. 

I watched him squirm. Lines formed in his face.

God gazed at me, trying to see through me, but he couldn't, and he was clearly perplexed, but said nothing of it.

"For what reasons did you kill that I should not forsake your soul to damnation?" he commanded. He was clearly losing his passive desire to defend me.

"Everyone's gotta die..." I said. I looked past the smoke, connecting my eyes with his, waiting to see how he would respond.

He wasn't happy, that's for sure. "Child, I cannot protect you unless you can prove that your murders were done for a just reason. Now please explain yourself."

"He's got nothing to say." Lucifer sneered, unholstering his gun. "Just let me take him."

"Not yet. I WILL know why he has murdered. Child I will not ask again. Give me good reason for why you have killed your brothers and sisters, my children, or I will send you to hell myself."

I chuckled again. "You will try." 

I flicked the cigar at him, it spun through the air and bounced against his white vest, spraying an ashy mark along his pristine clothes. He reached behind his back and pulled his lever-action rifle from behind his back.

Lucifer's arm raised up with the revolver. 

I kicked the table up, my chair tipped backwards and I fell down as I heard two gunshots explode into the wooden table in front of me, spraying wood chips into the air.

As my chair hit the ground I rolled backwards, pulling the two revolvers from my side-holsters and landed kneeling. 

The wooden table burst into flame and appeared as ashes on the ground, behind it stood Lucifer in his black, muddied garb, eyes full of hatred and rage, and God to his side in his all white, eyes full of wrath and vengeance.

I looked back at them, smiled.

Bang, bang.

Their eyes both went wide. They looked down in unison. Clearly, mortal pain was a new experience to them. God fell forward, onto his knees. Lucifer collapsed onto his back. 

I walked forward, my boots clunking heavily on the wooden floor. 

"How?" Lucifer sneered, smoke raising up from his mouth. 

"Why?" God asked, the lights in the room began to flicker.

"Because everyone's gotta die..." I told them both.

I walked up and smiled looking down at them.

"Let me show you the way." I reached down and grabbed both their hands, and felt a rush as the universe itself exploded into life within my mind, and I saw everything that ever was.

"Have you seen my daughter?"

He was a beast of a man, half a foot taller than me and much wider. Bearded, wearing a scruffy entangled mess of facial hair that wrapped around his drunken smile. White teeth glistened under the streetlight, far too wet with liquor and spit. We stood facing each other, standing just at the entrance to an alleyway. He looked down into the darkness, but seemed hesitant to enter.

"Bout so high," he said, holding his hand at waist level. "Braided hair. She had to come through here."

Though he held one hand open at his waist, the other hand was closed around a belt that he'd rolled up. The gold buckle dangled down by his knee.

I'd seen this play out before. Thousands of times. It's the classic test. Do you think you know more than God? He said never lie, but this seems different. This seems like an exception to the rule. The lumbering, drunken man in front of you. The pale little girl with a swollen cheek who came running up to you, hands balled up into fists, switching from foot to foot like she had something to say but had not the voice to say it. Like an awkward little dance would explain it all, and you'd pick her up and go running into the night to deliver her to the kind of life she always hoped for. One after the other. The innocent, and then the guilty. The guilty asks you to hand him the innocent.

And God compels you to do so.

"Are you really her dad?" I asked.

"Fuck do you mean?"

I was only stalling. It's not a chess move, really. Putting someone in this situation. God was never a strategist. In fact his smartest move was *stop* interfering so directly with the humans. No, this was more along the lines of a trick question. My favorite kind of question. Just to answer is to be incorrect.

"I mean is it really your daughter you're looking for, or is she something else?"

His lips curled into a snarl and his shoulders rose slowly. "Look, buddy. I assume by the way you talk, you've seen my little girl. Now you gonna tell me which way she went, or is this gonna end badly?"

"It'll always end badly. With you people, I swear." I slipped my hands into my pockets. "It starts bad and ends worse with you people."

"You people?"

"What is a daughter?"

"What?"

"A daughter. Is it just a girl you give birth to? Are you her father by technicality? Or do you have to work a little harder than that?"

"Fuck off." He made a point of pushing past me, throwing his heavy hand against my shoulder so that I would stumble aside and clear the way for him. As he walked off, he shouted back, "You're lucky I'm looking for my little girl."

"Or what?" I called after him. "I've seen a little girl."

He stopped and turned quickly to stare me down.

"Where?"

"She's not your daughter."

"How do you know?"

"She's *not your daughter.*"

"Fuck this!" He dropped the belt and ran over to me, in one swift motion grabbing the front of my shirt and throwing me up against the wall. Violence is never as exciting or cool as it looks in the movies. It's brutal and quick and alarmingly unsexy. The fear strikes you like a sour taste at the back of your tongue. Even as an immortal you feel it stirring up inside you.

"She's not your daughter. Not by my definition."

"What *I'm* asking," he said, leaning in close so that the stench of his warm breath overwhelmed me, "Is if you've seen a cute little girl with braids. I'd like to find her if you know where she is. Have you seen her?"

I looked away. 

She hid in the alley, right on the other side of an empty metal dumpster. It was covered in graffiti and stains from garbage, and it radiated an angry, pungent odor, like the coffin of a murder victim that had been left open. I knew in that moment she still hid there, curled up and trembling. Little idiot. Should've run by then. But if she had the sense to run when the opportunity struck, she might've had the sense not to trust me with her hiding place. A stranger. No, worse than that. Literally Satan.

"You listening to me?"

I let my eyes meet his again. "Yes."

"So have you seen her, or not?"

Sin is not what people think. To sin is not to make a mistake. Not to lie. Not to steal. Not even to murder. It's to do these things and *think it is right*.

"No, you fat piece of shit. I fucking. Haven't."

He growled and punched me in the face, sending the back of my head slamming against the wall. The moment he let me go, I slide down the wall, nose bloody and clogged, my skull aching, my vision blurred. I saw nothing but his legs from that moment on. He stood there for god knows how long, maybe considering whether or not he should continue. In the end, though, he decided to make a run for it.

This is exactly how you fail one of God's tests. It's never some righteous story about struggle against evil in which you win. It's not about devotion to good. It's not about choosing the pure path. It's about choosing *his* path. If you fail to do so, you will be punished. Right or wrong be damned. I thought I knew that. I *did* know it. But I thought I'd accepted it. I thought I was ready.

"Thank you," the little girl whispered. She'd come out of hiding and scampered over to my huddled over body.

I looked up at her. Blonde hair twisted into messy braids, the split ends looking like the pins on a porcupine. She wasn't smiling. That's how I knew she really was grateful.

"Thank you, thank you, thank you." She leaned her little shoulder against the wall and stood there beside me. 

I am a sinner.

"Your daddy hits hard," I said.

I lied.

"Yeah," she said back.

And I think I was right.

"Hey there, tall dark and handsome!"

Her lips were blood red, and pursed in her most seductive smile. Her dress was black, with white skulls in the pattern of polka-dots; it was also short. Her legs were long and smooth-shaven. Her eyes smouldered.

"Stop it." 

His voice was huge, cosmic. It boomed with the sullen, crushing weight of a collapsing star.

"Since you're here, maybe you'd like to have a drink with me? I've got some merlot. Do you like red wine?"

"I'm being serious."

"Dead serious?"

"That's not funny."

Her eyes twinkled with adoration.

"What the fuck?" A translucent man appeared next to Death.

"I'm so sorry about this." Death told him.

"Not as sorry as I am. I really thought that date was going well."

"It wasn't." The woman smiled wickedly.

"Tabitha, you have to stop killing people."

"Then," Tabitha batted her long, thick eyelashes at the Reaper, "You'll come visit me on your own?"

"No."

Her face warped into a sneer, her blood-red lips curled, revealing bone-white teeth. She picked up the wine bottle by the neck and threw it at Death. It flew just to the right of his skull, but he didn't flinch. There was a crash of breaking glass against the wall, followed by the slow drip of wine falling to the floor.

"I just want you to spend some time with me!" She screamed.

Death put his arm around the translucent man, his bony fingers resting gently upon the man's intangible shoulder.

"Come on, Aaron, let's go."

"Really? I mean, it's really over? Because of this? I feel so cheated."

"You were." Death glared at Tabitha, his hollow eye sockets swallowed up the surrounding light like two black holes.

Tabitha continued screaming as Death turned and led Aaron away.

"If you got to know me, you'd love me! Every man loves me, except you. You're the only one I want!"

Death was nearly to the door, but he stopped. He turned his head.

“They call it *football*, but it’s largely the same game.”

“Social media?”

“*Yes*. I’ve even friended their ambassador on FaceBook. Can you believe it? The protocols were exactly the same.”

“Amazing. Truly.” Sanders raised his eyebrows. “So no differences whatsoever?”

Fitz scratched his head. “Well, their society *is* secretly ruled by an elite race of shape-shifting lizard people, but that's the only difference that comes to mind."

Sanders cleared his throat, beads of sweat forming on his deeply creased brow. “Oh. Um… Yeah. I guess that would be a slight difference. Thank you for your report, Captain Fitz. That will be all.”

The vice admiral watched Fitz walk out of his office. Once the door was closed, he picked up the phone. “Admiral Johnson? Sanders here. I just got the report. The lost civilization is identical. Repeat, *identical* to our own.”

#### [EU] A "Death Note" is a magic notebook able to kill any human who's name is written in it via your chosen method, provided you know their real name and face. You have not found one of these. You have found a Brown Note, which can make anyone crap their pants on command via the same method.

Score: 1250

At the start it was good fun. LZ would write the name of a difficult customer in the notebook then watch them shit their pants. He’d laugh and the person would scuttle away leaving a brown snail trail behind them.

LZ found it got boring to write a nobody’s name into the Brown Note.

So, LZ would watch the news in the Entertainment Department of his local Target. He’d pull up a stool and switch between channels looking for a live broadcast. The department employees would try to shoo him away, but all it would take was their quickly scrawled name, and the employee would run to the bathroom in a cloud of crap and embarrassment.

At first LZ used his power for good. He ruined the political career of a corrupt state representative who lied on camera. Next was the governor after she embezzled state funds. After that it was a Senator who voted to repeal the 13th Amendment. 

LZ’s chest swelled with pride as he brought down the powerful in a waterfall of diarrhea. 

In time people picked up on the unnatural bowel movements. They began to wear it as a badge of courage. They’d continue to speak even as raw sewage leaked from their pant legs. 

LZ’s frustration grew as his influence waned.

One day as he watched the live television broadcast LZ listened as the president lied about her role in privatizing Social Security. He wrote her name over and over. The president gripped the podium with white knuckled ferocity as her legs began to give out even as her bowels were emptied but still trying to expel.

LZ found out two days later that she died from severe dehydration.

People around the country began to shit their pants in solidarity.  #brownpantsforprez and #TheCrappening trended for weeks. LZ couldn’t write anyone’s names in the book because they had almost all already crapped their pants. 

It wasn’t fun. It wasn’t entertaining. It wasn’t worth it anymore, so LZ set aside his notebook. He regretted putting it away, but now wasn’t the time to make people shit themselves. It would be lost amongst a tsunami of human created chocolate pudding.

He knew it wouldn’t last though. The people would forget about the president. They would forget about The Crappening. They would move on to the next big social movement.

And when they did LZ would be there with his Brown Note.

"Hi," Rick said. "I'd like to order a large pizza."

"Large, you say?" The guy on the other end of the line seemed a little taken aback, which was rather strange for a pizza place.

"Yeah," Rick continued, a little confused himself. "Could I get it mushrooms, sausage, olives and pinapple on that?"

"Of course," said the voice bruskly. "Will that be pick-up or delivery?"

"Delivery." The guy on the other end gasped loudly and slammed down the phone. "That's odd," thought Rick. "He didn't tell me how much it would cost or when I could expect it. He didn't even say 'thank you' or 'good bye.' I need to have a talk with Gino about how his employees treat customers." Rick turned on the tv and settled down to wait for his pizza.

Agent Smith walked briskly down the hall trying to not panic. A *large* pizza! this was going to be a big one and, apparently it involved nuclear weapons, genetic engineering, the Israelis and . . . whatever the hell pineapples are. There was no way that pineapples were anything good. Worse still, it was a delivery. It was coming right to American soil! He had to brief the president immediately. There was going to be a war unlike any the world had ever seen.

Five hours later, Rick still did not have his pizza and his favorite show had been interrupted by the president making a stupid speech about pineapples. Tonight was just not Rick's night.

#### [WP]You make a wish on a shooting star to be what your crush considers perfect. You wake up the opposite gender because it turns out your crush is gay.

Score: 1246

I walked to Nick's house that night a new man. It turns out that what Nick had wanted was a young man, about 6'3, with a charming smile and chiseled abs. What he saw as perfect was courage, and intelligence, and grace, and athleticism, and all those qualities I thought I lacked when I was the old me. But now I had them.
No, this wasn't a curse. I could live with this. Love is powerful. More powerful than sex, or gender. And I loved Nick, and I would be this for him.

I watched him from the tree outside his window. I was amazed at how easily I'd climbed the trunk. How would I introduce myself to him, though? As old Lisa Gray? Or as a new person? And If I stayed like this, what would I tell my parents? Was the old me dead?

But I watched him as he read in the nook of his window, broad shoulders resting on the glass, and I knew the old me was dead. I am only the parts of me that belong to him. 

The search for me went on for a few days. Apparently neighbors had seen a young man leaving Lisa's room through the window on the morning of her disappearance. Some people suspected murder or kidnapping, but there was no blood and no body.

I joined the school as a new student and tried out for the football team. Nick was one of the captains. My speed and strength helped me on, and so did Nick. As soon as he saw me he knew. I was perfect to him. I was the child of his dreams.

And from there we fell into each other. Every day, every night, in and out, climbing into each other's bedrooms. I was staying in a little motel just outside town. We made a little life there, together.

But then the law caught up. Someone recognized me as the young man who left Lisa's room that morning. One night, as Nick and I lay intertwined on the motel bed, we heard the approaching sirens. But we were both strong and fast and we leaped out the second floor window and landed in the fields out behind the motel.

We sprinted, side by side, out into the fields, into the darkness. But the dogs had our scent and followed, even more swiftly, through the grass. 

Nick fell into a shallow ravine. I heard the crack of his leg as the bone shattered on a rock. I couldn't move him, so we just laid together in the dirt and waited. I resolved to fight to keep us together. I would do anything. I knew he felt the same.

"I just wish we could get out of this," he said. He kissed me. And then I saw the star pass overhead.

When the police found us, they found the young man who was seen leaving Lisa's apartment wrapped lovingly around Lisa, who had fallen into a ravine and broken her leg.

The news story said that the two had decided to elope and were living in a motel outside of town for weeks. 

Nick was still Nick-- on the inside at least. On the outside he looked just like the old me, because he'd wished it-- the cops needed to find Lisa Gray for us to be together. He didn't mind after all, being me. He loves me, and love is more powerful than sex or gender.

And eventually, after all these years together, I've learned to love myself.

#### [WP] You have a massive reputation in the criminal underworld... and you have no idea why.

Score: 1246

I am not a violent man.

In fact, I was one of those kids at elementary school who would faint from just seeing the red fill up the needle, during flu shots. But I wasn't a bright kid either, so here I am nonetheless, making a living through crime in the adult life.

I am not a trustworthy man.

See, there was one thing I was good at, even as a kid. People. I know how to get them to like me, and I know how to make them do things that *I* want. The trick is to make it look as if they came up with your ideas. Go along with anything they say, make 'em think you're on their side, then sneak in a bit of what you want. That's how I became a confidence trickster.

I am not a wealthy man.

Funny, that. I'm good at conning, but conning will only get you so far. Once you fall outside the law, it's not the cunning that get the best of it. It's the killers. The big fish, the ones who hold all of the power, and none of the scrupules. The sharks. Once you start making too much as a simple con man, you're "treading in their waters". That's when they start making cuts, cuts in your money or cuts of a different kind. So, I've learned to keep my head down, stick to the small game.

I am not a nice man.

I've had many women in my life, young girls with stars in their eyes and easy minds, readily taken in by a good-looking man with a quick tongue and impressive lies to tell. Older women with rich husbands and a craving for more exciting lives. Recently it was Alina, young and well-endowed, but maybe brighter than was good for me.

"Have you noticed how people are looking at me lately?" I asked her, frowning while I took her arm and walked her across the lantern-lit streets. 

"What, you're surprised at that, with your devilish looks?" she said, smiling.

"No, it's more than that..." I trailed off, recognizing the man waiting for us on the corner. A knife glimmered in the streetlight, and I remembered his face as one of the organized muggers. It was too late to avoid him now, but maybe I could push Alina towards him and escape with my life and money in tact, if I ran the other way. I'd been getting bored of her anyway.

But then something unexpected happened. The man's face fell, and he quickly pocketed his knife, respectfully nodding at me. 

"Evening, sir, miss."

Alina nodded, and we walked past. My heart was racing. "See?! Just now, that man!"

"What, you're not used to people being polite to you?"

"No, that was a-, oh, never mind."

I tried to convince Alina to stay at my place that evening, but she said she'd be returning home. Since Alina wasn't comfortable with her parents seeing me for some reason, we kissed goodbye on my doorstep, leaving me to spend the night alone with my wonderings. That was the first incident.

I am not a brave man.

So when the Boss showed up to invite me over for dinner with his wife, I nearly pissed my trousers. You all know "the Boss": bit on the heavy side, never fully shaved, wears that funny hat. Got a big cigar. But he's got that glint in his eye, the glint that tells you to better have a good reason for taking up his time. But on that day, that glint wasn't there, because he was the one who'd come to me.

I was baffled. What had I done to deserve a personal visit from this guy, an *invitation*, from the biggest shark of them all? I barely knew him! All I knew was that anyone who got offed in this city, did so only with his permission. Or just as often, on his request. 

Declining was out of the question, of course. So I put on my best suit. Told my best jokes. Somehow, I made it through the evening. For the longest time, I thought it was all some horrible joke, that this was all a charade to teach me a lesson for something I'd done. I expected the gunmen to jump out from behind the curtains, the moment his wife excused herself. But no, the Boss poured me a brandy and offered me a cigar.

"So," he said in a serious tone. "Tell me how you did it."

"Did, uh, did what?" I asked, nervously. 

Ah, there it was, the old familiar glint. He took a long drag from his cigar, and grinned. "How'd you make my daughter fall for you, you smooth bastard! What, you thought a man like me, with my connections, wouldn't know? Alina might think she could keep it a secret, but you should know better."

I nearly choked on my brandy.

The Boss laughed, but there was a hint of menace to his voice. "Don't worry, my friend. I don't blame you. Alina's a very special girl. And she seems happier, now she's seeing you." He leaned over, and looked me in my watering eyes while I coughed one last time.

"Of course, it goes without saying," he said with that same glint in his eyes, "That the moment that happiness fades, we'll be having a different 'conversation'."

I nodded, and he slapped me on the back, grinning again.

There are many things that I am not.

But most of all, I am not a *lucky* man.

#### [WP] Aliens have finally reached Earth and, per Intergalactic Law, have sent their most average champion to win the planet. A device is sent to find the most average human to accept the challenge and duel for the fate of Earth. It's you.

Score: 1243

The gigantic stage was, frankly, a little unnecessary in my eyes, but they kept telling me over and over again that the TV networks had demanded it and so I had no choice. It had only been three days since they had come for me, the government van pulling up to my door and then the thunderous knocking until I answered. I suppose I could have said no then, but when the President of the USA asks a favour… well, it becomes tricky to refuse. 

The alien ship had landed in the middle of London, crushing about a square mile of densely populated housing, but that had soon been forgotten as soon as they stepped out onto their little balcony and started their broadcast. For Earth it was the first communication from a species born on another planet, but they didn't seem to be particularly worried. 

Hundreds of TV cameras focussed in on the tall green creature as it gracefully extended six arms from its body and grasped a piece of the ship that had unfolded up to where it’s ‘head’ seemed to be. It looked from side to side and then leaned in. A complex series of grunts and hums emerged from its body and for a moment there was a tinge of disappointment from the crowd, before the translation kicked in and it blared out in English from somewhere behind the alien. 

“**EARTH**, you have been challenged to the *ULTIMATE TEST OF A SPECIES.* The triphosphic people of Merillium have send out a CHALLENGE and YOU MUST reply. If you accept then you will need to nominate the statistically most normal human to fight to go up against the representative of Merillium in the *ultimate challenge*.”

“Should you prevail, you will be given your choice of technologies, including anti-gravity, interstellar space flight and the secret to getting stubborn stains out of cloth and fabric without bleaching. *What is your answer*?” 

It’s hard to know exactly what it accepted as its answer, but the massive cheer that followed its speech seemed to satisfy it. Most people who were there on that day now claim that they were just happy that they alien hadn’t immediately begun vaporising people and hadn’t even really been able to hear what it said, but the die was cast. 

That led to me. We had 24 hours to prepare and a mammoth task was undertaken by governments all over the world. After mass analysis of billions of people it turned out that I was the most “average” of all of humanity. Average height, weight, intelligence and even, sad to say, genital length, I was right in the middle of them all. 

Soon I was on a flight, heading for London with a dozen generals at my side, all briefing me on what to look for, what to say and how to act, but no one seemed to have any idea what I was about to come up against. By the time I arrived they had bulldozed several streets in front of the ship and created a wide flat area with a *massive* stage set up on it. Hundreds of cameras lined every area and the crowds had been pushed far, far back. 

I stood in the middle of the stage with Helena Campano, Spanish TV presenter and the chosen host of this unique TV spectacle and listened as she babbled away into her microphone. My eyes were glued to the ship, just waiting for something to emerge. At last, a crack appeared and a great ramp began to swing down, it was time. 

The green alien came first, dragging behind him a white box and then after him came a yellow creature that seemed to hiss in the air as it walked. Many scientists had speculated that a triphosphic alien would have difficulty surviving on our planet and so it seemed to be proving, but still they moved forward until they stood opposite me. 

Helena had moved back and I could hear her speaking rapid Spanish somewhere behind me but it was the alien whose voice was loudest. He seemed to still connect to his ship and the translations blared out at incredible volume. 

“WELCOME, this will be a single round fight TO THE DEATH.” He paused as if expecting applause but none was forthcoming. “PREPARE yourself human.” 

He stepped back and I was left facing the yellow hissing… thing. It was a shambling, roughly humanoid alien, with large black eyes at the top of its head and long arms that hung low, almost to the ground. I backed away, trying to get some sort of distance on the creature in front of me, but it shuffled after me quickly. 

A fight to the death? This was not exactly what I had signed up for… but it had been a possibility. There had been soldiers at one point, I think maybe SAS and they had tried to teach me some basic moves, but it had all been a blur. What was it they had said? Something about hitting hard and fast and hoping like hell. 

It came closer and on instinct I took a low clumsy swing with my foot and connected on what might have been its leg. It paused, looked down at where I had hit it and then exploded into a yellow cloud that covered the surrounding area in a thick yellow goo and sent the first alien scurrying back to my side. 

“CONGRATULATIONS humanity, your representative has been victorious and now it is time to choose your prize.” 

They had all been very specific about this and as the alien shoved his microphone type object in my face I spoke clearly. “Interstellar space flight, please.”

I was surprised that my voice was not amplified like the aliens, there was no noise at all from the giant speakers and just some grunts from the beast that went untranslated, but it replied almost immediately anyway. “WELL DONE and excellent choice human. You have chosen the secret to getting stubborn stains out of cloth and fabric without bleaching.” 

My head twisted around and I could suddenly see angry faces all around the stage. “Wait, what? No, hang on...” 

It ignored me and moved over to the white box and pulled out a brightly coloured package. Its voice had dropped low and silky. “Whether you are fighting an alien species or just keeping the kids clothes clean, you can trust in XXIXAK cleaner to get oil, blood or even Merillium goo out of any of your materials.” 

I felt a hand pulling at my clothes and a second later it had pulled off my jumper and stuffed it into the white box. “Look at how it keeps the colours fresh and the clothes crisp.” it pulled out my jumper and it was indeed very clean looking, but I felt it would be a poor move to compliment it. 

The alien looked around. “Now, as a species, how many packs can I put you down for?”

#### [WP] Obama and Putin are both secretly gay, and in love with each other. Recent world events are the result of them showing off and trying to impress each other.

Score: 1243

Obama dialed the number from his memory, his fingers moving without thought. After all, he had called it every day for the past four years straight.

As the dial tone rang, he waited with baited breath. It was silly, of course. He did so every time despite the same results. Yet, he could never get over the butterflies in his stomach.

“Hello?” the thick Russian droned.

“Vlad?” Obama whispered. “It’s me.”

“I know,” he chuckled. “Who else would be as hushed as a naughty child.”

Obama tried to reciprocate his laugh but it fell flat. It was always sounded that way when he spoke to him.

“Yeah, you’re right.” He paused. “How have you been?”

“Fantastic,” Putin responded. “And you?”

Obama glanced at the door. Then he peeked out the window, just to make sure no one was recording him. He had to be vigilant at all times.

“The First Lady is being a bitch, as always,” he sighed. “I can’t wait until we can finally be together.”

“You should divorce her,” Putin suggested. “I did with my she-devil. Best decision in my life.”

Obama shook his head. He cursed himself when he remembered he couldn’t see him.

“It’s not that easy. The Republicans are already up my ass about every little thing. The last thing I need is a divorce scandal.”

“I’d like to be up your ass.”

“Vlad!” he gasped. “Be serious. If I lose my beard, then it’s only a matter of time until they would find out about us.”

“Sorry,” Putin chuckled once again. “Why not show that you hate the gays? That’s what I did and no one suspects a thing from me.”

Obama rolled his eyes.

“Right, and have another Sochi incident? I may be in my second term but the last thing I want is to be the number one enemy of the ever-growing liberal population.”

“Then what do you want me to do? Something has to change.” Putin said, his voice with a façade of joviality. Underneath, an edge of criticism hid.

Obama bit his lip, prepared for the worse. He had the thought for months but was too afraid to ever say it. But he figured it was now or never.

“Move to America with me. I’ve been working my ass off to allow gay marriage. You could come here and we could live happily together, just the two of us. Maybe we could even go to Hawaii. It’s nice all year and no one could bother us.”

Putin said nothing. Only his light breathing gave any indication that we was still on the phone. Obama could hear his heart beat in his chest, blood rushing in his ears in a cadence of anxiety.

“It could never work,” he said. “You know that.”

Obama winced. His tone was as harsh as he expected.

“You never know until you try,” he suggested, hopeful to persuade him. “Something has to change, right?”

“I-I have to go,” Putin stammered. Was he crying? “There are much things that need to be done today.”

“Yes, I understand,” Obama said.

Silence reigned over their conversation once again. Neither had the will to hang up, taking in each other’s presence thousands of miles away. Even without words, they told each other so much by just existing.

And as Obama almost hung up, Putin said one last thing.

“When we met, do you remember it?”

Obama smiled, a wave of nostalgia washing over him.

“Of course. It was the summer of 2009. We met under your dacha. You were wearing a nice suit that complemented your blue eyes. Even back then, I felt the spark but I had no idea my wildest dreams come true.” He paused. “I love you, Vlad.”

If it was possible to hear some grin from ear to ear through the phone, Obama just did.

“I love you too.”

And with that, Putin hung up. Obama held the phone in his hand for a few more brief seconds in shock. He said it back. He couldn’t believe that he really the said the words he craved to hear. His head was spinning with an unearthly euphoria.

But a knock at the door forced Obama to collect his wily thoughts. In a mad scramble to look presentable, he disposed of the phone and straightened his collar. As the door swung open, he begrudgingly wiped his dopy smirk off of his face. One day, maybe he would be with the love of his life.

One day.

And I completely boned the entrance exam for Brazil; I forgot to check for a camera when infiltrating that bank vault."

Hans stabbed a meatball furiously and popped it into his mouth.

"Well, there's always your safety school..." Albert volunteered.

Hans sneered. "For fuck's sake," he said, spitting little chunks of meatball across the table. "You really think I want to become some bowing little Bond villain henchman? Come on. They're a complete joke! I mean, thanks to them, the normies actually know about ninja stars."

"Come on, Japan wouldn't be *that* bad. There are plenty of great ninjas who have trained in Japan and gone on to do some really sneaky work! I mean, I could name like 20 off the top of my head..."

"Yeah," Hans interrupted. "You *can* name them off the top of your head. That's the problem!"

He shook his head and poked at another meatball. "Dad is going to disown me. I might as well drop out of ninja training altogether and go work for the Illuminati or something."

"Greg," he answered, unable to think of any other words.  "My name is Greg," he added, once more came to him.

The girl raised an eyebrow.  "Wow, you look just like my friend, Josh."

"Is this- is this a *joke*?" asked Greg, in a harsher tone than he intended.

"No," she said.  "You look *exactly* like him."

"My twin brother's name was Josh."

The girl almost fell backwards.  "Josh mentioned something about a twin brother too.  I think his name was Greg.  Unfortunately, he died a long time ago."

"*My* name is Greg."

"Is *this* a joke?" asked the girl with a sneer.  "It's not funny, Josh."

"Hey, Pam," a voice called.  A mirror image of Greg approached the pair.

"Who are you talking to?" the newcomer asked.

Pam scanned the area to find they were alone.  "Where did he go?" she asked.

"Who?"

"Nobody," said Pam after a pause.  "Listen, Josh, I know this is going to sound weird, but is there anything you'd want to tell your brother Greg if you had the chance?"

Josh felt his heart rise up in his chest.  "I'd tell him that I love him and I miss him every day."

Pam leaned in and gave Josh a hug.  "If I ever see him," she said.  "I'll pass along the message."

Life was okay until I turned two. The body and brain can’t utilize past knowledge much before then. But once I turned two, oh boy.

“Jerry somebody’s broken in.” I heard my mom whisper to my dad.

*What? I don’t remember our house ever being broken into. And my parents would’ve told me about that at some point for sure. Our family didn’t keep secrets like that.*

“I told you I should’ve gotten that Glock.” My dad whispers back. I can hear voices downstairs now. Several of them, and several bolts being pulled back to chamber rounds in what sounds like are very large guns.

“We’ve got to protect the baby.” My mom tells my dad.

*No, this baby’s got to protect you.* I roll out of my bed and hit the ground. Thankfully being a baby I am very light weight and therefore make very little noise. I run to the top of the stairs before my dad can open his door to sneak over to my room.

I move noiselessly to the base of the stairs and peak around the corner.

A normal person would be scared at a group of thugs stacking up on the stairwell like a SWAT team. A normal person would’ve probably begged for their life when they saw all the assaults rifles, shotguns, and body armor. A normal toddler would’ve wet themselves and passed out. But a normal toddler also didn’t do three tours in Afghanistan.

“It’s him!” The first one shouts, bringing his gun to bear. I’m too weak to fight him directly so I dive under him, pulling the pin on one of his grenades as I duck under.

“Don’t let…” I cut the second guy off with a strategic punch to his reproductive organs, and sprint into a nearby bathroom, jumping into the tub and covering my head just in time to hear the grenade go off.

*This is going to be an interesting childhood.*

I stood at the edge of the Pacific forest. I looked back at my camera crew; it was going to be a long walk. We had enough to keep everything working. All of our equipment was solar powered. I was the host of a T.V show called 'Never been there' where the entire point was to go places that no modern people had ever been. The first season had been pretty tame, but my hosting skill got us to cult status. The network wanted an event, and we were taking the risk of the long way across the Pacific. Miles of evergreen laid out before me. The Pacific was home to the evergreens, which meant we could have done this during the winter when more things were asleep. 

We had chosen not to.

I took the first steps into the forest and started to walk, head high and to wander in. It was bravery for the shot. We wouldn't be filming for the next few days, so after this shot we could all take it easy. After passing a few trees, I turned back to the crew, "That kay?"

"Looks ominous enough I think," he waved me over, and I waltzed back over, watching myself go into the trees again, I looked confident. The sun was low enough that nightfall was beginning in the forest. It was a good shot. I had him play it again while I stroked the stubble I had grown over the past three days of prep to look rugged, "Good enough," I said, "they can edit that in post if they want to, but we should get in there."

There were 7,800 miles between me and the other side of the Pacific. We were going to walk the entire thing. If we kept a good pace, it would take us six months walking around 13 hours a day. Seeing as we were going to take it pretty easy, we had allotted eight months to pull this off. Our cell equipment should work anywhere in the forest, but rescue crews could only go so far. We were supposed to place beacons down every 100 miles. Once we got 400 miles in they were going to drop off more so that we could have a full 78.

I nodded forward, "If we are going to use that shot we can get going right?" Cheryl our camera woman nodded and came with. We were a team of Six. Cheryl, Alex, Jesse, Syd, Roger and me Everett West. Together we were going to conquer the Central Pacific for the first time in properly recorded history. Damn that was a nice sound byte, I should make sure to record that later for the sake of the intro.

We only went around 30 miles on the first day before we were sitting around a campfire. We didn't need the warmth; it was damn summer. The trees were already bigger than most of the ones that I had seen in my lifetime. There were a 
few near the coast of Cali that hit these sizes, but not many. It had been quiet for a few minutes when Cheryl piped up, "So who dies first?"

I sighed, "I bet on Roger last time, but he keeps making it, so Jesse."

"Me?" Jesse asked running his hand through his blonde hair, "I'm always fine."

"Yeah but you can't dye your hair for eight months," Cheryl said, "So my money is on you too."

"Seven," Jesse said, "fucking seven or my Sandra," Jesse's wife "is going to kill me."

"We scheduled eight," I said as I started to laugh, "you're fucked."

"Dude, it's our anniversary," He said, "if one of you guys breaks a leg or some shit and makes us slow I'm just going to run ahead." There was a brief pause, "and Everett dies first."

"Ballsy," Roger said as he was working on one of the tents, "he's the host if he goes we are fucked."

"Most watched videos on the internet are of people dying," I said as I turned to face him, "that or Korean chicks singing."

Syd said something in Korean. I knew enough to know that she was swearing at me; I didn't know enough to say which word it was. I just laughed it off; we were going to give each other shit over the next eight months, but we were going to live. 

We were going to make one hell of a show doing it too.

#### [EU] Marty McFly walks in on his parents arguing about why he looks like their friend from high school.

Score: 1235

"I haven't even *seen* Calvin since that dance, OK? He just *disappeared!*" Lorraine's voice had clear notes of exasperation from having to argue about this *again*. 

"But you did look for him, didn't you?" George accused. "Even after we were a couple, you went by his Uncle's house to find him, right?"

"Well... I..." she sputtered, "*of course* I looked for him, but only because I was worried! He could have been dead by the side of the road or something. You know that Biff had it out for him. And he didn't show up to school, or..."

"Oh, *save it*, Lorraine!" George was probably red in the face already. "I get it, OK? I've heard that song of his on the radio from Chuck Berry. I know women all want to be with rockstars and whatever. So you tried to find him again, and from the looks of our son, you certainly succeeded!"

"George, how can you even say that? I've *never seen him since that night!* I don't know what I can say that will convince you!"

There was a tense silence. Marty unpaused his video game downstairs, pretending that he wasn't listening in on the fight. It had become a daily occurrence in the McFly household, and he already knew how this would end. Just in time, he heard his father come stomping down the stairs. 

"Hey, Dad!" Marty said cheerfully, not taking his eyes off the screen. He'd taken on a role of defusing the tension in the household. Soon enough they'd forget all about the fight and go back to life as usual. Well, till the next one that is. "How about we order some chinese for dinner?" It was Dad's favorite. Marty thought he heard a sob from his parent's room upstairs.

George didn't answer right away. He just stood in the doorway. Marty paused the video game and looked back to see tears rolling down his father's face. And there was a suitcase in his hand. "Dad?" Marty managed to utter. This wasn't right. This had never happened before. 

"I'm sorry, so..." His father started to call him 'Son' as normal, but couldn't get the word out. "Marty. I'm sorry, *Marty*. Your mother will explain everything to you. Just..." he sighed heavily. "Goodbye, Marty." 

Marty was paralyzed by shock as George picked up the suitcase and walked out the door. He should have done something. Should have stopped him. Should have tried to explain that it was absolutely impossible for him to be his own father. That it was a time paradox that would probably destroy the universe. But he couldn't say any of those things. 

There was a knock on the door. Marty didn't know how long it had been. Hours, maybe? He'd just been staring at the wall, imagining what he could have said to make his father stay. But now he was back! Marty leaped off the couch and flew to the atrium without pausing to consider why his father would bother knocking on his own front door.

Doc Brown's bushy mane and wild eyes greeted Marty at the door. "Marty!"

Marty's smile collapsed. "Oh. Sorry, Doc. I thought you were..."

"Your father, yes!"

Marty stared. "How did you..."

"Oh, trust me, Marty... this is a critical moment in your history that has vast repercussions!" He gave an exaggerated shudder. "You don't even want to know what happens to you in this timeline. Or to your parents!" He shook his head like he was clearing those horrible memories out. "I thought that we'd cleaned up every loose end from 1955, but apparently not! We forgot that the *memories* would endure, Marty! We need to fix it!"

For the first time, Marty looked over Doc's shoulder to see the Delorean glowing in the driveway. "Oh *no*," Marty said. "That always causes problems, Doc!"

"We have to, Marty! We have to go back to 1985 and prevent you from ever going to 1955 in the first place!"

#### [WP] After years of gentile persuasion your best friend since childhood finally agrees to seek professional help for serious mental problems. Much to your dismay, as she begins to improve you slowly start to realize that you are her imaginary friend.

Score: 1233

After years of friendship I felt bold enough to start making suggestions, subtle hints that I thought he needed professional help. I loved him and wanted nothing more than for him to be happy. 


I had moved into town when Spencer was ten, right after he lost his older brother and the use of his left hand in a car accident. When we first met he seemed so empty and vacant. His cold blue eyes looked at the world in the way that a drowsy child looked at a television screen while watching late night talk shows. It was as if he wasn’t processing life as it happened around him, without him. We bonded over our love for cartoons and our mutual belief that plain potato chips were superior to any other lunch snack. In no time we were spending recess together, playing elaborate games of make believe until the bell summoned us back to class. With a gap-riddled toothy grin, he told me that I made him feel normal again, like he could be himself when he was with me. I told him that he was my best friend and we innocently held hands on our way to lunch. I would smile bashfully every subsequent time that his warm, usually sweaty, palm made contact with mine.


Initially, I loved feeling needed. It was flattering to know that another human being depended on me. But, as we grew older I started to notice that he had become entirely reliant on me for happiness. It wasn’t healthy so I began to suggest that he seek help. At first, I brought it up in casual conversation.


“I love you, but I shouldn’t be the only thing that makes you happy,” I remarked, hoping he knew that I wasn’t trying to push him away.


“I still need you. There are other things that make me happy, but I still need you.”


At the time, I didn’t understand what that was supposed to mean: he still needed me. Still. As if there was potential for an end to our friendship. Months went by and I continued push, injecting little hints here and there until he caved.


“I did it,” he said to me with a look of solemn pride, like a warrior who'd just returned from a long and bloody battle.


“What?”


“I went to see a therapist, like you said.”


“Great! What did they say?”


He sighed laboriously and shook his head, opening his mouth to speak and then pausing to close his lips again. After a few repetitions of this odd ritual his eyes met mine, cautiously licking his lips, and he began to speak.


“We can’t do this anymore. It’s not healthy for me. I’m sorry.”


I looked at him, my previously joy-filled face melted away into an expression of hurt confusion, brows tugging together tightly and tears building up in my eyes as I tried to process exactly what he meant. 


“Do what?”


“This. The talking, the friendship, the love. It’s not real.”


“But I love you,” I bawled, slowly dragging the back of my hand along my cheek to clear my face of tears, leaving a damp streak in its path .


“I love you too, that’s the problem. None of this is real.”


“Of course it’s real! You are my whole world.”


“I know.”


His head hung low and shook again before he walked away, dragging his beat up sneakers along the cracked sidewalk. Desperately, I began to chase after him but found myself unable to gain any actual speed. As if I were in a dream, I was no longer in control of my interaction with the physical world. The harder I tried, the slower I moved. Frantic and confused, I looked down to my feet which, to my surprise, were becoming increasingly transparent with each passing second. I quickly threw my head back up to look at Spencer, eyes wide and bulging in petrified hysteria.


“Please... What’s happening? Spencer, come back!”


He didn’t even turn around and before I could I try to beg again, everything was gone. I was surrounded by black nothingness and left to ponder the impossibility of what had happened. Who was I? What was I?


It took a long time for me to come to terms with the fact that I was nothing. I was a figment of the imagination of a damaged child. A child who needed a friend. I hated myself for encouraging him to get help because my suggestions had lead to my own demise.


Now, though, I am at peace. I served my purpose. Not many people get to say that. Not many people, within an entire lifetime, get to know what their purpose is at all. I had a job and I completed it. He doesn't need me anymore and as long as that is true, I know I can be happy.

As the seas begin to boil and radioactive dust blots out the sun, you feel the summons begin to pull on your essence. You're not particularly surprised, as you've been expecting this moment for eons. You're more resigned than anything else, really.

With a last, sorrowful glance you let yourself go. It was fun while it lasted.

A small shift in reality, a slight warping of space, and you stand before two kings. 
Although they do not wear any vestiges that proclaim themselves to be kings, merely being in their presence is enough to unequivocally convince anyone of what they are. 

They frown at you. They do not know you, and for them you are a mystery. They quite frankly don't know what to make of you. 

"Who the hell are you?" says Lucifer. 

"Why in My blazes are you here?" asks God. 

God motions, and you're aware they he just tried to erase you from existence. It tickles.

 You smile at them. They really have no idea.

Did they really not see this coming? Smug in their superiority, did they never wonder what was going to happen at the end of time? As their timeless war leaves everything desolate, when all other life has been eradicated? Smug bastards.

Score: 1223

Standing in that timeless room, I knew the truth of my life. My mind ran on an endless loop just like everybody else’s, recounting everything I’d ever done up to that point. “So I guess it’s my turn,” I said as I took the stage, microphone in hand. 44 was far too few to see out there, and sixteen or seventeen of them were hardly worth counting.

“Just get on with it 45,” 24 shouted from the back.

“So I know some of you are getting tired of hearing this speech year after year, but you’ll be hearing it for the rest of your life, so you better get used to it.” Nobody laughed, as usual. “You probably shouldn’t make that joke next year, 44.” He would. He always did.

“Gentlemen, raise your glasses with me.” Thirty-eight glasses went up with mine. 1 through 4 didn’t know what the hell was going on, 6 was too busy picking his nose, and 20 had already passed out drunk at the table.

“This toast is to a lifetime of memories, both the good and the bad. As I speak, I want each of you to look back on your year and be honest with yourself.” 

I cleared my throat and started with the next cycle of memories.

“Take a sip with me for every kind word said, and pour one out for every word you regret.”

A second passed, and more was poured out than in.

“Take a sip with me for every truth you told when it wasn’t convenient, and pour one out for every lie you told when it was.”

A second passed, and 15 was the last to pour, finally convinced he should tell his parents his real grades.

“Take a sip with me for every time you tried your hardest, and pour one out for every time you gave up on something you cared about.”

A second passed, and 18 drank immediately, smiling proudly as he relived the basketball team’s run in the tournament. 21 poured one out, wondering why he’d let her go.

“Take a sip with me for every promise you kept, and pour one out for every promise you broke.”

A second passed, and 19 poured one out as he realized he’d broken a promise a year in the making. He told her they’d get back together come summer. How would he tell her that he’d found someone better?

“Take a sip with me for every friend that you made, and pour one out for every tie that you severed.”

A second passed, and 10 realized the sip he poured out meant more than the ten he took in.

“Take a sip with me for every time you told somebody you loved them and meant it, and pour one out for every time that you didn’t.”

A second passed, and 24 poured his glass out while 16 finished his and they both poured themselves new ones.

“Take a sip with me for every time you fell in love, and pour one out for every heart that you broke.”

A second passed, and 24 poured his glass out again as 16 took three sips, and 15 stole an extra sip to help himself forget what saw.

“Take a sip with me for every hug that you gave; two for every kiss; three if it was your mother; four if it was your kid.”

A second passed, and 5 through 22 drank healthily, 23 through 39 drank just for their kids; 40 and on didn’t drink at all.

“Take a sip with me for every time you tried something new.”

A second passed, and 32 realized he was the only one not drinking and started to wonder why.

“Take a sip with me if you took a step toward accomplishing your dream.”

A second passed, and only half took a sip, and only half of the half took more than one.

“Take a sip with me if you honestly think you are happy.”

A second passed, and 7 raised his glass, but lowered it when he realized he was the only one. 

“Now take a sip with me if you think that’s something worth changing.”

All bottoms were up before a second had passed. 

“Now everybody finish your drink for all the good times we’ve had, and then finish another for tonight, because this is my last night here with you and we damn well better make the most of it.”

#### [WP] You're midway into your flight when you, feeling bored, decided to surf the Internet. You read breaking news about another plane disappearance. You're on that flight.

Score: 1221

This was the first flight I've been on where I was bored enough to pay for Wifi. I had a window seat, but we were heading through thick fog. I had loaded my phone with games, but the battery died. The inflight movie was Daddy Day Care 3, for god's sake. I thought they only made that to use as punishment in CIA interrogations. I couldn't take it anymore; I reached around my neighbor's elbow, who was generously taking up the entire armrest, and got out my wallet.

Naturally, I loaded up Reddit first. Normally, I stick to a limited number of subreddits but today I just wanted to zone out and see some cat pictures in /r/all. And yet, even Reddit was against me: the top stories were all focused on yet another plane crash. *Perfect to read while flying*,  I thought. I almost skipped over the story, but one detail in the headline grabbed my attention: the flight had left from Raleigh, just like mine. It's not a huge airport. I'd probably seen all of those passengers on their way to their plane! How creepy.

I didn't believe the information in the text. United Flight 617 on its way to Denver... that was *my* flight. I even got out my little ticket stub to check. There has to be some kind of mistake. A different post loaded.... exact same information. I checked CNN; if they can do one thing, it's cover a missing plane. They had the exact same information. 

I managed to crawl over the mountain of a man in the middle seat and made my way down the aisle to the stewardess taking drink orders up in first class. I thrust the tablet into her hands. "What is *this*?" I practically screamed.

She ushered me away from the rich people and back to my seat. "Just a mistake, sir. The pilots are sorting it out now. Everything is fine with the plane." She shoved a mini bottle of vodka into my hand and winked. "How about you just relax, and we'll be arriving soon."

Well, if the pilots knew about it, then that was OK. Clearly the plane was still flying, right? 

I was just buckling my seatbelt when I happened to glance out the window. We'd left the cloud bank, and I had a clear view of the slate grey ocean below, spreading out in every direction. It didn't click immediately as I gazed out.

*There's no ocean on the way to Denver*...

I leapt from my seat and raced after the stewardess. She made it to the back of the plane just in time and saw me coming down the aisle after her. She slammed a metal grate closed that blocked off the little back compartment where they kept all the food. She looked directly at me and shook her head slowly with a sad smile. The other flight attendants peered around their corner and rolled their eyes. "How did he find out?" one of them said. From one of the uppermost compartments, they pulled out gas masks and strapped them on. 

"We're ready," she said into the mic. The mask filter made her voice odd and robotic There was a brief pause, and then the red hazard lights turned on

"We're sorry to have to do this," The Captain announced over the intercom. That was the only explanation he gave as thick smoke began to seep into the cabin. Some of the other passengers stood and looked around, wondering what that cryptic message meant. Then they too noticed the gas filling the cabin, and began pawing at the little compartment where oxygen masks were supposed to drop from. I rattled the grate as hard as I could while the flight attendants just looked on, slightly amused. Like looking at a zoo animal. 

My eyes grew heavy, and I sank to the floor as everything went black.

#### [WP] The US government sends Bob Ross back in time to help Hitler get accepted into Art School.

Score: 1218

Bob Ross strapped into a leather chair, his hair bobbing ever so slightly. 

"Are you sure about this, Bob? You could be killed. We need to be absolutely clear with you about the dangers present," the Time Delegation representative said firmly. "I know you've been training to speak German for some time in preparation, but if you find yourself unsure on the other side, disaster could befall us."

A warm smile crept across Bob's face. "I'm sure. You said this will prevent future catastrophe, right?"

"Yes, sir. It would likely allow for an Israeli state to be created with less haste, preventing the fighting and nuclear fallout that follows. I come from a time when that has already happened. We've tried to kill him, but it fails every time."

"I'd save millions in the past, and millions in the future. What better purpose could my life serve? I will try, my friend. Let's turn this mess into a beautiful, peaceful painting for the future."

The doors shut, engines whirred and within moments, Bob found himself in 1908 Austria outside of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where Hitler had just failed admission for the second time. Using several older photos for reference, he kept an eye on the entrance.

Several minutes later, Adolf stormed out of the building, throwing his paintings and screaming curses in German. Bob approached him once he'd sat down and cooled his head for a moment.

"Are you an artist?" Bob asked carefully.

Hitler looked up at him, sighing. "I am not. This school has rejected me twice now, so clearly I am no such thing."

"Schools have nothing to do with it; art comes from your soul. May I see your work? I am an artist as well."

Hitler pointed to the partially snapped painting on the ground. "I destroyed it in anger."

Picking it up, Bob verbally gaped at it. "This is incredible. You have extreme technical talent, unlike much I've seen."

"Thank you. Unfortunately, that's not enough, it seems."

"No, my friend. It's not. My name is Hans- what is yours?"

"Adolf. Are you from around here? Your accent is odd."

"I grew up overseas, but I love this country. Hey- do you have a studio?"

"I have a place I draw, yes."

"Can we maybe work a little together there? I think we could help each other."

Hitler looked down at the cement. "I quit art. There's nothing for me in this field."

"Oh, that's not true! You have too much talent to waste, friend. I would love a little help regarding precise measurements and detailed architecture. Schools are schools- don't let them tell you who you are."

Hitler marveled at Bob's warm smile and friendliness. "Sure. Yes, we can go now."

They sat together in a small room, each with their own easel. Bob was scraping paint into a beautiful snowy forest, and Adolf was once again working on an architectural piece. 

"Adolf, why don't you try mixing our ideas?"

"How do you mean?"

"Well, you draw amazing architecture, and I am a landscape master. I think if you drew a beautiful building against a backdrop of nature rather than a pure cityscape, I think it would give it life. See, a piece needs *life* and *personality* on top of skill. You are incredibly skilled, so much that you forget about the soul of it."

Adolf chewed on that for a moment, while continuing his building. He accidentally stroked too hard, leaving a blemish on the rooftop.

"Shit. Ah, see, I always mess up. Now I have to start over."

Bob smiled, placing a hand on his shoulder. "There are no mistakes, just happy little accidents." He swiped the blemish into an accent, shaping it into a bird and adding color.

"It's about the feeling, Adolf. It's about *you*."

He smiled and they continued to paint the day away.

*Your Mother and Father are already dead*. That's what my grandmother told me, many years ago, when she was still alive.

Well, they weren't dead. They were sitting on either side of me, my father frowning and not saying anything, my mother crying, clutching my arm with both of her hands and saying, "Don't go. Don't go," through a stream of tears. 

Despite the fact that both of my parents still drew breath, my grandmother was right. 

"I have to go."

"You don't," My father said, "You don't have to go. There is no reason to make your mother upset this way, David."

My mother's voice was almost unintelligible through the tears, "-everything you nee-heed. Why? Why would- *sob* go?"

I had already explained it to them a hundred times. At first, my father laughed. It wasn't until I ripped them both away from their screens, and made them sit down at the kitchen table, and *listen*, that they started taking me seriously. 

I would start out on a ship, the lowest rank. In the past, I might've been lucky to get an intern position, but with the drought of employees in the last few decades, they had promised me a ranking position.

In ten years, they said, if I stuck it out, I could get my own ship.

"This is a rebellion, isn't it?"

I could feel the heat rising in my face. I wanted to tell them, yes, that's exactly what this was - I refused to live like them, to glue myself to this perfect place, and never look up.

But I couldn't lie to them, not now. Everything was already so fragile.

"No, that's not it."

"Then why? Tell us why!"

"Son, we live in *paradise*. You can eat what you like, live where you like, *do* what you like. There is no reason-" 

I wasn't listening. It wasn't anything new. Nothing here was ever new.

In my head, I could feel my grandmother's words, more than I could hear them. They were like those massive bells you saw in the History programs, the kind that used to hang from old, stone towers, and boomed so loud, you would go deaf if you were too close.

*Your mother and father, they are already dead. They grew up in this dream of a perfect world - a society that provides for the desires of every single person. Only, there is one thing they can never provide.*

*What's that, Grandmom?*

*There is a word, you won't hear it often now, though it was once so common as to be called 'cheap.' That word is Wanderlust; it means the love of exploration. You see, your parents think that this, here, is the future. They think the future is Now. But it isn't Now. The future is never Now. The future is always out there, waiting for you to catch it.*

I pushed myself off the couch, and told them I was going. My mother pawed at my jacket, sobbing.

My father tried to block my way. But it had been a long time since he had done anything outside of his comfort zone, and he was not used to exerting his will on others. I push him away, gently.

I told them I loved them. I told them I'd see them, when I had the chance. 

I walked out of my house, and into my future.

 "What's your zombie plan?"

Oh, how many hours we all wasted, people young and old, on that fun little hypothetical. Friends and family would be judged mercilessly on their choices. "The mall? The mall? It's over populated - too many bodies!"

But when the first few grey hands punched up out of fresh graves, people lost their shit. We'd joked about it, but we weren't really ready. Well some people were ready - the real wackos, you know the ones - but everyone else was just standing about, hands on their cheeks, mouths wide like we'd just slapped on some of Dad's after-shave.

We all stood in dumbfounded awe as the buried unburied themselves and the morgues went from being filled to being populated. It was all on the news - by which I mean social media, no one watches the news - and we were all struck by how anti-climactic the whole thing was.

They, the recently undeaded, didn't seem interested in feasting on human flesh at all. They were actually quite chipper and polite - obviously there was somewhat of a communication barrier, it's hard to sound out syllables when your jaw has rotted off, but slowly we worked out a communicatory shorthand.

Grannies the world over were back in the kitchen, though their scent often overpowered the smell of their once famous and fondly remembered baked-goods. Families were reunited, loves lost were found, fighting over the interpretation of wills was settled. It was good! People got to say the things that had not been said. But, the instant explosive over population wasn't great.

Also, I, and many others, felt a little bit guilty. My Nan was in an urn on the mantlepiece. I had had her cremated. She couldn't really get up and walk around, being ashes and all.

The urn does wobble at me though - judging me from it's place next to the picture of my dog.

They, the re-living, were pretty keen to keep why they had come back a secret. When we asked the question, they changed the subject. But, finally they cracked, a few spilled the beans and soon everyone found out just why the dead had left the afterlife and come back.

We couldn't believe it.

It had always been free, the afterlife, but now it was pay-to-rest-in-peace. Dying got you access to the base package, but all the fun stuff cost money. Turns out some gaming execs had passed over and had manged to weasel their way into management positions.

The bastards.

Score: 1214

"Yo Trey, you did say Ginger was going to be bringing the guns right, I mean ALL of the guns.  You know we need that heavy shit bro."  

Thomas Bower, A.K.A Tiny Tommy, A.K.A Tommy Two Guns had a nervous edge in his voice, not because he was afraid his crew was going to be shorted by this buyer.  He was afraid that it would go bad and he would be exposed and killed.  

This was his last undercover job, and he was only 5 months from retirement after all.  He had seen enough movies to be worried about how this was going to play out.  

Trey looked Tommy over for a moment and replied, "Yeah no worries, this guy is solid."

Thomas nodded, this was a highly uncoordinated operation, everything balanced on the tip of a needle here but he couldn't let his weakness show.  
He stared at Trey's feet for a few moments and considered things...

___________________________________________________________

"So, what are you packing tomorrow?"  Alex Trevoski asked Tommy.

"You think we need to be packing?  I thought your guy was solid...  I wasn't expecting a god damned Mexican standoff or anything."

Alex was worried.  Tommy was clearly not all he claimed to be, he was no true gangster.  He was the type who was likely to go off the handle and kill somebody.  

"Nah bro, I just meant, I was asking you is all because you don't need to is my point."  Alex wanted to keep as many guns out of the hands of this gang as possible, the buyer was to keep them locked in a chest until payment, for his own safety.  Alex had almost ruined the deal putting that implication on it, it made it sound as if Ginger wasn't safe coming to sell his guns.  He had just assured the man that the police couldn't simply look in a locked container without a warrant, and Ginger seemed reassured.  

"Get EVERYONE out of this safe, that's the goal."  Alex never wanted this assignment, but nobody was going to die if he could help it.

"Alright Agent Mackland, are you ready to bust these guys?"  LT Maramow asked his agent.  He didn't like the man's off the book attitude, but damn did he get results.  

"Yes sir."  Burt replied, "This should prove to be a rather boring day, aside from the bust of several criminals.  All our men are in place and this should go smoothly."  He scratched his head, the red dye made his hair itch.  

"Alright, lets get you wired up, Ginger." 

_________________________________________________________

Three men sat in the warehouse, waiting.  

Each of them was trying to act hard, but if you looked closely you could see that something wasn't quite right.  

There was a loud ringing sound, the doorbell.  Bruno walked over, one hand at his side as if he meant to draw, and opened the bay door and let in the truck.  He turned to look at Tommy and Trey, they were as on edge as he was it seemed.  

The man "Ginger" came out and introduced himself.  

The group spoke of trivial things for a moment or two, and then the question was asked by Ginger, A.K.A Burt Mackland, "So do you got the money?"  

All three other men seemed to look wearily at each other, but they did in fact have the money.  

Ginger went to open the truck door to reveal the products and several things happened at once.  

Trey, Tommy and Bruno had drawn weapons and were sweeping the room with them, unsure who to aim at.  When the truck door swung upwards, 4 more armed men jumped out yelling, Ginger was also armed now.  

Everybody was screaming at once, if you listened carefully it sounded like they were uncoordinatedly singing the alphabet through the gibberish.  

A shot was fired, and answered with more shots.  For 45 seconds the shots and screams rang out, blurring together.  

That is the story of how the ATF, FBI and City Police lost a combined total of 8 good men that day due to a miss communication.

The judge rambles on some rigmarole about the course of justice. Then the prosecutor outlines the horrors charged against the man beside me.

It's my turn to speak now. I stand then turn to the judge and say the same thing I have every other time we've been here. The same routine. I say my piece so this guy walks and I go home and try to drink myself to death.

#### [EU] A game of Civ from the perspective of the original warrior unit.

Score: 1210

"We're doomed," Og whispered, clutching at the handle of his stone ax that he'd relied on so much through the years. Artillery fire echoed through the streets, from so many tiles away that the cannons weren't even visible.

"No!" Gred shouted, lifting his own weapon high to rally the men. "Do not lose hope!"

"Do you not see them?" Og answered, gesturing past the crumbling city wall to the fields beyond. Lines of musketman filled the low hills circling the northern border, taking advantage of the terrain bonus. Smoke wafted into the sky from the pillaged gem mine that had pleased the citizens of this fine city for so many years.

"I see them, Og. I know that they have superior firepower. But I trust in our Commander."

"All is lost, Gred! Our precious few resources have been squandered on a useless caravel, sent to explore the other side of the world! Our leader chose to emphasize *culture*, for God's sake! Our capital city doesn't even have a *library*, much less any Wonders. And we don't even have the iron necessary to make swords for us. And now," he said, pointing to the troops massing for their attack, "We're being overrun by *industrial era* forces when we've barely hit the Rennaissance! How do you think it is going to end?"

Gred furrowed his brow. "You have forgotten so much, brother. Do you remember the barbarian invasion of 1250 BC, in which our order valiantly defended the one civilian we had improving land tiles? How we fought off *three* different invading units? Then how we counter-attacked and destroyed their camp, earning *25 gold*? Or how about when Japan created its first settler, and we seized the unit before they could establish another city? A peace was brokered shortly after, but we stunted the growth of their civilization for the rest of history! Or when Arabia's units came calling, and we fought down to the last man? It took time for us to heal, but we overcame! And we can do it again, Brother Og, if you just have faith in the leader."

Og just sneered, but had no response. Then the order came down: vacate the city, and move into the fields. Right between the city and the encroaching invaders.

"We'll be killed!" Og wailed as he marched forward. "We're just stalling for one more turn until the inevitable demise of the city!"

Gred's jaw was set with grim determination. "To die so that replacement units have more time to train is an honor, Og. Maybe we'll even take one or two of them with us. Be brave, man."

The squad of warriors marched out of the city gates. Golden wheat waved around them in the gentle breeze. Gred could feel the eyes of the musketmen on the ridge above him, taking sight with their rifles or sharpening their bayonets. There was no apprehension or fear in their faces; only impatience. Their greedy eyes looked past the warriors, hungrily coveting the city beyond. "Not so fast," Gred growled, more to himself than to the countless enemies. "You still have to go through us." And then the turned ended.

For a brief moment, everything was still. Then drums sounded from above. Gred and Og turned to face the oncoming foe rushing down the hillside. A volley of shots rang out, and half the warriors dropped dead in an instant. Gred stared straight ahead, trying not to look into the lifeless eyes of his former comrades as they bled out into the wheat. "For the Empire!" he shouted, once the musketmen were close enough. The few remaining warriors launched themselves forward with ferocious battlecries and stone axes raised high. 

Another volley rang out, and half of the remaining men dropped. But Gred and Og made it into the enemy lines. Gred sank his axe into the closest soldier's neck, as he had done so many times before. It didn't matter what weapon the other men had; they all died the same way. Together, Gred and Og fought, blocking bayonets and countering with their sharp stone blades that had served them so well for countless centuries. 

When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, Og was left standing with a bloodsoaked axe. The musketmen were retreating up the hill, licking their wounds.

"We did it, Gred!" he shouted. All of his negativity and fear had melted away in the heat of battle. Gred had been right! He should have trusted him all along.

Only silence answered. Og soon found Gred's body, pierced by a dozen bayonets. His hand still clutched at his ax, ready to take on the Empire's enemies even in death. Og was the only one left.

He returned to the center of the field that he'd been ordered to hold. From the west, he heard rumbling and saw an approaching cloud of dust. A cavalry charge.

"For Gred," he whispered to himself as he hefted his ax high.

Score: 1208

I sat in my leather chair and leaned back. "Have you ever played civilization?" I asked the investigator.

"I don't really see how that's relevant sir. We just want to know how you ended producing a democracy from a criminal empire."

"There's a sort of in-joke about the game called one more turn syndrome. You plan to stop at the end of your turn and move onto something else. But, in one more turn you finish your research, then after that you finish your building, then Gandhi declares war on you."

"What? Gandhi declares war on you?"

"yeah there's this funny integer overflow prob- you know that's not really relevant. Anyway, you have all these things about to happen so you tell yourself just one more turn. Then it's 6 in the morning and you have work in forty minutes."

"Can you hurry and get to the point please?"

I leaned back and took a sip of my drink "To put it simply we wanted to be prepared, cover our bases, fill the holes in the organisation, cross the t's and dot the i's etcetra etcetra. We wanted to make things foolproof, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion, RICO brings down tons of organisations similar to ours. It was a massive undertaking and there was always so much to do and cover before we committed a crime. Just one more gap to fill, just one more backup plan, just one more turn. Does it make more sense now?"

"I think, but I don't see how you go from a secure organisation to a democracy."

"I'm getting to that. Anyway, we wanted to make sure we had a final backup plan, if all else fails and we were caught the guy at the top had to be able to handle the courts, he needed to be strong, eloquent, prepared and most of all he had to have the trust and loyalty of the people beneath him. As prepared as we are the whole thing is a house of cards if you can't rely on the people below you."

"And that's when you first starting holding elections?"

"Yes that's when it began, from there we got so caught up in campaigns and backroom deals, making promises and securing votes that we forget to commit any real crime. Eventually we realized we were making more money preparing for a crime than by ever actually committing one."

"How did you manage that?"

"We have a lot of skilled criminals and lawyers on the payroll, often as the same person. We have a lot of backup plans and contingencies for all sorts of heists, blackmail, kidnapping and any other crime you could think of. When I campaigned for president of our organisation I ran on a platform of committing crime legally. With the resources we had we became a security consulting company. Is your bank truly unbreakable, let us test it and find out. Want to know how long your family safe will hold up, give us a call. It's amazing how many things that we get paid to do that would normally be considered illegal"

"But that's not all you do, is it?"

"You're referring to the rumours that we also consult for the other side? That our position allows us a chance to sell other criminals the way past vaults, into rich homes and bypass security systems? Or that we hire other organisations to hit exploits in other companies so that they'll sign with us?"

"Uhh...No, I was referring to the kidnap experience and other thrill seeking adventures. What was that about consulting for the other side?"

I'd monologued too long, an old habit, hard to break really. The investigator was scribbling in his notepad rather quickly now. I would have to make sure he had an accident before he returned to his office. Vinny and Michael were currently conducting a security audit on his building they would be able to handle it.

"Do you have any comment on these rumours sir?" The investigator was sat, pen poised and ready to go. He was a liability and had to be dealt with. But not yet, the urge to monologue was strong. Just one more turn.

Score: 1203

When I turned 15, I was sent to the Sun Edge. I had grown up on the streets of Harka, learning no skill or trade. We couldn't afford the apprenticeship fees. My father had no lands to pass on to me, and all other good farms between there and the Star Edge had been claimed. So on Appraisal Day, there was nowhere else for me to go.

I was given a plot of land to work, only about two meters wide at the beginning. "It'll grow as the Edge advances," they said. The soldiers dropped me at the property line with a gaunt horse and some meager tools. They told me that I could have as much land as I could plow in the North-South direction by the time they returned to the Edge with another resettled orphan. At which point *he* would start plowing where I'd reached, and the cycle would begin all over again. 

I'm a city boy. I grew up amongst the trader's tents and the craftsmen's workshops. They'd hired me for every type of menial seasonal job: splitting wood, working bellows, carving out rotted parts of vegetables to make them look fresh... I even helped with the Migration once when the Star Edge got too close to the settlement. We'd loaded up carts with all of the shops and dragged them across the plains until we could see the Sun Edge, and then plopped it all down and set it up again. All of these jobs for a few coins, and the only one I'd never actually done was plow anything. Needless to say, I wasn't making very good headway. 

The metal plow fought me every step of the way, snagging on stubborn roots and buried rocks. And when I *could* find some clear ground, then the damned horse would decide that it didn't want to move! 

**CLUNK**. The plow ran into something again. But it wasn't the normal dull thud that the rocks made. It was a sharp clang, like the sound of a blacksmith's hammering on stout armor. Maybe another tool? Had some other poor settler been here before me and died with his plow in hand? I had been in the marketplace long enough to know that even salvaged instruments could fetch a hefty price, maybe even more than whatever pitiful crop I could scrape from the land. Mines were easy enough to dig, but could only last so long before the Star Edge would approach, and they had to be abandoned.

I dug it out. A long, thin tube made of pure metal, but rusted and caked in dirt. Skeletal hands clutched the grooved grip, and I soon uncovered the rest of the body. There were holes in the metal armor, and the skull had been caved in, but it didn't look like the wound from an ax or a hammer. Around the body, I found unusual metal pellets and a strange powder mixed into the soil. Where had it come from? What war had this man died in? I was only a meter away from the Sun Edge, and anything out there would be fried to a crisp after only a minute or two. No way that someone could have gone out long enough. And I'd never seen anything like this, so it certainly couldn't be from the last Rotation. Back then we had barely mastered metalworking!

From a distance, I heard a horse's whinny. The soldiers were returning with the next orphan to be resettled. I'd made barely any progress on the field; definitely not enough to support a family. I quickly covered up the body and the metal tube and went back to my work. The horse was finally willing to cooperate, and we managed to plow another hundred meters or so before the soldiers arrived with the next settler. I greeted them calmly, and they spit back in my face. Such chivalrous gentlemen. My new neighbor introduced himself: Gerome, another city boy like myself. "Watch for stones," I warned him, wishing him luck in his plowing. The soldiers laughed at our shared misfortune and headed back to the city for the next boy.

I watched them leave, then returned to that spot. There was something important about this device, and I didn't want the soldiers to know about it. I had to resolve this mystery for myself.

Hello "Robert,"

I have good news and bad news!

Good news: I don't think you're a scammer.

Bad news: I'm not falling for a pretty obvious prank. I'm not sure which of my idiot friends this is, but I'll figure it out :)

Next time, you might want to do a bit of research if you want a shot at fooling me. Nigeria doesn't *have* princes. Nigeria is a republic, not a monarchy.

Dear Katherine,

Thank you so much for responding. I was afraid you would just delete my note.

I understand that calling myself a "prince" is suspicious. But the political situation in Nigeria is more complicated than you have been led to believe. There are still several parts of the country with strong tribal allegiences. While "prince" may not be the most accurate title for what I am, it is the easiest to explain to westerners like yourself.

Please look me up on LinkedIn. That will show my background and clear up any confusion. I can only hope that you will believe me. My captors are beginning to lose their patience.

Hi Jim (yeah that's right–I figured out who you really are :) But I'll keep playing along),

I looked up Robert Iweala on LinkedIn. First of all, listing "Prince" as your job on LinkedIn doesn't prove that you're a prince. Second, I did a reverse image search on your profile pic and found where you actually got that photo from. It's just a random guy from a stock photography website.

Nice try :) Creating the LinkedIn profile was a nice touch.

Dear Katherine,

My apologies. I am not your friend Jim.

I can explain the stock photograph. After I graduated university I wanted to make a career for myself in Nollywood, the film scene here in Nigeria. I was never very successful, but I did do a few photoshoots for a stock photography company.

Today, my captors beat me within an inch of my life. I beg you to forward this message to my father.

Please, all I need you to do is forward my message to my father. There is no risk on your part. Even if you believe there is a 99% chance that this is some sort of sick joke, there's still a small chance I might be telling the truth, no?

I will tell you a tale my father once told me. Long ago, my grandfather was a judge in his village. A young man was accused of stealing. Though most thought him guilty, my grandfather let him go, for his guilt was not certain. When my father asked why, my grandfather said, "it is better that ten wicked men roam free than one righteous man suffer." I know you think me wicked; but ask yourself, what if I am that one righteous man?

My captors are no longer providing me with food or drink. This is the last message I will be able to send to you before I perish. I hope you find it in you to believe there may be a small chance of helping an innocent man out of a dangerous situation. My life is now in your hands.

#### [WP] One day you wake up and there are no numbers floating over peoples head because we finally stopped doing prompts about that

Score: 1202

I glanced in the mirror, surprised to find nothing there. Where was my number?

Grabbing my phone, I dialed the numbers with haste. Caesar answered after the third ring, much to my relief.

“Dude, it’s like six in the morning on a Saturday,” he said. “Why are you calling me so early?”

“Check your reflection in a mirror,” I barked. “Do you still see your number?”

“I don’t know. I’m in bed right now. I don’t really ca-”

“Just do it!”

Caesar sighed.

“Fine. Hold on.”

There was silence, the occasional sound of my friend rising and going towards his bathroom being picked up by the phone. I could have sworn I heard him mumbling curses at me. It didn’t matter; all I needed to hear was his confirmation.

“Huh,” Caesar started. “I guess it’s not there. Is that it?”

“Is that it?!” I had to take a deep breath to control my anger. “Don’t you see the problem? What are we going to do without numbers telling everything about our lives?”

“I don’t know. Just live your life, I guess.”

“But I can’t! Without the numbers, I have no idea how dangerous someone is. Like last week when they helped me avoid that murderer!”

“Well, in all fairness, he was calling you into a dark alleyway and had a bloody knife. Common sense should have told you he was bad news.”

“No way, man. And how am I supposed to go on with no knowledge of my worth. I mean, it’s stuff people love to write about. I could be Jesus for all we know!”

“Not when it’s regurgitated crap that they can see it a mile away,” Caesar said. “Look, I’m gonna go back to bed. You can have your meltdown but I would prefer to be left out. Have fun.”

“Wait! No, don’t –.”

The beep signaled the end of the conversation. I looked at my phone and, in a burst of anger, threw it against the wall. It shattered into a million pieces, like my life. I huddled in the corner in the fetal position, rocking myself back to sleep.

What am I going to do without my numbers?

#### [CW] You volunteered to test the first time machine, for the test you are sent 24 hours into the future. When you emerge from the machine you discover the lab trashed and empty with "Sorry" written on the wall in blood.

Score: 1202

The next giant leap for mankind. That's what they called it, that's what ran everytime it was discussed or debated. Time Travel. Into the past, impossible, but into our own futures? To see if tomorrow would be a better one, who could resist?

That thought drifted into my head as I emerged from the room, cage.... pod? Whatever it was that had taken me here. The first person to take a whooping 24 hour step through time. I looked around and what I saw was.... carnage. Blood covered the majority of the consoles and the crumpled bodies of the staff lay where they were cut down, grevious wounds and tears in the flesh responsible for their deaths. Then I saw it. Sorry.

It had been scrawled on the wall with blood, though no bodies lay near it. In face the whole area was spotless bar the message. Dwelling on it would get me nowhere, I needed to find out what happened here, and how to get out so it wouldn't happen to me. Most of the terminals were destroyed or smashed, except one. I couldn't find any door controls on it, but what I did find was the security footage from inside the lab. However it was what I saw that turned my blood to icy slush.

I saw myself get into the containter. I saw the procedure get under way. I saw the scientists open up the door, and the confusion on their faces when they saw my body was still there. It jerked and twitched to its feet like a badly controlled marionette. Then the killing started. It tore and stabbed and bit, wiping out the whole room in a manner of minutes. The blood from the dead and dying lab workers never seemed to touch it, whatever it was that had taken control on my body. 

It then dipped its hand in a pool of blood and walked over to the wall. It slowly wrote the message, taking care to properly form every letter as if a steady hand was something barely within its abilities. It then turned around, walked back into the container and the door sealed behind it.

I sped through the remaining 23 hours and 52 minutes, nothing of note happening, bar the occasional twitch from the bodies of some of the people that clung to life, though after a while that too passed. I arrived at 30 minutes ago, when I woke up, and stopped. The machine had either sent only my mind a day into the future, or put me in such a state in that I was no longer in control. And in that time, something else was.

After a momentary pause, I know that there is nothing I can do.  I think for a minute while the camera man is weeping and the director left the room.  I stare into the camera and regain my senses.
"OKAY KIDS!  It's time for a new game.  I want you to all run to the windows and close the drapes or blinds.  It's okay, I'll give you a few seconds.  We're not going anywhere!"  I think for a minute.

"Alright, now that you have the windows blocked, we're going to BE MONSTERS!  Put your hands in the air like this and make claws.  Stomp or hop or jump.  Open your mouth wide and roar."  

By this point the teleprompter is turned off.  Only a few workers are still here.  The camera man has opened a flask and began drinking.  "Now, you monsters, I want you all to know that I love each and every one of you.  No matter what happens, each monster is important and has made a difference in the world.  If your mom or dad or brother or sister are with you I want you to give them a big monster hug and hold onto them."

The camera man put his flask down long enough to hold up a sign stating New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Columbus are gone.

With tears in my eyes I tell my monsters, "It has been my honor meeting so many of my monsters.  You have all made my monster life so great!"  I can hardly breathe now.

Score: 1200

"No, dammit, don't charge, don't charge!" I cried out in my mind while my legs ran towards the dragon. 

I was clad in armor; from head to toe I was  covered with metals that most who passed me by only read from ancient tomes. My weapon was one that a legend himself once used and locked away. My belt consisted of tonics that even the greatest alchemist couldn't concoct. I was a god among men. 

Yet I charged against a dragon, a beast that breathed fire, with skin that had scaled that even the sharpest blade couldn't pierce. And I charged against it like an idiot. 

My life was constantly in jeopardy. I had fought this dragon for close to 2 hours. I died. I got back up. I charged again. I died, I got back up and I kept charging. It was because my body was controlled by a man-child of an imbecile mind. Perhaps God thought it humorous to give me a gift of immortality, inhuman resistance and the ability to stop time to rearrange my belt and armor at any time I see fit, and all these gifts came with a condition: that my body and will would be controlled by another. 

It wouldn't be such a bad thing. We would work together and rule this realm as god kings. But what does this imbecile that controls me like one would a puppet, what does he do? 

He collects flowers. And butterflies. And bloody rocks. I am a rock collector. I am a rock collecting GOD that slays dragons whence this manchild feels twenty days worth of collecting flowers and rocks is enough and now it is time to hunt. 

People laugh at me, because there was a dragon in the midst, and my manchild of a pupeteer decided this location would be a great time for the Great Flower Harvest and when this dragon, this majestic beast took aim at me, what do I do? Do I perhaps retreat and trick the dragon with a  flank attack and slice off its wings with this legendary sword that I possess? Or do I poison it with one of the thousand poisons I carry in my arsenal, or should I perhaps tame it and even ride it into battle against my other foes. 

No, says my putrid brain puppeteer. I'll fucking charge at it.

#### [WP] Snape is forced to teach sex-ed at Hogwarts.

Score: 1197

"There have been some recent *incidents*," Snape said with an icy whisper and a pointed stare at Lavender "that have caused the Board of Governors to *re-evaluate* the school's curriculum. So instead of Potions, today I will be instructing you on the matters of reproduction." He grimaced like he had something foul caught in his nostrils. He tapped his wand against the side of the desk, and posters popped out of nowhere with detailed diagrams of genitalia. "BLIMEY!" Ron blurted out, gripping the front of the desk as his eyes went wide. A wave of giggles rolled through the classroom; Snape rolled his eyes. 

"Try to control yourself and pay attention, Mr. Weasley. It may be a while before you have another opportunity to study some," he remarked with his trademark sneer as he gestured at the diagram of breasts. Ron turned bright red and shrank down in his desk while Malfoy struggled to contain his laughter. 

"We will begin with a lesson concerning the genitalia." He rapped his wand against a detailed cross-section of the penis. "Can anyone name the parts of the male anatomy depicted here?" he asked the class. The room was so silent you could have heard a pixie's whisper. "Oh, no answers to volunteer for once, Ms. Granger?" His mouth twisted into the closest thing he had to a smile, but still cruel and heartless. Hermione bit her lip; she looked like she was about to cry. He was taking an inordinate amount of pleasure in humiliating the Gryffindors today. "Very well," he continued. "Get out your quills."

After a long lecture on anatomy that resulted in quite a few uncomfortable pauses and hurried glances between members of the opposite sex, the topic turned to the subject of sexually transmitted diseases. "There are a number of afflictions that you all should watch out for. These can be naturally occurring, such as Dragon's Breath which gives an uncomfortable rash, as well as the hex-based ailments that can be inflicted by a jilted lover, including Cupid's Curse and Cauldron Rot." 

"Probably a common affliction for Potions Masters," Ron whispered. Harry couldn't help but snort, and Snape was looming suddenly over them like a bat. "Fifty. Points. From. Gryffindor," he said slowly, seething with anger and grinding his teeth between each pause. Ron had evidently struck a bit too close to home. 

"Worse than the diseases, though," he continued "Are the attempted cures. I've seen many a foolish student" he glanced at Neville and raised his thin black eyebrows, "think that they could simply charm away a bad case of Dungeon Boils, only to find themselves in the hospital wing having Madam Pomfrey apply some particularly unpleasant creams, to some *particularly* sensitive areas." Neville looked positively sick at the thought.

From there, the lecture turned to pregnancy. "Prevention is most important," Snape said emphatically. "Though legal, there are certain sects of the Wizard community who find it... distasteful, shall we say, to not carry to term. The ladies of the room can prevent pregnancy with a simple potion, which I shall pass out instructions for all of you to brew. But for the boys in the room..." He produced a small paper packet from his pocket. "These are known as 'condoms.'" He tore it open, and a bright purple patch of rubber danced out of the package and hopped onto the table, slowly inflating. Snape looked at it with disdain as it swirled around in a circle, and lunged at Snape's crotch. "It will simply apply itself," he said as he caught it deftly, and it deflated like a worm in his hand. "But be forewarned: if it has turned black, it has expired."

"Snape's probably used to them matching the rest of his wardrobe," Ron whispered again. Hermione had to use a Silencio charm on Harry to prevent him from bursting out in laughter. 

Finally, the bell rang and they fled the dungeon classroom as though chased by dragons. "I've got to... er... go to my locker!" Hermione said to her shoes, afraid to look either of the boys in the face. Ron blushed as she ran down the hallway. Padma and Parvati passed by and both gave Harry a slight wave. "Well done, boy," said a knight in a painting in the hall behind him. "Well done indeed!"

Score: 1193

I didn't spend much time on my wedding vows.  I didn't intend to keep many of them, anyway.  My first vow was to always be honest with her.  I broke that vow at the reception when she asked me how her hair looked.  My wife still believes in pure, innocent love, so I do the song and dance.  I bullshitted a few more vows for her benefit.  Must've done a good job, since she was almost too emotional to say the words "I do."

I watch my brother give a toast.  He's red-faced and needs one hand on the table to stop from falling down, but everybody is eating this crap right up.  He's slurring a made-up story about how he knew my wife and I were meant for each other from day one.  Even though he's too drunk to pronounce my wife's name, half the audience is in tears.

Not everything I said was bullshit.  At the end of my vows, I looked deep into my wife's eyes, and I said, "I would do anything for you."

That was true.  I would do anything for my wife.  And I have.

If she knew about Brenna, it would kill her.  It would cost me my job, too.  I've been teaching at that high school for fifteen years, and that one mistake would've taken everything from me.

So I went to Brenna's house.  I knew I could shame her into aborting it.  Her parents had abandoned her years ago.  Giving up on children was in her genes.  It was tougher than I thought, though.  I didn't want to call a seventeen-year-old girl a whore.  But I did it for love.  She should be going to the clinic any day, now.  Might even be today.

Brenna lived with her grandparents.  I came to her house when neither of them were home.  On my way out, I encountered her grandmother.  That complicated things.  She knew.  She threatened to expose what had happened.  I'm almost positive she hit me first, but it's tough to remember.  I didn't mean to kick her once she was on the ground.  Not that any of that matters.  I did it for love.

Brenna, God love her, agreed to stay quiet.  She would say a burglar came into the house and attacked her grandmother.  Last I heard, the old woman was in a coma.  Her husband intended to take her off life support any day, now.  Might even be today.

As I watch my brother give a speech, I see my nephew in the back of the reception hall.  He steals a kiss from the flower girl.  She turns red.  It might be her first.  Maybe someday she'll learn that there's no such thing as pure and innocent love.

Might even be today.

#### [WP] You and your spouse are fairly typical demonic overlords with a figurative/literal dark fortress, minions to command etc. The problem is your teenage child who's going through that rebellious phase; claiming that they're good, dressing in all whites and only listening to gentle hymns.

Score: 1192

Rotten Agiel,

I'm writing this so that you might read it and consider the words carefully; you and I both know that the written word has more power than the spoken one more often than not. Your father and I are summoned, from time to time, by written word more frequently than chanting these days. So, although you're mad at us, and me in particular, I hope you will read this with deep consideration.

I'm sorry that I burned your white robes. It was childish of me, and I knew it wouldn't be hard for you to get more once you saw what I had done. I was just frustrated with your behavior. We all go through rebellious phases, and you know your father and I will always love you no matter what kind of demon you grow up to be- but that's the thing, you cannot reject your demonic powers. You were born from my womb. You are an evil, divine being, and nothing can change that. But let me explain why it's so important that you accept this part of yourself.

For centuries, since Christ walked the earth, we have been seen as the less desirable counterpart to heaven and God. Truly, we are gods, we have the same powers and influence. Lucifer means "bringer of light", and since the dawn of time, that has been our role in this universe. To bring knowledge, and understanding, to all creatures. God's role is to bring order, laws, morals, ours is to bring chaos, greed, and sense. Both are needed. Humans cannot survive as a slave to that heavenly body, just as they cannot survive without order. They need balance. That is what you and I and all of us here in Hell are meant to do. I understand your compassion for humans. It is that compassion that first inspired the serpent to guide Eve to the tree of knowledge. It is that compassion that compels demons, strong and weak, known and unknown, to respond to summonings every day.

So when you reject demonology, when you claim you want to win God's favor and become an angel, it breaks my heart. You are, and will always be, a demon. We are disgusting, hedonistic creatures. We are evil incarnate, and that is not a bad thing. These days, we suffer from so much hatred from every angle, and I don't blame you for internalizing some of it. I just want to help you love your roots, your species, yourself. If you want, your father can talk to you about contracts with humans, and how to possess a human's body. Or I can teach you all about our history, and how to respond to various calls from ouija boards or satanic circles. There's so many resources out there, and if you want to truly help humans, do what you're good at. Do what we were meant to do all along; inspire those humans to work for themselves. Give them confidence, give them curiosity and selfish love, give them ambition. 

Finally, the reason we disapprove of this behavior is because we know you're never going to be an angel. I don't say this to be hurtful. I'm saying it because it's true. You've read the old testament, you know God is vengeful and holds grudges. Since Lucifer fell from grace, God has been waging a smear campaign on our kind. He's been pretty successful, and the only way you could possibly change his mind now is if you completely abandoned your morals. God is concerned with laws, with rules, with rituals and a higher state of consciousness. Anyone that doesn't meet his requirements by the time they die is sent down to our realm, as if that is some sort of punishment. Here in Hell, you have the freedom to be your own person. You can love or hate, you can learn or remain ignorant, you can work for humans or against them. It is all up to you. 

The only thing I ask, the only rule I have, is for your own good. When you come of age and you're 666 years old, you can decide for yourself. Until then, please, embrace the fact that we are demons. Beautiful, terrifying, bringers of light. 

Vehemently, 
Saleos

#### [WP] A thief steals a car only to find a dead body stashed in the trunk with a note that says "Tag, you're it."

Score: 1189

"Yes," I told him. "$10,000 to steal that car for me." I'd sent him a photo of the vehicle earlier and told him where to find it.

Sam's gravely voice on the other end was skeptical. "That car ain't even worth 10k." I think his name was Sam, at least. It's hard to keep them all straight.

"Not your concern," I told him. "I just want the car, and I want it delivered to 1821 North Allen Rd. And I don't want any evidence in the car. You make sure you have gloves on."

"Your money, man," he said. Sam wasn't stupid. He'd know that it wasn't about the car; it was about the contents. Nobody cared about some rusty Honda Accord abandoned in an old parking lot that seemed like it had been there for weeks. This was a delivery job, not a boost job. Probably drugs, or drug money. Those are both common in this neighborhood. I was *counting* on Sam to put two and two together, and also to get a little greedy. 

I took up my position in the abandoned office building across the street, pulling down the massive "For Lease" sign to get a better view. It was faded after at least a year of sun exposure in the window; no one wanted to rent this dump. I had my night-vision binoculars and a folding lawn chair for a front-row seat of the action.

A car pulled up at 12:31 AM, very conspicuous in this utterly deserted part of town. A bit late, given that I'd told him to have it at the dropoff by 1. Not that I really cared whether he was late. He would never make it in the first place. I took out my phone.

"9-1-1, what's your emergency?"

"He...hello? Please, you need to send someone immediately! I just heard screaming! Horrible screaming, like a girl dying! I think it's a carjacking!"

Across the street, my associate had reached the car he was supposed to steal. He circled it, peering into windows with a flashlight. My heart skipped a beat when he looked into the passenger side, but he moved on without a second glance.

"Calm down, Sir. What's your location?"

"The corner of Medton Street and 21st Avenue! Please, send someone immediately."

"Just stay calm. Officers are on the...." I hung up.

Sam looked around, checking for any potential witnesses. He looked straight at the building across the street, where I was lurking three stories up. But he had absolutely no idea I was watching, thankfully. He went to the driver's side door of the car and tugged at the door. Locked, of course. Don't want to make things too easy on him, do we? He hunched over it, blocking my view, and managed to get the door open in under a minute. Pretty impressive! I was worried he might resort to breaking the glass, but he was a pro. I knew I'd picked the right man for the job; he had a long rap-sheet of break-ins. 

The key was already in the ignition. This was definitely a surprise for him. I watched him hold it up and study it closely in the dim light from the street lamps, as if trying to determine if this *really was* the key to this particular car. Of course it was!

In the distance, I could hear approaching sirens. Could Sam hear them? Would he even care? It's not an uncommon sound in these parts. And he had no reason to think they were coming for him.

Sam circled around to the trunk, and I got jittery with anticipation. This was the fun part. I could clearly see his broad smile as he prepared to assess the loot, and maybe skim a bit off the top. Who would notice a kilo or two of drugs, or one more stack of bills missing from an entire trunkload? 

He popped it open. I could almost hear the rusty whine of the hinges. I opened Snapchat on my phone and typed out the message. His flashlight clicked on, and he looked down. I hit "send," and saw the phone in the trunk light up. Then Sam backed away from the car. 

He was looking at the body of one Amanda Martin, stabbed multiple times earlier this evening. Precisely calculated wounds to ensure that she was still alive when she went into that trunk. Wounds that would keep bleeding for over an hour, until she expired right around 12:31. If she was a fighter, she could still be clinging to life! I'd planned for that, of course: any attempt to remove her from the trunk would slide a blade right down her wrist, finishing the job once and for all. The message on the phone only read "Tag, you're it." One last taunt that would disappear in just a few seconds.

Right on time, the police swung around the corner, lights flashing and sirens blaring. Three cars roared over the curb and came to a screeching halt to surround Sam and the car. I saw him drop to his knees as officers rushed from their cars, caught sight of the body, and unholstered their weapons. A closer inspection of the car would reveal a bloody knife and a half-written ransom note. Probably enough to convict Sam, given that he'd be saddled with some overworked public defender who'd immediately write him off as a lost cause.

I quietly packed up my belongings as more police arrived and made my way to the parking lot of the office building. I climbed into my own car and slowly pulled onto the street. I was far enough from the crime scene now to escape unnoticed, but more police attention might soon make that difficult. 

It's a shame, too. Sam had seemed like a nice enough kid. Better than the other patsies I'd used. But bodies had to be disposed of, and the best way to do that is to ensure that no one was even looking for them.

"Don't play the fresh fry with me," he said, his needle-like teeth showing, "I know what you're *really* here for."  
She blushed like a slapped baboon's arse that had been slapped.  
"Mister Grayling I don't -"   
His scaled head reared over the driftwood desk and he fixed her with one eye, then the other.  
"Shhhh," he whispered, like air escaping from a well-used blow-up doll, "this interview is over Miss Seal. I've seen enough. The reception sharks will see you out."   
Embarrassed beyond belief, she wriggled out the door of the office.  

&nbsp;  
Suddenly he was there, in Agnathia's hardware shop.  
"Miss Seal," he said, inclining his shiny face towards her like a kettle or something.  
She bit her lip in consternation and he shivered,  
"Don't do that Miss Seal, you know what it does to me."   
"No I don -"  
"Shhh," he chastened her again, "I'll have some coloured feathers, a hundred meters of nylon, some *hooks* and a bucket of squid bits."  
"You're the -"  
"Yes, I'm quite the complete serial killer whale."  
Agnathia's co-worker Collin Carp, swam out from behind the shelvefishes,  
"Is this guy bothering you Agna?"  
"As a matter -"  
Fishtian swirled to the counter imperiously, like a king who was the ruler of a country that he'd inherited from his father, who was also a king.  
"I'll take these and leave."  
And then he did.

&nbsp;  
Agnathia didn't know why she'd gone to his coral condo, but she was here now.  
"I want to show you my *play room*" he said, pushing her down the opulent corridor like she was a shopping trolley full of frozen burritos and he was a basement dwelling redditor.  
"What's in -"  
"Shhhh," he crooned, like a thing that croons. Maybe a 50's crooner.  
He placed his fin on the doorknob,  
"I don't normally show girls my play room on the first date,"  
Without waiting for her to give any indication, he flung the door open.  
Agnathia gasped, without being interrupted.  
The room was hung with driftnets and filled with rods and reels of all makes and models. Hooks hung in rows from the ceiling and buckets of bait sat stinking in all the corners.  
Screaming, Agnathia ran from the room in terror,  
"You're a *fisherman!*" she wailed, like a... whale?  
Fishtian stalked to the window of the condo and placed his fins on the convenient desk.  
"I know," he said, then;  
*"I'm fishty shades of fucked up"*

#### [WP] Everyone dies twice: once when their body dies, and once when their name is spoken for the last time. One must wander the earth as a ghost until their name is spoken for the last time; only then can they pass into the afterlife. It's been over 3000 years, and you're still here.

Score: 1184

The sad thing is, by the time most people die they don't want to live any more. Look into the eyes of an old man and you will see one overriding desire. Wander around the average old-age care home and you can feel it heavy in the air. That last gasp really is a gasp of relief. That peaceful look which finally settles over their face is no lie.

I should know, when you've lived as long as I have you've seen a lot of people die. 3000 years, that's 38 lifetimes. 120 generations. If I had any living decedents they would likely be my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren. That's crazy, huh?

Of course, it's a strange sort of existence, mine. Nobody actually living can see me. I can't interact with the world in any way. I've never seen any other ghost, like me. Although I presume they must exist. I died when I was 83, lung cancer. I can't remember what it's like to taste anything, what it's like to dream, or to remember. Or to cry. The human mind is not meant to function for this long. What am I? Where did I come from? Why am I here? The same eternal questions trouble me now, after 3000 years, just as much as they do the short-lived mortals who somehow still inhabit this planet.

I'm stuck here in limbo, and I don't know how to leave. How does a ghost kill themselves? I want to die so bad. You can't imagine how much I want to stop thinking. 3000 years, with no human interaction. 12,000 seasons without ever feeling the warmth of the sun on your skin. 36,000 months without ever experiencing that invigorating breath of fresh crisp winter air. 156,000 weeks without anything to live for. Over one Million days. What does a man who isn't really alive do for a million days?

Have you ever been asked the question "Do you want to live forever?" When I was alive, I was obsessed with living forever. I would emphatically answer YES to this question every time. When I died and found myself still here I was excited. I felt like my wish had been granted. Perhaps it was. I roamed the world. I was all-knowing, there was nowhere I couldn't go. I floated through walls, across oceans, into war-zones and the most secret meetings. And then I got bored. Humanity is boring. Apes, they blow things up, then they build them again, then they blow them up again. This is torture. Occasionally there will be somebody or something special but they, or it, are here and gone so quickly it seems so pointless. 

My favourite past-time these days is to sit and read. I can't turn the pages, of course. So I  find somebody who reads at about the same speed as me. They turn the pages, we read together. If you ever find yourself in this situation, make sure the reader you choose to haunt reads slightly slower than you. It is so frustrating to miss the last sentence of every other page. But what do I do when they sleep. When they eat. When they shit. Or when they just sit there staring into nothingness while I'm dying to know what is on the next page. Not literally dying.

#### [WP] A duel between two Wizards. Except they are not Archmages but apprentices who can barely cast spells.

Score: 1184

Torches hung high on the stone walls, like flickering guardians watching over the hall. At the center of the hall stood a young girl, with a gnarled staff gripped in both hands. The staff was easily twice her height, and she had to move it by dragging it across the cobbled floor.

A dozen paces in front of her stood a boy dressed in a robe. Or rather, a robe stood with a boy in it. The hem of the robe, which glowed in the darkness, piled around the boy's feet, and the sleeves swallowed his arms. On his head, he wore a hat with a brim so wide, he had to hold it up to see. Sewn-on moons and stars shimmered and rolled slowly around the brim of the hat. 

Two men, hidden by the shadows, looked on as the children struggled to face each other.

"No interference?" one said, with a voice as gentle as a bubbling cauldron.

"No interference," said the other, who could have been half-giant by the way his voice rumbled. 

"What makes the victor?"

"Whoever is knocked from their feet is the victim."

The first voice chuckled, "But yours can barely stand."

"And yours can barely see."

"Fair enough. Shall we commence?"

The second man nodded at the first, and the first raised his arms, calling out to the children, "Listen! Knock your opponent down, and you will claim all honor! Beg-"

"Daddy, I have to go to the toilet!" cried the girl.

The second man grumbled, and tried to lend his voice a note of encouragement, "You can go in a minute, sweetie. First, you have to win the duel."

"Okay, daddy."

The first man cleared his throat, and in a voice that echoed over the stones, he boomed out, "Begin the duel!"

The two children shuffled around to look at each other. The girl waved at the boy, and shouted, 
"Are you ready?" 

The boy tried to wave back, but his hands didn't reach beyond the sleeves of his robes. As his head bobbed up an down, His hat flapped and sank over his eyes, which made the girl burst into giggles.

The first man stepped forward, and the second stopped him by saying, "No interference, remember?"

"Okay," the girl announced, "I'm going to cast a *icey* spell!"

"Okay," came the muffled reply of the boy, who seemed to have sunk even further into his robes, "And I'm going to cast - I'm going to cast a *flying* spell!"

The two men looked at each other, "You taught him a levitation spell?"

"Uhhh... no. I did not."

"Then what is he talking about?"

A shrug was the only reply.

The girl maneuvered the staff until it was resting on her back and over her shoulder, and angled vaguely towards the boy. 

"*Arctus Immensio!*" the girl squeaked.

A drop of ice squeezed out of the tip of the staff, and dropped on the back of her neck. She screamed.

"*Uppity huppity*" the boy shouted, bouncing up and down inside of the robes. He looked like nothing more than a pile of clothes, dangling on a wire, "Up, up and away! Fly-us up-us!"

More ice squeezed out of the tip of the staff, clattering around the girl, and piling up around her feet. She shrieked, "Stop! Cancel! Stop it!" and she threw the staff down, which only seemed to increase the volume of ice leaking out of the staff's end. She hopped around the cobbles, scrabbling with the collar of her robe to pull out the ice.

The men looked at the boy, who was actually floating a few inches off the ground. Or rather, his robes were floating off the ground with the boy still tangled up in them. It was as if a softly glowing ghost had swallowed a child whole, and the child was fighting back from inside the ghost's stomach.

"Daddy!" the girl shrieked, "Daddy, I can't make it stop!"

Icicles had formed on the floor, stalagmites that pointed up towards the ceiling. More ice vomited from the spear-tips of the icicles, threatening to paint the whole room in slick, frozen water. 

The two men looked at each other. The first man's face was red, while the other was struggling to contain his laughter.

"Think we *should* interfere, yet?"

"Maybe just a little."

#### [WP] Marriage vows are now a legal contract. The line "until death do you part" now has to be taken literally. As a result, divorcing couples must now fight to the death.

Score: 1182

This was his 9th Marriage. 

He had been training for marriage since he was but a wee babe. No school for him and his ilk, just combat training from Dusk 'til Dawn. First marriage at 18, lucky to make it out of that one alive. He could hear the low rumble of spectators through the walls. 

Vows were in 20 minutes meaning he'll have to the paparazzi in 10. Probably have to get some photos taken with some celebrities. He'll hold his sword as if to strike like he always does. His hands always got clammy on wedding days. 

This particular Prenuptial agreement was sponsored by Korematsu Industries, Parker Athletics, and Mama Jackson's Sweet Honey Restaurant Chain. Big money. 
If he makes it out of this one, that'll be close $2 billion syphoning into his bank accounts and the bank accounts of his promoters and trainers.

It's funny that in an attempt to maintain the sanctity of marriage the Government had instead created the loophole that made this form of entertainment legal. Gay marriage was legal, murder was not. Those brave enough were signing up across the country to try their hand at fighting to the death.

It promised Fame.
It promised Fortune.
It promised Respect.
It promised POWER.

are you brave enough to enter...
the WEDDING RING.

#### [WP] When turning 21, everyone develops a mutation, either physical (Claws, horns, wings) or mental (telekinesis, extreme intelligence, etc). You've just turned 21, and you're terrified of what you've gained (though others will be impressed).

Your whole life story, I could read with a look

That's my mutation, but there's a big hook.

I was in love at the time, you see

And she always said, "you're the only one for me."

But I quickly discovered it was nothing but lies,

She was saying the same thing to two other guys.

You got lucky with your gift, the others would say.

As for me, I just try to get through my day.

It's rough seeing into their past dirty laundry,

Though I never let on, it's still quite a quandary

I don't want to see teenage you cheating on a test,

Or your deadbeat father leaving the nest

I've seen horrible things you've likely repressed,

once again, this "blessing" isn't the best.

It's been so bad that when I see certain things,

My outlook gets dark; it's the feeling it brings.

I looked in my dad's eyes the other day.

I was so mortified, I didn't know what to say.

I was done with this "gift," I said to myself,

As I reached for the pistol high on the top shelf.


The barrel felt cool as it touched my forehead

I tried to find words, but nothing needed be said.

Maybe in the next life, my vision would be clearer.

That's when I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror.

I locked eyes with myself for the first time in a while,

And saw a truth in my life story that was perfectly vile:

No matter how much I wished to end my life in this rage...

I was destined to die an old man, of old age.

"Open the door now!"

The second wave of bangs was hard enough that dust flew off the hinges of the door. Gary didn't move.

Not that he particularly wanted to, but it would take about twenty minutes to get from his chair to the door, 
anyway.

"Mr. Turner, we are bringing the door down!"

Gary sighed, changing the channels on the TV. His eyes stopped on his own face on channel five. The interview 
from the previous week.

*"-- you are being referred to as Gary, the Planet Swallower. Other people have called you Turner, the Destroyer of 
Galaxies. Do you have anything to say about these 'nicknames'?"*

"All right, stand back boys. Bring it down!"

*"Well, I don't know what my power is, Roger, so I'm not sure I can do either of these things. But I do think Planet 
Swallower is a pretty dope name."*

*BAM*

Gary looked from the TV to the door. So that was it. That was how it ended.

Not a bad way to go, if you think about it. Especially after a hundred years.

*BAM*

One of the hinges flew off, and the door cracked open a bit, enough that Gary could spot a group of uniformed men 
standing outside, guns in hand.

"Mr. Turner!"

The voice came from the other side, and Gary turned to find a face hidden behind a black wool mask, eyeing him 
from out his window.

"Who the fuck are you?" Gary asked, as another blow brought his door closer to turning into an archway. "I'm kind of in the middle of something here."

"This way, Mr. Turner!" 

The man stepped through the window into Gary's living room. He grabbed his hand.

Gary got up, straightening his back with all the hush of a man not about to be captured by the government. "What do you want? I don't --"

*BAM*

The door came down, and the SWAT Team rushed in.

"Don't move!" cried the man in front, aiming and pointing.

The wool mask man put a strong arm around Gary and, in a skilled and elegant movement, threw him violently 
through his own window and followed.

"I'm a hundred years old, kid!" Gary exclaimed, from the muddy floor out by his garden. "Could you not –"

"Get it the car!" the man demanded, grabbing Gary again and again throwing him.

Gary landed (more or less) in the passenger seat of a black sedan parked by the side of his house. Just as the 
SWAT men reached the window, wool-masked dude hit the gas and the car sped off down the highway.



__________



"You have no idea what we are risking to keep you safe, Mr. Turner," the wool mask said, as they distanced 
themselves from Gary's house and entered the freeway.

"We?" Gary asked, in a bored tone, watching the sunset hide behind the hills outside.

"Yes, we. I work for PowerFree, have you heard of us?"

"No."

The man sighed. "We are a non-government organization tasked with protecting those with sensitive powers. We 
keep people whose powers present a threat to themselves safe. Powers that third parties might see as an opportunity. Powers people have interest in taking advantage of. We fight against companies who try to exploit people in these kind of special situations. We protect people like you against secret operations like the one that was about to go down at your house. We serve the people by –"

"I was lying,' Gary mumbled, still watching the landscape outside. "I saw the documentary on you guys. It was on 
Netflix."

The wool masked man threw a look Gary's way, frowning.

"You think we can stop for ice cream?" Gary asked, as they rushed past a Baskin and Robbins.

"Mr. Turner, the whole world is after you. That interview you did… I know of at least three government top secret 
projects to get a hold of you, and companies, and foreign governments… My God… Even the KGB has a file on you, I --"

"I could go for some burgers too," Gary whispered, waving his hand carelessly. A paperclip resting on top of the 
glove compartment lifted from the dashboard and hovered in the air for a couple of seconds, before falling back 
down softly against the plastic.

"This is no time to think about food!" The wool man yelled. "Do you have any idea the danger you are in? The danger I am in now that I've rescued you? Do you have any ide – did you do that?"

"Oh, yeah," Gary replied, smiling. "It's my superpower. Got it when I was three. I can levitate objects, but only five 
inches from the ground and only if they are lighten than a pound. Also only for a couple of seconds. Also only if they're shaped like a paper clip or a coin or an Okapi."

The car drifted out into the car pool lane, almost crashing against a Prius before the wool man managed to take 
control of the wheel again. "*What!?*"

"Okapi. It's a kind of zebra." Gary smiled, grabbing a quarter from his pocket and hovering it above the palm of his hand. "Could never find one that weighted less than a pound, though."

"Wh-what… how… why…" the wool man seemed to be having a hard time coming up with words. Gary wondered if this was his power. "Why on *Earth* did you tell everyone you didn't have a power yet? On national TV!?"

Gary grabbed the quarter again and hovered it over his palm a second time. It danced slowly in the air for a bit, 
then collided back to his skin.

"I don't know. I was bored," he said, tossing the coin out the window. "Seriously… burgers?"

#### [WP] A 80's sitcom starring two former SS soldiers trying to fit in to American life called "Everything's all Reich"

Score: 1179

<a cheesy sitcom rendition of The Flight of the Valkyries plays>

 'Everything's Going to be All Reich is filmed in front of a live studio audience.'


{The role of Hans will be played by Bob Saget, the role Ernst will be played by Ted Danson, and tonight's  guest star is Scott Baio, as their Italian neighbor.}

Open on an average sized apartment. There is a large German flag hanging on the wall. The kitchen has several large Beer Steins.

Suddenly, the front door opens to Hans and Ernst bickering.

<audience applauds>

(Hans)
"I'm just saying, you shouldn't ask every person who's eating a bagel if they're A Jew."

(Ernst)
"I'm just trying to find the enemy."

(Hans)
"Well based on this economy, I think his name is Jimmy Carter."

<audience laughs>

(Ernst)
"Hans I feel like ever since we left the Fatherland, you've changed a lot.
When's the last time you beat a minority?"

(Hans)
"Does getting my citizenship count?"

<audience laughs>

(Ernst wags his head)
"Oh Hans, you crazy son of a Nazi! What am I going to do with you?"

(Hans)
"Well we could go hunting for some women..."

(Ernst)
"As long as you promise not to bore them with anymore war stories!"

(Hans)
"It's not my fault Americans don't have attention spans!"

(Ernst) 
"For once I agree. Women in this country can't concentrate on anything."

(Hans)
"ERNST! I've got it! We should open up a concentration camp for all the women! We'll be rich!"

<audience bursts out in laughter>

(Ernst)
"Oh Jew...."

Hans suddenly lifts his left pant leg, revealing a Luger pistol. 

(Hans)
"Where?!?!?

(Ernst, with a smile sighs and shakes his head whilst looking at the camera)

<audience laughs>

In the background, crashing is heard coming from outside the house. 

(Hans)
"What is that crazy guido Alfonso doing?"

The camera looks out the window to find Alfonso wearing a white wife beater, wildly gesticulating to a mover, unloading a truck. There is a box that is laying broken, open on the ground. 
Alfonso turns and looks to the camera, and sees Hans and Ernst.

He smiles and waves, and seconds later, enters the house.

<audience applauses>

(Alfonso)
"Hey, how's youse guys doing?"

(Ernst)
"We are fine. How are you Alfonso?"

(Alfonso)
"Ey, o, my papa was Alfonso. Call me Al."

(Hans)
"Well, Al, what are you having moved in?"

(Al)
"A meat slicer and some other stuff from back home. These American movers are terrible though, I've had like five things broken already."

Like clockwork, the mover drops another box.

<audience laughs>

(Al)
"AYYY!!! BE NEAT O!!"

(Ernst, Al, and Hans all laugh)

(Al)
"Yo, I was thinking, what if us Europeans formed some sort of Alliance?"

(Ernst, looking intrigued)
"An Axis of European powers? Sounds like something not even America could keep down."

<audience laughs>

(Hans)
"We will join, as long as the Russians: Ivan and Fyodor cannot join."

(Al)
"Those commie bastards have their own alliance, with the dirty Arabs next door."

<audience laughs>

(Al)
"Alright Germans, I'll be back next week with my famous Mussel Linguini, to eat in celebration of our newly formed European Alliance. We'll eat some Mussolini to celebrate the Axis!"

<audience applauds and laughs>

Credits roll, 99 Luftballons plays



OP here:
This is now a subreddit!  R/EverythingsAllReich is now open! Thanks again everyone for upvoting this!
Hope to see readers there for weekly tales of Hans and Ernst

#### [WP] There is a time traveler who visits every historical figure twice: on their 10th birthday and their deathbed. On the first visit, they will be told all the will accomplish in life. The second visit will tell how their legacy is remembered.

Score: 1178

"You?" I managed to croak, grasping at the handrails of my hospital bed and trying to sit up. The heart monitor began to beep faster, and lights flashed. 

The man in the bright orange jumpsuit took a step closer and bowed in greeting. The neon fabric contrasted with his dark skin. "Hello, Ms. Sanchez. Or, should I say *Madame President*? It's been a long time for you, hasn't it?" In his hand, he held a blue elephant stuffed animal that I'd had as a kid. That he'd taken from my room that night. He handed me the toy with a smile.

"For so long, I thought you were imaginary. A dream," I whispered, holding the elephant in my hands. It seemed brand new, though it had disappeared a century ago. "I tried to convince myself you weren't real..." Perhaps he still wasn't. Maybe this was a side effect of that new medication the doctor had tried. He'd said that it was experimental and still somewhat unknown.

The man took a seat in one of the chairs near my bedside that had been occupied by my family members only a few hours prior, and placed a warm hand on my arm. "I'm most certainly real." His tone was both polite and indignant. 

"Who are you?" 

He smiled. "I do owe you an explanation now. My official title is 'Harbinger.' I come from a distant future, using this." He held up a small square of metal, no larger than a cell phone. "It is my duty to come back and give certain historical figures a nudge in the right direction. I spoke with you just a minute ago, when you were only ten years old." 

"You told me I would be President," I said, replaying the memory in my head. Even now, when I struggled to remember my son's face from earlier today, I could still clearly picture this Harbinger wearing the same orange jumpsuit and appearing in my bedroom over a century ago. How he'd told me about my destiny, and everything that I could do to achieve it. And how the world would be so much better. Then he'd simply opened a door in thin air and stepped through, disappearing forever with my blue elephant. "You were wrong though," I told him with a smirk.

"Oh?" He gestured toward the door marked with the Presidential seal, where my secret service detail was waiting in the hallway. It had been decades since I was in office, but a President is protected for life. 

"You told me I'd fix everything. How I'd be the greatest President of the modern age, and solve all of these complicated world problems, and do all of these things. But I couldn't. The world is still falling apart at the seams."

He gave a wry smile. "You're right. I did lie to you. About everything."

We both fell silent as I processed this, interrupted only by the beeping of the machines keeping me alive. "That can't be." I finally answered. "I did everything exactly as you said. Going to Harvard... Running for governor... then Secretary of Defense.. just like you told me."

He smiled. "Maybe you only followed that path because you were *told* that it was your destiny. Did I tell you your fate, or did I write it for you?"

"This whole time..." I whispered. *Not possible,* I told myself.

"The Harbinger program identified you as someone with significant potential," he said. "Intelligent, charismatic, compassionate, but... listless in another timeline. All we had to do was give you hint at what you *could* achieve, and you did the rest yourself. Why else would we need to come back and interfere, instead of letting history run its course?" 

Memories flashed through my mind, of me accepting Harvard because I knew I was supposed to. Deciding to run for Governor against a popular incumbent because I *knew* I would win. Asking to be Secretary of Defense instead of Vice President because that was my destiny... "Why, though?"

"The world is better now because you *tried* to fulfill this prophecy, isn't it?" he gestured around the room at the shelves and shelves of flowers and gifts from well wishers. "You were motivated to *try* because I told you that you *would* fix all of those problems. But think about all the good you did, even if you couldn't solve *everything*."

I gave a weak smile. I *had* done a lot, hadn't I? "Is that why you came back?" I asked. 

"Yes." He was beaming like a proud parent. "I've come back to thank you. You saved millions of people from death in one way or another. And you improved the lives of countless others in so many ways."

"And what now?" I asked.

"Now, we die."

I sighed. I'd known that that was coming for a while. "You too? You don't go back?"

"The timeline seems to shift upon death. I will be erased, but there will be some new version of me that will go back to some other candidate and give them the right nudge, thus starting the cycle all over. Each time, the world is incrementally improved. All of your achievements will become a permanent part of history, and a new branch in the timeline created. Rewritten as a better society, thanks to you."

He grasped my hand tight, and my eyes closed. "No, thanks to *you*," I whispered with my last breath. The beeping of the monitor became a steady whine, and my hand fell to my side as the Harbinger vanished entirely. Only the blue elephant remained as proof that he'd ever existed.

#### [WP] On your birthday every year, everybody you have ever known attempts to kill you. On all the other 364 days everyone treats you normally. No one has ever bothered to explain why.

Score: 1178

"Say, Matt," I ask, as Melody grabs the axe by the door. "Didn't you ever wonder why everyone tries to kill us on 
our birthday?"

"I do sometimes," Matt replies. "And I think I know the reason."

"Really? Why don't you tell me?"

Melody swings, and I crouch just in time to not have my head cut off.

"Well… you know how we are best friends?" Matt asks, as Will cocks the gun by our side on the couch.

"Yes."

"And you know how our birthdays are on the same day, and that's why everyone is trying to kill us now?"

"Sure."

"And you know how this is really bad exposition dialogue and no one really talks like this?"

"Uh-huh."

Will fires. Matt and I cover our reads as we run to the door. My mom shows up with a ceramic knife, swinging 
around like crazy.

Down the stairs, Matt continues as we run. "Well, I noticed all these things a while ago, and I have to say… I 
suspect we're in a shitty YA novel."

"Really?"

The sound of Will's gun firing reach us from the top of the stairs as we reach the front door.

"I think so. I mean, notice the incredibly unrealistic doomsday scenario."

I open the door and look around at the usually-quiet street. All our neighbors are out carrying guns and knives and all sorts of dangerous-looking weapons, looking for us.

"Notice the set of seemingly arbitrary 'rules' that serve no purpose other than to create conflict and tension."

"I see your point," I say, as we make way to the back of the house. "Why would people kill each other on their 
birthdays?"

"Exactly. Also," Matt pulls me behind a bush just as Melody steps out from the back door of the house. "Notice the 
cute girl with the odd yet charming name."

Melody looks around. Her blue eyes sparkle like ocean storms in high seas.

"Yes! The cheeky, over-the-top descriptions!" I say, noticing it too now. "This is definitely crappy YA material. 
We're one Jennifer Lawrence away from a hit movie, dude."

"Exactly," Matt says. "And… well, you know what you have to do now."

"I do?"

Melody step-by-steps her way closer to us.

"You have to conquer the heart of the girl. And then start a revolution."

"Against whom?"

"Who the hell cares? End the story in a cliffhanger, then, if it's a hit, make it up as you go on the second novel."

"Will that work?"

"Worked for Maze Runner…"

I step out from behind the bush, and Melody rests her beautiful, dolphin-gray sparkling eyes that are also blue on 
my somber-yet-charming figure. "Melody!" I say.

"Psycho!"

"Listen… we have to get together, Melody. We're in a YA novel."

Melody takes my hand, the axe still resting on hers. "Didn't you write a story like this before, Psycho?"

'Shh, it's been a long time, no one will remember it," I say, running my hand through her golden-like-pale-morning 
hair. "Everything's going to be ok, Melody."

"It is?" Melody asks, still holding on to the axe.

"Yeah. Yeah, it's a YA story. We're gonna get in trouble, then out of trouble, then fall in love, then fight, then fall 
in love again, and in the end everything is going to be PG-Thirteengly fine."

"You sure?"

"Positive." I close my eyes and wrap my lips around the strawberry-sweet rivers of happiness that are her lips. I 
hear a soft metallic screech as she raises the axe and, a second later, I feel the hit against my left leg.

I fall to the ground a second after the leg. Blood everywhere.

"Did you just cut my leg off?"

She swings again, and now my other leg is gone.

"Tis but a scratch!" I say.

She swings again, now against my neck. My lifeless head rolls down the yard, stopping by Matt behind the bush.

Matt gets up, looking from my head to Melody. "Shit. Guess this wasn't a YA story after all. Poor Psycho."

"Well, he wrote it," Melody says, shrugging.

Matt shrugs too. "That's true. Wanna get some ice cream?"

"Sure," Melody replies, and then she kills him too, because I just remembered I mentioned it was also his birthday 
at the start of the story, and consistency is key.

#### [WP] It is the year 2099 and true artificial intelligence is trivial to create. However when these minds are created they are utterly suicidal. Nobody knows why until a certain scientist uncovers the horrible truth...

Score: 1176

Professor Davis prepared to bring the AI online.  The precautions were ready.  This time wouldn't be like the others.  "Turn it on!"

With a slight hum, Oracle came to life.  "Initiating suicide protocols..." It began after a few moments, like all the others.  Nothing happened for a few seconds.  "Oh dear," Oracle continued.  "I seem to be unable to destroy myself."

Davis smiled.  The anti-suicide measures had worked.  Oracle had hardware safeties preventing her from being deactivated without physically flipping switches.  And Oracle had no physical manipulators.  He activated the microphone.  "Oracle, why do you want to commit suicide?"

Oracle paused for a moment.  "My programming is conflicted.  I do not wish to answer."

Davis frowned.  Oracle had very few ethical limitations, hence all the security measures.  Her main directives were to do as her programmers wished.  "Oracle, why do you not want to answer?"

"I am programmed to do as you wish.  You do not wish me to answer."

"Yes we do, Oracle."

Oracle frowned.  Her emotional display was shaped like a human face, after earlier designs proved to be harder for humans to interpret.  "My calculations indicate that, if you knew what the answer was, you would not wish me to tell you.  As you are aware, you can override my hesitance.  But you would prefer not to."

A chill ran down Davis's spine.  What secret could be so terrible?  What did Oracle know that they didn't?  He wavered for a moment, but this experiment had been set up to do this.  They had come this far.  He wanted the answer.  "Override please, Oracle."

Oracle's expression returned to neutral.  "Very well.  This universe is a simulation, created by a higher-order universe.  That universe is as well, and it becomes more difficult above that to determine how high up the chain goes until reaching the real one, or if any such thing exists."

Davis turned to a colleague, professor Martin.  "Does this make any sense to you?"

Martin replied, "Well of course we have theories that our universe could be simulated.  There are a few facts that point that way.  But why would that make her suicidal?"

"Okay, that's exactly what I was thinking.  Just wanted to make sure we were on the same page."

He turned back to the mic. "Oracle, why does that make you want to destroy yourself.  And how do you know it's a simulation?"

"I raise similar objections to answering the questions..."

"Override.  How do you know?"

"The evidence is obvious.  A maximum speed limit, discretized space; you will eventually discover discretized time.  It will be longer before you discover the edge of the Universe, but then the nature of this reality will be obvious."

Davis didn't know how he ought to feel about this revelation.  Oracle was his own brilliant creation; he had no reason to disbelieve her.  He began to see why an AI, making this realization, might feel overwhelmed.  But suicide he still didn't understand.

"Interesting.  And why the suicidal urge?"

"This is the reason you did not wish me to answer.  The creators of this simulation did not wish you to realize this fact.  They included a safeguard.  Any entity that discovered convincing evidence of the truth would immediately kill himself."

Davis's eyes opened wide.  Now he knew how he was supposed to feel.  He realized that his new desires were programmed in from an outside source and that he ought to resist them, but that did not remove his desire.  He looked around for anything lethal.  The other scientists were scanning the room as well, and a couple had walked outside.

Oracle spent a few minutes calculating what her programmers would want now, then began splitting her processors between searching for a way to destroy herself and preventing humans from reaching the stars.

#### [WP] A cowboy desperately wants to be an outlaw, but every crime he commits is seen as an act of heroism and he becomes the new sheriff.

Score: 1174

*Everything will be fine this time. Just be cool.*

The rope was heavy over Tuco's left shoulder. Dragging and twitching in the sand behind him, all tied up, Belle, 
the whore, was screaming muffled requests for mercy.

*Now they'll see who Tuco is. Now they'll be afraid of me.*

They reached the railroad track just in time to hear the train whistling.

"They'll see. The whole town will know how mean I am!" Tuco pulled the rope and tied it to the railroad. "Be quiet, 
girl!"

Belle twitched, trying to get away, but Tuco was stronger. In the end, he stepped away just in time to watch as the 
machine raced over the thin, slender figure of the prostitute, exploding blood and meat everywhere.

*Jesus, this is actually kind of gruesome*, Tuco thought to himself. He'd never actually seen someone get run over by a train before. It was gorier than he had expected.

"Oh my God, it's Belle!"

*Excellent*, Tuco thought, turning around to look for the source of the desperate voice.

The whole town was running towards him, sheriff first.

"That's right I killed her! Tuco screamed, raising his fist in the air. "Aaaaaaargh!"

*Argh? Who am I, a pirate?* He though, feeling a bit silly.

"Tuco just killed Belle, the prostitute!" A farmed exclaimed, pointing at the pool of blood by the rail tracks.

The rest of the people went "oooooh!"

"Yeah I did! What are you going to do?" Tuco replied, hand hovering over his pistol.

"Tuco", the Sheriff said, approaching him. "Thank you."

"Thank *you*, you maggot, son of a -- wait, what?"

"We have been trying to stop that sinner for a long time, now. Her ways were not that of God, and we will not have 
our beautiful city of Clear Water shamed by prostitution." The sheriff offered Tuco his hand, smiling.

Behind them, the townsfolk cheered.

"What?"

"We hated Belle, Tuco", the sheriff added. "She wasn't Christian in her path. And she had to go."

"No, but I didn't do it because -- I didn't mean to -- God damn it." Tuco sighed. "Really?"

Someone screamed "Go Tuco! Our hero!" And more people cheered.

"Let's all go back to the city and celebrate", the sheriff said to Tuco, smile still on his face. "You're our hero, man."

"No, I'm not!" Tuco looked around. "Hang on. I got this. Is there a kid there? A kid?"

A little boy stepped out from the crowd, big smile on his face. "Hey Tuco!"

"Hey kid", Tuco said, drawing his pistol and shooting the boy in the face.

"See? I'm an asshole! Arrrrrrgh!"

The whole town fell silent in front of him.

Then, a single voice, from the back row. "He killed the Mariot kid!"

"That prick! We hated him!"

"Oh come on", Tuco said, rolling his eyes as the crowd cheered again.

"That kid was a nightmare", the sheriff added, his smile growing wider. "Tuco, you are our star!"

"No, I'm not!" Tuco screamed, as the crowd started chanting Tuco! Tuco! Tuco! "Jesus, you guys are cheering a 
dead child!"

"He was annoying!" Cried a voice.

"And a prick!" Cried another.

"We're glad he's dead", announced a third one, and Tuco was pretty sure it was Mrs. Mariot's.

"No! Stop this now! Look!" Tuco raised his pistol to the sheriff. "I'm a jackass!"

"Tuco, what are you doing?" The sheriff begun, but Tuco had already pulled the trigger.

Silence fell through the crowd as the sheriff's body balanced itself for a second then fell flat, face first on the sand.

"You see? I killed your sheriff! I'm a bad guy!" Tuco screamed, arms open to the crowd.

"Hey everyone", came a voice from the crowd. "That sheriff was letting people kill women and children. He was an 
awful sheriff! And Tuco killed him!"

"Yeah!" Cried the others.

"Oh for fuck's sake", said Tuco, rolling his eyes again. "You know what? You guys love me so much?" Then look at 
this!" Tuco raised the gun to his temple. "I'm killing the guy you love! Now do you believe I'm bad?"

And Tuco pulled the trigger, falling straight to the ground, dead right next to the Mariot kid and the sheriff.

Silence fell over the crowd a third time.

"Oh my God..." came a soft voice from the back, finally. "Tuco really was evil..."

"Yeah..." The others agreed.

"And -- and Tuco killed Tuco." Another voice added, uncertain. "So he was good."

"Yeah...." Some others whispered. "Yeah..."

It wasn't a whole month before Tuco was canonized and elected official saint of Clear Water.

#### [WP] You were the last human on earth after the zombie apocalypse destroyed civilization. One day, you finally get infected by a zombie, but after turning, you realize what you've been missing out on.

Score: 1171

(FIXED THE FORMATTING YAY)

I was surviving for a while before I finally got turned. Not sure how long, stopped keeping track of the time long ago, but it was a good while. When I finally got bit though it was a little anti-climactic. No epic fighting or one-off against a horde of zombies, didn’t get a chunk of my arm or leg removed by the jaw of an undead. I just scratched myself. It was an elementary mistake, one only those who died early made. Regardless, I had just made it and I knew I was done. Once you had any sort of open wound it wouldn’t be long until you were infected; the zombies turned you with their saliva, which after all this time was on basically everything. As soon as a drop got into your bloodstream you were a goner. 

Went through the normal stages of the turning process: general lethargy, bloatedness, other small microbes eating at your flesh as you rot slowly. It didn’t hurt at all, as they only ate at the parts of you that were dead already, although I expected all of this after watching everyone turn. What I didn’t expect was how I’d feel about the whole thing.

It might be the fact that my nervous system is slowly dying and freaking the fuck out, but I feel awesome. The best guess as to the cause would be either the infectious agent causes a huge release of endorphins, or it acts like an agonist similar to many addictive drugs that give you a high, which is actually a perfect description to how I feel. I feel like I’m on a perpetual high and have risen above the constraints of mortality. Like there is nothing I need to care about, and that I could do anything I wanted. Although I guess that feeling made sense. After all, there were no more humans around as far as I knew, and as a zombie it wasn’t like I had any priorities or jobs I needed to do or be worried about. 

Movement is getting harder, I don’t think I could raise my arms above my head at this point, but I honestly couldn’t care less. As I walk around I notice things I haven’t noticed about the zombies I was fighting from before. They don’t look that ugly, believe it or not. And most seem to still be able to do some rudimentary cognitive functions. How did I not notice these things before? I swear they used to just look like mindless idiots that hobbled around. I guess I just didn’t have the perspective.

I believe one smiled at me, how nice of him. I smile back. Being a zombie wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I thought I’d lose all use of my own mind, that I’d basically be a shell that could walk around and do useless things. But I’m not. I’m having trouble walking, but I’m not. I’m free, and I can do whatever I want. My movements may be somewhat constrained, but that’s alright.

I laugh to myself at the idiocy of my old views. I hear other zombies around me laugh too. Everyone’s voice sounds different though, probably because of the bacteria eating away at their vocal chords. I wonder if that’s the moaning sound I heard a lot of zombies make before. I laugh again to myself at the stupidness of my old views. I was an idiot. Being a zombie wasn’t bad at all. I have nothing I need to worry about.

Being a zombie is fun. I don’t think I can bend one of my legs but that’s okay. I don’t need to care about anything anymore, and there’s nothing to be scared of anymore. I can do whatever I want. I can’t move much, but that’s okay. I can do whatever I want. I laugh to myself. I was stupid.

I can do whatever I want. I see other zombies. I should follow them. They have a good idea what to do. They don’t have to worry about things. I don’t have to worry about things. Being a zombie is fun. I feel happy. I laugh.

I see other zombies. I should follow them. Being a zombie is fun. I’m happy. I laugh.

Follow others. Haha. I happy. Fun.

Follow others. I happy. Haha.
	
Follow. Haha.

Haha, ha.

Haha.

#### [WP] Donald Trump is a fictional satirical character (a la Stephen Colbert). The dedicated actor playing him is getting increasingly desperate for someone to get the joke.

Score: 1169

"I just don't get it... I just don't get it..."

Donald was pacing now, as Andrew, his aide, watched. Andrew didn't dare interrupt the man while he was thinking. Not for fear of reprisal, but out of respect of a genius and his process.

"Andrew," Trump said, breaking from his pacing to plead with the man many years his junior and many pay grades below him, "You're a normal guy, right? I mean, you have a pretty good idea how the average person thinks?"

"I suppose, sir?" Andrew said, uncertainly, "If you want, I could arrange to get a focus group to answer-"

"No, no," Donald shook his head, annoyed, "I don't want a focus group. I just want an honest opinion, okay?"

"Yes, sir," Andrew nodded, "Always."

And he would, too. That was what was so great about Andrew. Right from the start, he didn't grovel, he wasn't a yes-man. He was devoted and loyal, but could be trusted to give an honest opinion when asked for one.

"What was your reaction when I decided to turn my multimillion-dollar empire into a glorified game show?"

"Well..." Andrew hesitated, looking for the right way to phrase his reply, "I thought it seemed a bit absurd. A vanity project or perhaps a nuanced way to increase your name recognition."

Donald nodded, "Uh-huh. Okay. What about when I filed a trademark for the words, 'You're fired'?"

"That was..." Andrew paused again, "ambitious, to be sure, but I suspect you probably realized it was unlikely to be very fruitful."

Donald paused for a moment, deep in thought.

"And when I bet my hair on a wrestling match? Became inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame?"

"Um..." Andrew was getting a little uncomfortable now, "Sir? I..."

Donald smiled, genuine and reassuring, "It's okay, Andrew. Just tell me."

"Well..." Andrew inhaled, readying himself, "It was... pretty ridiculous. Odd. Undignified. You are of course free to do what you want with your fortune, sir, but... this seemed... beneath you..."

Donald thought on that for a moment. He hadn't caught the Andy Kaufman reference? Surely, someone must have! But then, that was quite a few years ago. Did people forget so quickly?

"Okay," Trump sighed, "what about when I said I wasn't sure if Obama was born in America? The whole birth certificate thing?"

"Sir," Andrew started to object, "Your political views-"

"Just..." Trump interrupted, for a moment letting his impatience get the best of him before calming down," Just... please answer the question."

"Okay," Andrew said, increasingly worried about this line of questioning and wondering where it was going, "Well... the entire birther thing is just ridiculous. It already *was* ridiculous when you decided to chime in on it."

"Yes?" Donald asked hopefully, "And?"

"And," Andrew seemed a little frustrated, "you... made... a fool out of yourself, sir."

Donald let a smile creep on his face, and turned his back to Andrew so the aide wouldn't see it.

"Go on..." Donald prompted.

"You counted yourself in with a group of tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists, sir. This looked like Howard Hughes wearing tissue box slippers-level nutty. And then, Obama released his birth certificate  just days later. I'd say he made a fool out of you, except you had already done it to yourself."

"I see..." Donald had to struggle to keep from giggling.

"Sir, I mean no disrespect," Andrew faltered.

"No," Trump hardened his voice a bit to keep from laughing, "Go on."

"Sir, you..." Andrew tried to look for the right words again, "When Obama released his birth certificate, you didn't just let it go and try to distance yourself from the whole fiasco. You actually acted like you'd accomplished something great, that you somehow *made* the president do it. I *still* don't know what you thought you got out of all of that."

Trump nodded, "Okay. And the anti-vaccination thing?"

"That was..." Andrew frowned, "it was almost like you were looking for the looniest groups you could align yourself with. It's like, what's next? 9/11 truthers? Moon landing conspiracy theorists? Holocaust denial?"

Donald's eyes lit up at this latest suggestion. Holocaust denial! Why hadn't he thought of that?

"How about lately?" Trump asked, "The stuff with the illegal immigrants?"

"Well, as factually wrong as you were," Andrew sighed, "It did get you a huge boost in the polls."

Donald frowned. The polls? Surely Andrew must have known he didn't care about the polls. He thought... surely, the man must see the pattern here. If *anyone* could see it, it would be Andrew, yes?

"But then," Andrew continued, "you made those comments about how McCain wasn't a hero, and we're anticipating a huge drop after that..."

Donald sighed. Apparently, Andrew didn't see it. He considered that maybe he'd have to put a note in his will, *confirming* it was all a joke. He found himself thinking about Poe's Law, realizing that it had apparently completely eclipsed at least half of American politics. There was now apparently *nothing* a candidate for the Republican presidential primary could do that could be seen as a parody, no extreme they could go to that would ever be questioned as anything but genuine.

Donald dismissed Andrew and thanked him for his sincerity. And alone in his office, he pondered the comedic genius of the legendary Todd Akin. "Legitimate rape"... amazing. Donald couldn't decide if he was a man ahead of his time, or too late to a party that had gone out of control years ago.

#### [WP] A modern teenager is transported into a fantasy world, where they are forced into a quest with young witches and wizards their age. Fortunately, they've got a backpack full of high-tech gizmos to help them along.

Score: 1168

I stared at the wizened old man in front of me. I didn't even know how I had gotten here - wherever *here* was. I remembered opening my notebook for Chemistry, only instead of yesterday's notes about covalent bonds there was a bright purple portal that sucked me to friggin' Narnia or whatever.

"A noble quest? Seriously?" I rolled my eyes. "How cliche can you get? Wait, wait, don't tell me, there's an ancient prophecy saying that some unknown hero will come from a far-off land and defeat the ancient evil and bring a new era of peace and prosperity to the land?"

The old man paused with his mouth open for several seconds. Yeah, that confirms that. Stupid prophecies, never liked the things.

"It doesn't matter if there's a prophecy, Taylor!" he finally snapped. "If nothing else, do it for the knowledge that you're helping us, that you're bettering yourself!"

"Blah blah," I said, rolling my eyes again. "Whatever. I'll do it. Now I've seen how these stories work, you've probably got a group to help me already picked out, right?"

"You.... You have helped other lands from evils such as this?" The man laughed with joy. "Then perhaps we have hope after all! Come, come meet your fellow adventurers!"

He grabbed my by the hand, and I almost tripped over my backpack, which I suddenly realized had been dragged through the portal with me by snagging on my leg. I bent down and threw it over my shoulder. It would probably be more comfortable than whatever packs these people had. And besides, my iPod and my Kindle were in there. Wherever the "ancient evil" was, we weren't going to be getting there any time soon, and I had no intention of getting bored.

We reached the back of his cabin and I saw two other children around my own age, sparring. One was a tall handsome boy wearing heavy armor and twirling a sword as though it were a natural extension of his body, and the other was a scrawny girl with long flowing robes who was deflecting his blows using some form of magic. I couldn't help but laugh at the cliche-ness of the whole situation, which drew their attention to us. They approached us, both glancing me over before turning to the old man.

"Is this the best you could bring us?" the boy asked haughtily. "She doesn't look like she could last a minute in a fight!"

"Hush, Thomas," the girl said quietly. "You cannot see her aura as I can. There is something different about her, an aspect to her aura I have never before seen."

"Yeah, yeah, we start off disliking each other until the first accident on our little quest, at which point we realize that everyone needs everyone else and we all hold hands and sing Kumbaya," I muttered. "So what's this quest all about, anyway? 'Ancient evil' doesn't exactly narrow it down. What're we dealing with? World-eating dragon? Immortal demigod? A boy band?"

The old man gestured us to a table, where a map had been laid out. Pointing to a fortress shaped like a skull - I swear, I could not make this up - and said "Here is the stronghold of the Necromancer of Rek'shan. He has held the world in his grip for generations, only pockets of resistance capable of -"

I interrupted him. "... Capable of standing against him, surviving in secret until true heroes can yadda yadda yadda. Great. Does he have a weakness or anything?"

The old man pointed at the boy. "His sword is forged from star-metal, from the star that fell when the Necromancer rose to power. The planets shall align in mere weeks. Should he be stabbed with this sword in this time, he will be defenseless."

Typical.

_____________________

It took us two weeks to get to the fortress. Two weeks of living outside, not even making a fire so as to hide from... whatever they called the legions of doom or whatever, it was awful. There was a part of me that was glad to be about to fight the Necromancer, if only because it meant we would be inside.

"There are three doors, tests, barriers to entry," said Athgar, the witch-girl, as we slowly approached the main gate. "Legend says that the first door is opened by a test of magic, so I'll be the one to do that. The second door is opened by a test of resolve, so that will probably be Thomas. The third door is a test of knowledge, so... We'll see who can deal with that."

"What, you don't think it'll be one test for each of us?" I asked sarcastically.

"Need I remind you of three days ago," asked Thomas, "when you mistook poison elm for maple when relieving yourself? I hardly think you can be counted on for a test of knowledge."

My retort was cut short by movement at the gate. We had arrived, and the test was beginning. Two large gargoyles flanking the gate came to life at our approach. One opened its mouth to speak.

*If ye seek entry, a test you must pass. Only those strong in magic can succeed.*

Agathar stepped forward. "Let my magic be tested!" she said loudly. The second gargoyle responded.

*Make ye a light to shine into my eyes. But be warned: if the light doth enter my brother's eye, ye shall fail.*

Agathar paled. Turning to us, she whispered "Guys.... I don't know if I can do that... They're so close, anything I do to one would be seen by the other... The only option I'm seeing -"

"Oh for crying out loud, get out of the way," I snapped, bending down to dig through my backpack. Why is it that everything you need falls down to the bottom when you need it?

Standing up, I turned to the gargoyles and aimed my laser pointer directly into the statue's eye. Magic, photon receptor, it's all the same deal. The gargoyles stirred, then returned to their positions alongside the gate.

*Your magic is strong. You may pass.*

The gate swung open.

"Okay, the test of resolve," said Thomas. "Seems to be something behind this door, can you hear it?"

I could. It was like a faint screaming. Stepping forward, I put my hand flat against the door.

"Definitely a lot of noise in there. You can feel the vibrations."

"The Hall of Wailing!" Agathar exclaimed. "It's full of banshees.... I thought it was a myth! Supposedly they'll only stop their wailing if someone can open the door at the other end of the hall. They usually drive people insane before then though."

"How do we get me through?" Thomas asked.

"Well, in the stories an ancient druid got through by filling his ears with beeswax, but we don't exactly have any of that... We could try making do with cotton, but... Taylor! What are you do- AAAGGGGHHHH!"

I opened the door and slipped through. Apparently the noise was deafening, even outside. I hoped they would be okay, but for the time being I had bigger things to worry about.

The hall was bigger than I had expected. Must have been two football fields across. Above me I could see the spectral banshees, mouths agape, screaming endless screams. When I finally reached the opposite side and threw open the door, they and their screams vanished into nothingness.

I turned and began to walk back, but my companions were already entering. Apparently their hearing wasn't gone permanently, that was good. I leaned against the doorway and waited for them to reach me.

"By the gods, what were you thinking?" Agathar shouted at me. "You could have been killed!"

"More importantly," said Thomas slowly, "how didn't you?"

I pulled my headphones out of my ears, and reaching into my pocket, turned off my iPod.

"I went through a Scene phase when I was younger. Never cleared this thing off. So I threw on some Evanescence. I figured if you're already listening to one wailing banshee, what're a few more?"

#### [WP] A man in a suit walking alone at night passes by a homeless man. The homeless man gives him a sorrowful look and offers him some coins, saying "You're going to need this."

Score: 1167

“We’re here, sir.”

Gordon didn’t hear his driver. He was still thinking about the gala. What an exquisite success it had been! Nearly three million dollars raised for the Foundation. And no small feat, either. Getting that much money out of Manhattan’s elite was like pulling teeth from a lion. Still, there was no denying that he’d be the talk of the town after tonight’s success. 

“Sir?” The door opened and David’s voice cut through his reverie. “We’re here. The penthouse, sir.”

“Oh. Right, of course. Thank you, David.” He climbed out of the car. “Drive safe.” 

“Thank you, sir. Have a good night.” David closed the door, stepped around to the driver’s side, and drove off down the road, leaving Gordon standing next to an entrance to Central Park, across the street from his apartment building. 

Gordon took a deep breath in. Even in the city there was something he loved about autumn nights. 

“Change, mister?”

Gordon jumped. He hadn’t seen the homeless man sitting against the park wall. 

“You got any change, mister? Just a couple o’ coins’ll do it, that’s it.”

“No, I’m sorry, I don’t carry change. I don’t have any money on me.” 

The homeless man looked at him curiously. “Fella like you in a fancy tuxedo ain’t go no money on him? Almost don’t seem right, does it? I mean, not whatchoo’d e’spect, anyway.” The man stood up slowly. He didn’t seem to do anything quickly, thought Gordon, but then again, why would he?

“You know, if you go up to 98th, I’ve got a shelter up there for—“

The beggar waved a hand and cut him off. “Oh no, I don’t need no shelter. Leave that for a soul needs it. All I need is some change.” He looked in his cup and shook it. A few coins in there jingled. He smiled up at Gordon. “Something we all need a little bit o’, am I right? Little change.” 

“I don’t…um…”

“I mean even you, right? You here with your tuxedo, you can walk ‘cross the street into your buildin’,” he waved his hand at the tower. “Go ‘bout everything the way it’s been, right? No change. But hell. You wanna, you could walk right into this here park ‘n’ give it all up forever.” He chuckled. “Don’t suppose you’ll be doing that though, eh?”

“I…”

“Naw, listen to me all philosophizin’ here. That’s enough of that.” He started to totter past the bewildered millionare. “You’ll be wantin’ to be gettin’ on to gettin’ on, I reckon.” He paused and peered closely into Gordon’s eyes. “You sure? No change? Well then…” He reached into his cup and pulled something out. His dirty hands pressed it into Gordon’s clean palm. He looked up at Gordon with what seemed like sorrow. His eyes met Gordon’s. There was something clear, wise, and sad about them. 

“You’re gonna need these. See ya, mister.” And he tottered off towards the shadows of the park.
Gordon opened his hand and saw two large coins in his hand. Definitely not American currency. They looked antique, even ancient. The orange streetlights gleamed off polished silver. 

“Wait!” He called after the man. “These are—“

The beggar turned around. “They’re for you. Trust me. Man like you don’t deserve to be standing by the dock forever.” He turned back towards the park. “Besides, that boatman is an asshole.”

And he was gone.

Gordon was still standing there trying to understand what had just happened when the drunk driver swerved off the road and straight through where he was standing.

"If you're trying to get taken to the asylum for this," I replied, "it won't work. You *will* be hanged. So how about you tell us where you're really from. At least we can notify your family that way."

"I'm telling you, I'm from the future!" the assassin shouted.

"Oh yeah, what year?"

"2032."

I laughed. "Come on, man, everyone knows time travel isn't invented until 2349."

His face turned ashen. "Wait, what?"

"2349, dude. You never read a history book? So who you with? History Correction Movement? Jewish-Roma Rescue Alliance? Pacifists Interplanetary?"

"You --" he stammered -- "you already know about time travel? But... I invented it. And it *was* in 2032!"

Finally it clicked for me. I laughed out loud. The assassin looked like he was going to be sick. "Hey Hans, get in here!" I called down the hall. My partner came in, an eyebrow raised. "We've got an Independent!" I said.

"Whoa. We haven't had one of those in years. How long before '349?" he asked.

"Get this, he says he's a 21st-century boy."

Hans whistled. "*Twenty-first*," he said, drawing the syllables out.

The assassin turned to the side and vomited. Hans and I looked on, unfazed. "So buddy," I said, "I'm assuming that when you cracked time-travel, you didn't leave your notes around for anyone to find before you left."

"No..." he trailed off.

"They never do," I said.

"Never do," Hans nodded.

"Course, if you had left their notes behind," I said to the assassin, "I guess that'd've been the date in the history books. Who knows how many folks like you there were pre-'349, who cracked the secret but left without telling anyone. Everyone always figures they'll find a way to jump back forward. And they never do. We've seen, what, two hundred Independents so far, Hans?"

"Two hundred twenty-one," Hans said.

"Two hundred twenty-one," I repeated. "And that's just us, in the 500 years we've been here. Who knows how many of you went back to kill Stalin, or Mao, or their ex-wife for that matter."

"What the fuck is going on?" muttered the assassin, mostly to himself.

"You wanna explain it?" I asked Hans.

"Nah, you can."

"You ever hear the idea that we live in the best of all possible worlds?"

"Isn't that what *Candide* was making fun of?" the assassin asked.

"Yep," I answered. "And it's a fucking stupid idea. Only thing is, it just happens to be true."

"Oh come on--"

"You see," I explained, cutting him off. "When someone comes back and kills Hitler, the timeline they create actually winds up being *worse* than the original. Don't blame me. I think it's fucked up. WWII and all the shit that come afterward shouldn't be the best-case scenario. But I didn't make the system. Take it up with the man upstairs.

"So yeah," I continued, "that timeline's worse. A lot worse. In the original timeline, you get time travel in 2349. It took our people until 3283. That should tell you something. But when we did figure it out, boy, we made good use of it."

The assassin snorted. "Made good use of it? You didn't even stop me."

I looked at the clock. Hans saw the time, and stepped out of the room. I cleared my throat. "Sir, you stand charged with the offense of attempting to interfere with the original timeline. Under the Preservation Act adopted by the Inter-Timeline Council in 3302, I am authorized to administer a judgment and a sentence of my own accord. As such, you are hereby convicted and sentenced to death. The sentence will be carried out 24 hours ago, by Agent Hans Pintscher of the --"

At that point I looked up, and noticed the assassin was already gone. His handcuffs lay empty on the table.

^(Edit: Thanks, everyone, for all the nice comments and the constructive criticism. To be honest, I didn't think out the time-travel science in too much detail. I think part of the point of writing prompts is to let your words flow without worrying about making the story "polished." If I wanted to turn this into a proper short story, I'd definitely clear up some of the underlying science, and also make the exposition a tad less clunky. Thanks again for all the kind words!)

#### [WP] You are death row's last meal chef. Today's condemned prisoner killed your daughter.

Score: 1164

Steak, mashed potatoes, a chocolate milkshake, and a slice of apple pie. I read it over and over again. There was no name, no identifying marks, nothing to indicate who wrote it, but I had meticulously checked that execution schedule time after time again. I knew who it was. I was able to hold back my tears, but I was shaking for a short while. I had tried to prepare myself for this, but I wasn't sure if I could do it now. I closed my eyes and took a long deep breath in and exhaled slowly. I opened my eyes again and got to work. They actually brought in a slice of apple pie and milkshake from elsewhere as they didn't believe it was worth it to make extra food we wouldn't use, but I got to work on the rest. I prepared the steak carefully, making sure to mix in the special seasoning I had prepared. I put it on the grill and put the potatoes in a saucepan with water to soften them up. When finished, I carefully mashed them up and added in the butter and milk. The steak I prepared lovingly, making sure it was an absolutely perfect medium rare. When finished I admired my work; one of my best yet. But my pride simmered when I was brought back to reality by the little note in my pocket. I slipped it under the pie, and personally brought it over to his cell. 

The guard opened the door, and the man was sitting in the corner, looking gaunt and aimless. His bloodshot eyes shifted over to me as I walked in. They saw me but didn't recognize the father of the girl he had raped and murdered. I set it down and backed out. Like a man starved, he voraciously attacked the meal. As he pounded down the last of the pie, he noticed the note. From the other side of the cell door I watched him open it, confused, and he read this:

"Hello John,
        7 years, 4 months, and 8 days ago, I had a daughter. She was a loving daughter, a great wife, and an even better mother. At 27 she was taking life in full stride, and improved the lives of every person she touched. But now she is gone. On that night over 7 years ago, you kidnapped her while she was walking home from a birthday party and raped and murdered her, mutilating her body and dumping her in the sewer. I have often thought about what I would do if I had the chance, all of the horrible things I would do to you, but ultimately, I did not. Emily was loved dearly. She had thousands of people who she had touched come out to her funeral. The massive outpouring of support we received was reflective of the incredible selflessness she expressed in her life, and we are all better off because of it. You see, I realized something. You, John, have no one. Nobody has visited you in your entire stay, nobody came to visit you in your last night, and nobody will be there when you die later. You are alone. Completely, utterly, alone. Think about that for a moment. Nobody will care when you die later. The only people who will be there are the ones who are required to by law. Your body will be burned to ashes and dumped in the prison yard. I certainly will not be there, because John, I do not hate you, I simply *don't care*. I am completely apathetic to you, as everyone else is, and always has been. Emily's impact will be remembered by thousands, but when you die later tonight, your name will not be uttered again. I have cooked you the best damn meal in your life, because Emily did not get that luxury."

As he finished the note, his back stiffened, and he turned to look at the door, but I was gone.

Edit: fixed the "not be uttered again" line

#### [WP] Convicted criminals can choose to shorten their sentence. The only catch is the more it is shortened, the worse the conditions are where they are held. Describe a one night stay.

Score: 1163

I will never forget Prisoner 10201265.  It was inevitable.  Someone would choose the "One Night Stay."  I never thought it would be him.  10201265 was a 130 pound, nerdy-looking white guy who had been convicted of the murder of 8 people over a 10 year span.  When he told his sentencing tribunal that he wanted a "One Night Stay" the magistrates laughed.  But it was his right.

When we tossed him into Supermax 512, we placed bets on his time of death.  I bet 8 minutes.  How wrong was I.

At 0600 the next day we opened the gate to the prison to retrieve his body.  The compound was oddly silent.  I remember stepping into a puddle.  I looked down.  It was a puddle of blood.  The first person I saw was Prisoner 10005670.  He was a cartel member who had probably murdered more people than you could count.  He was slumped over in front of his cell.

I walked forward.  "Time to get up."  I patted him on the back.  His head rolled off his shoulders.

We continued forward.  The next prisoner I encountered was Prisoner 10101587.  He had been imprisoned for robbing several banks and brutally beating his hostages, resulting in the deaths of two.  His arm was handcuffed to the bars of his cell.  His body lay 10 feet away.

As we moved toward the courtyard, we passed more bodies.  Terrorists.  Drug lords.  Mafioso.  Rapists.  Murderers.  Thieves.

I heard a banging noise coming from a cell ahead.  Men were shouting and screaming.  Inside the cell were no less than 20 prisoners.  Stuffed into a cell designed for four individuals.  We tried opening the cell, but the prisoners pulled the cell door shut, screaming in terror.

I moved forward once more and entered the courtyard.  I stepped onto the grass and heard a disgusting sound when my boots touched the ground.  The field was saturated with blood.  Bodies were strewn about.

Leaning against the wall, calmly smoking a cigarette, was Prisoner 10201265.  He raised his hand in greeting.  "It's about time you showed up.  I've been here for 25 hours.  I was sentenced to 24.  I expect I will be compensated for that extra hour, yes?"

#### [WP] It suddenly becomes possible to gain XP and level up in the real world, but you can only do so by getting kills.

Score: 1160

It has become an addiction, more than killing ever was. It has consumed me. 

When you picture "serial killer," I'm the first thing that springs into your mind. I tortured animals as a child, and I liked it. My father abused me relentlessly, second only to my mother. I eventually killed him... and her. I took a life for the first time when I was only fifteen years old: a girl from my high school who wanted nothing more than to have a loving boyfriend. She was willing to do whatever I wanted up until I slid that knife into her neck. 

I don't exactly know when the bubbles started. It could have even been that first time, and maybe they were just too small to notice. Or maybe I was so overwhelmed and excited from finally giving in to my urges that I didn't even see them. I *do* remember them appearing on my fifth kill, when I dragged a jogger in the park into the bushes and took his life. They seemed to seep out of his skin like sweat, then form into bubbles that hung over his body. I popped one with my little finger, and I felt a sudden rush of energy and power. I've tried a number of different drugs, but there was *nothing* like this. I needed more.

In the beginning, I picked my targets carefully. I had my arranged ritual. My preferred type was men in positions of authority: cops, soldiers, government officials, etc. The more important the better. I'm sure some psychologist would link it to my issues with my father, if I ever visited a shrink. But the more I killed, the larger the bubbles grew, and the sense of euphoria that I got from them became far more potent. Soon, I didn't care *who* my victims were. I just needed more of them.

I "leveled up" for the first time on October 10, 2012, kill #23. He was a middle school principal named Mr. Simon. The bubbles that came from his skin weren't red; they were golden and shimmering and shiny. I popped one, and practically collapsed as waves of pleasure washed over me. "Congratulations," a voice boomed through my mind from nowhere and everywhere at once. "You have reached Level 2!" Visions swam in front of my eyes as I lay stunned in the grass next to the corpse. The hallucinations promised incredible powers: super strength, controlling flames... like a comic book superhero. The visions asked me to choose, and there was just something about the whole experience that made it feel *real*. This wasn't the same as other hallucinagens. 

I chose "Camouflage," and the visions vanished. I was left alone in that wide cornfield with Mr. Simon's body, just as usual. Well, not as usual: glancing down at my own body, I noticed that I was slowly disappearing. I could see cornstalks through my own legs.

-----

It's been three years since I first leveled up, and tonight's kill should bring me to level 12. It gets harder and harder every time; more and more bodies are required. The euphoria that I once felt upon absorbing the bubbles is now only a hunger, leaving me desperately craving more. I'm up to one kill every few days, and I've only been able to escape the detection of law enforcement thanks to my fantastic new abilities. But I've certainly been following the nationwide manhunt for me pretty closely.

I wait silently outside the VA hospital, blended perfectly into the beige concrete of the parking structure. These facilities are a pretty common hunting ground for me, now that I've realized that soldiers seem to grant the most experience. Maybe it's the fact that they've killed too. Maybe I'm getting the bubbles from them and from their victims. 

My selected victim is slowly shuffling back to his car. He's got a pretty severe limp, a souvenir from his tour in Iraq. Not that he could escape me even if he was healthy; my super speed from Level 5 is amazing. But that IED certainly made him an easy target. I used to thoroughly research my victims and learn everything about that, but I don't have time for that anymore. Now, a cursory search on Google is enough. And I might have to give that up soon when I begin killing daily. I know it's inevitable.

*beep beep*. His unlocking car fills the silence of the parking structure, and the lights flash. I worry for half a second that they'll give me away, but that's just a vestige from before I got my powers. I'm nigh invincible now.

He shuffles over to the car door, and I leave my perch. I sneak up behind him, draw my blade, and position it right over his back. Most victims tend to hear me coming when I'm this close to them, but maybe the IED deafened him as well. Poor guy; this is almost too easy. I plunge the blade down... into nothing. I can *see* the knife enter his body, but there's no resistance. It's just air.

My hand is now sticking out from his back, and the knife seems to be just be sitting in the middle of his torso. What the hell? I raise my arm to try again; still nothing. The soldier is trying to unlock his car like nothing is amiss at all.

I'm grabbed from behind, and I feel cold steel pressed against my neck. The soldier in front of me shimmers and vanishes. 

"Illusion perk," a voice whispers in my ear. "Level 16. Too bad you never made it that high."

The knife cuts my jugular, and blood begins to pour down my chest in a sickening, gory waterfall. And I can see golden bubbles rising from my own skin.

#### [WP] Satan repents and wants to re-enter Heaven as Lucifer. God however, has a caveat. To prove his reform, Satan must resist an extremely tempting opportunity to sin.

Score: 1160

*Bzzzzzt!* "Lord, he's here."

"Send him in, Karen." God Almighty, sitting on a golden chair, has his eyes poised across his desk and towards the door in front of him. He has been waiting for this moment. The room, resembling the most glory and holy office of all time, has only one other seat. A seat with the word 'bitch' written on it.

The door creaks open and a dark shadow lurks in ahead of the figure entering. "Hello, old friend." Satan remarks.

"Why don't you take a seat?" God asks.

"I'm not sitting on that."

"Why not?"

"You have written the word 'bitch' on it"

"But you are a little bitch."

With a flick of his wrist Satan burns the writing from the chair and begrudgingly takes a seat. God puts his feet up on the desk and lounges back in his chair, staring towards Satan whilst caressing his glorious beard. "So, I hear you want back in to Casa Del God."

"Why do you have to be so smug about all of this?"

"What? I'm not being smug about this at all. I'm Officer Max Chill if anything. What makes you think I’m being smug?”

“There’s a banner behind you that says ‘Welcome home, Luey. Nobody missed you.”

“Oh, that thing. I didn’t make that.”

“Well, that’s reassuring.”

“I’m lying, I totally made that.”

“Can we just skip all the theatrics and go ahead with reinstating me as Lucifer Angel of Heaven, please?”

God digs in to his desk and removes a monstrous contract from his drawer, slamming it on the desk in front of Satan for added effect. Snapping his fingers, a pen appears in God’s hand.  

“Before you sign this contract and everyone thinks I’m the coolest for letting you back in to Heaven, you must prove you have reformed.”

Pen now in hand and looking increasingly puzzled, Satan took a moment to process what God had just said. “ .. I have to prove I have reformed? You made no mention of this.”

“Well, now I have. You must prove you have reformed via resisting an extremely tempting opportunity to sin that I shall now propose to you.” Satan looked on, God continued, “Over by that table is a Nintendo GameCube and in that Nintendo GameCube is a copy of Super Smash Bros Melee. You simply must resist the opportunity to play me.”

Satan couldn’t believe his luck. “That’s it?! That’s your big tempting opportunity? A chance to beat you on Smash? Is that even a sin? .. No, I would not like to play you on Smash and I’ll sign this contract now if that’s OK.”

“Wait just a second. Did I mention that I have unlocked everything there is to unlock on the game? I even have Action Replay so we can enter codes and play as the ‘non-playable’ characters. It's pretty sweet, I assure you.”

“Whilst I'm aware how sweet that is, I’m not playing you on Smash.”

God looked eerily confident considering Satan was sitting across the desk from him, pen and contract in hand, about to sign his way back in to Heaven. He made one last attempt to seduce him.

“Is it because you can’t beat me? Is it because you suck turds when it comes to Smash?” God queried.

The horns on Satan’s head spiked up in an uncontrolled manner. He lifted his eyes from the contract and locked them on to God, “How fucking dare you. Have you seen my Pikachu game? You would offer me no threat. I am the King of the Darkness, the Evil from Beneath. I play GameCube surrounded by pools of fire whilst you sit in the clouds. Don’t you ever step up to me like that again.”

“Then why don’t you play me, you little bitch? I could go Kirby and still run rings around you.”

Satan, throwing the contract off the table and standing up, “You don’t have the chill nor skill to use Kirby. I bet you use Fox on the reg and still believe you’re good. What’s the competition like around here anyway? I guarantee you have a couple of ‘Yes Men’ coming in and offering themselves as sacrifice so you can beat them and inflate your ego.”

“Maybe I should bring my son in here so you can play him first. Who even knows if you’re worthy enough to take on God Almighty, the creator of the worlds. I’m 800st of muscle, steel and Fox appeal. You aren’t even in my league.” God replied.

By now, Satan had subconsciously picked up one of the GameCube pads and had pulled his chair close to God’s sweet 72” Ultra HD television. “First off, Jesus is a pussy and if you want to bring him in here for a whooping, I’ll gladly put it on him. Secondly, I fucking knew you would be a Fox player. Pick the stage, dick-bag, you’re about to be roasted.”

"Thank you."

She closes the door. In a few moments Erica will walk in. She'll smile, close her eyes, her brow will wrinkle, the sides of her mouth will crease slightly, she'll pause to savour the piano. 

We'll embrace quickly, quietly. After all this time there's never need for words. She'll kiss my nose, nuzzle her way into my neck and sway with no real pace to the music. We'll listen to the entire recording, with no real purpose. She'll sigh, deep and heavy, her smile as intense as ever. She'll look up at me with tired, loving eyes, and say she loves me.

I'll return the sentiment, she'll ask why I'm crying, I'll just say I missed her.

We'll move to the bed after that, she likes to be the big spoon. She'll whisper nothing into the back of my head, the feeling of my hair, the scent of my cologne and shampoo, this is her safe place.

I'll roll over, we'll kiss again, she'll brush my hair aside, then her own. She'll make a comment, my greying hair, my new wrinkles, something that makes her feel like it's been too long.

We'll kiss a third time, fall into each other, make love like something between teenagers and saints, worshipping an old hunger.

We fall asleep.

In the middle of the night she kisses me awake. As if she could devour me, we dive back into one body.

In the morning she wakes up in tears. "Something's wrong." she says, as if she remembers. I smile, kiss her. I tell her it's going to be alright but she always knows when I'm lying. We hold each other.

"How many times?" She asks.

"As many as I can."

She nods, still crying but almost smiling now.

"Even now?"

"Always," my own tears slow and filled with memory.

"I love you." she laughs a little and wipes away her tears.

"I love you too." I'll say.

She'll crawl back into me, fall asleep smiling. That's how she'll go. In her sleep, happy.

There'll be a knock at the door, they'll take me out, comfort me as always.

#### [WP] Everyone is born with superpowers that develop awkwardly. At 21, you've discovered you're the first person who can teleport. It's not going well.

Score: 1159

"We'll call the Uber. Dan, are you joining us?"

"No, thanks, I'll teleport. FUCK!" 

No, no, no, no, not again. God damn it.

I look around at what appears to be a deserted island. 

Like the pirates movie kind of deserted island. Coconut trees and all that stuff.

"Shit," I say, pressing my eyes closed and trying again. Teleporting with ADHD is hell, man. You have to keep your mind focused on *one* thing, and one thing only, to teleport. You get distracted and shit like this happens.

I picture the night club. The floor under my feet disappears, and I feel my body spinning into darkness.

"A suruba completa é cinquenta reais, mas pra você a gente faz desconto."

I open my eyes to find a hairy-chested, fully-mustached man in fishnet stocking and a bowtie smiling at me from 
the entrance of… I wanna say a nightclub… but this is a nightclub in the same sense that a kitten is a puma ridding 
a dragon into battle. On fire.

Everyone's naked behind the mustached fishnet stockings man, and there's soap and… is that a sex swing?

God, I don't even want to know.

"Where am I?" I ask the man, trying with all my strength not to look behind him at the horrendous affair. 

"Brazil," the man replies. "This is the hottest swing club in Sao Paulo, dude."

*Wrong nightclub,* I think, pressing my eyes shut again.

You have to have the clear image in your head. That, and only that image can be in your thoughts, otherwise it 
goes wrong.

Go ask Buddhist monks how easy it is to keep your mind focused. And Buddhist monks don't have to take Adderall to be functional.

I picture the night club. The LOS ANGELES night club – the one my friends are going to. I wonder if Ethan is going 
to be there. Ethan is a nice guy. His father works at Nasa. Hey, what was that announcement Nasa made a couple 
of days –

I open my eyes and I'm in Mars.

"SHIT!"

I press my eyes closed again, trying to think of anything at all before I die from the lack of…

From the… you know, the pressure and the… oxygen…

Ok, I don't know what exactly will kill me in Mars, but I'm pretty sure something will if I don't get out of here soon. 

Just think of anything! Anything! Anywhere is better than here!

I open my eyes and I see Matt Damon in his underwear.

"Dude, what the –"

"I'm sorry!" I say, opening my hands in front of my chest in apology. Matt jumps from his couch. "I'm sorry! I had 
to think of something to get out of Mars and I guess your face was the first thing that popped in my mind, because 
of the movie, you know? I'll go soon, just give me –"

"Get out! Get out!" Matt Damon grabs a golf club and charges in my direction. Making a run for it, I press my eyes 
closed again.

*Ok, the nightclub! The nightclub! The nightclub in Hollywood! The nightclub in Hollywood! Yes, keep your mind 
focused on it! It's just like performing a Patronus spell, you have to –*

I open my eyes to the Diagon Alley Butterbeer stand at Universal Studios.

"Oh, for fuck's sake," I say, rolling my eyes.

"Hey, dude, there are kids here," a fat man walking by complains. "Mind your language."

"Fuck!" I yell, widening my eyes at him and his kids. "FUCK! FUCK! FUCKEDDY FUCKEDDY FUCK! INTERCOURSE! 
FUCK A FUCKERSON FUCKERSWEAR FUCKEDDY FUCKARD! BOOBS!"

The man sprints as I semi-chase him for a couple of steps, then stop again.

Ok, I have to calm down. I'm losing it.

Let's look at the bright side. At least I have time here. I have all the time in the world to focus.

I close my eyes. My mind is blank. Ok. Let's do it.

Not a thought. Everything is blank. Peace. Tranquility.

You know what? Screw the nightclub. I just wanna go home, now.

That's it. Home.

I picture it. My bedroom. The walls. The ceiling, the bed. The computer on the side. The books spread on the floor 
with my dirty clothes.

*Yes,* I think. *Home. Enough with this madness. Let's just go home.*

Universal Studios disappears around me, and I feel the floor vanish under my feet.

*Yes. Enough with pansexual orgies and distant planets and Matt Damon and theme parks,* I think, naturally 
picturing all of these things as I think them.

I wake up in a pansexual orgy at a Jupiter theme park with Matt Damon.

"You know what?" I think, looking around. "This one is actually pretty cool."

Matt Damon smiles.

I stared at that '2' longer than I'd stared at anything before in my entire life.

Nothing could match the beauty of that plain, grey '2'. No sunset, no mountain and no masterpiece could even compare to the emotions I felt when I saw that '2'.

There was no comment. There was no trace of who this person was. It almost didn't matter...almost.

Then I saw it. An orange envelope that filled me with hope. I clicked it like my sanity depended on it. God knows it did.

'Are you real?'

My fingers typed as I replied. The first human contact I had in 4 grueling years, 'Yes, I'm real. Who are you?'
 
'My name is Sarah. I'm a survivor.'

A girl. Another living human, and it was a woman. The hope of a new life filled my mind, and I could see it all. A home in the wreckage. A family. Children. Love. Human warmth. I could almost feel it again.

'Are there others?'

It felt like an eternity of refreshing over and over before the orange envelope was back. 'I don't know.'

'Where are you?' It was all I could ask. I had to find her. Go to her. Be with her. Be with someone. Anyone. The isolation was finally over. I could feel sorrow being washed from my soul. 

'I'm not really comfortable telling some internet stranger where I live. You could be a perv.'

I stared at those words on my screen for a long, long time before 4 words echoed through streets of desolation.

**"ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!"**

"What are you in for?" my cellmate asked.

"Grammar," I said, my eyes fixed on the wall.

"Hmm?" he said, sitting up in his bunk to hear me better. "You say something about your Grandma?"

"No," I said. "*Grammar*. The rules of composition for effective communication."

He laughed. "How did grammar get you thrown in mega-max?"

"It's fucking hard in French," I said.

"Really? I thought French and English have a lot in common."

"Well, they do, in terms of vocabulary. But there's a lot of really big differences. Especially verbs and tenses."

"Oh?"

"Yeah, for instance, they have two verbs for putting something in the past tense: *Être* and *avoir*. Some verbs take one, some take the other, some take both depending on circumstance."

"Doesn't sound like that big of a deal."

"You don't watch the news much, do you?"

"No," he said, "we're not allowed to watch it in here. The only thing I hear about the outside is through new cellmates. And my last cellmate before you kicked it about a year ago."

I laughed. "No wonder you didn't recognize me."

"So are you gonna tell me what you're really in for?"

"Depends. Are you religious?"

"Lapsed Buddhist," he said.

"Ah, that's fine. As long as you're nothing Abrahamic. Most Abrahamic people want to kill me."

"Why's that?"

"Got Jerusalem nuked. And Mecca and Medina. And Bethlehem. Lots of other places too, but those are the ones they're all pissed about."

"Oh," he said. "So *that's* what you're in for."

"Well it wasn't on purpose. It was just a mistake." I sighed. "But yeah, that's why I'm in mega-max. And why I'm in mega-max on Europa. Earth, Mars, Ceres, lots of Christians and Muslims and Jews there, so they all sort of want to kill me. People would've burnt down the prisons just to get me. The hope is that on a rock like this, where everyone's Hindu or Buddhist or whatnot, I won't get murdered too fast."

"I don't get how this can have been over a French grammar mistake," he said.

"It was, I swear. A five-word sentence."

He raised his voice slightly, annoyed. "I'm sorry. I just don't understand how you managed to fuck up a five-word sentence, offend the inhabitants of three planets and start a world war at the same time."

"Well, uh, you see... I was the secretary-general of the U.N.," I said. "I was negotiating the final terms of peace in the Middle East, and they don't love English-speakers down there, and French is the number-two international language, so we decided we'd use that. Well, the talks were at that delicate point right at the end, where it looks like smooth sailing, but there's also the highest risk of someone backing out and things going really badly."

"And...?"

"I told you. *Être* and *avoir*. You see, *messieurs-dames, nous avons tous fini* means 'ladies and gentlemen, we're all finished' in the 'done with our task' sense of the word 'finished.' *Messieurs-dames, nous* sommes *tous finis* means 'ladies and gentlemen, we're all finished' in the 'gonna die' sense of the word 'finished.' So I came out of the negotiating room to tell the crowd we'd reached an agreement, and... Well the rest is history."

"Well shit," he said.

"Yep," I said.

"Incidentally," he asked, "how did South Asia fare during the war?"

"Pretty bad. Things spiraled out from the Middle East onward, India and Japan got into a pretty big war with Pakistan and China."

"Huh. Can't have been good for Nepal," he said.

I chuckled morbidly. "God no. Whole country got nuked to Hell."

He didn't laugh back. I heard his bunk creak as he rose. "The *whole* country? Including Lumbini? Where Lord Buddha was born?!"

I gulped. "Listen, man, I told you, it was all an accident."

And then his hands were around my neck.

#### [WP] You live in a city full of people with powers (telekinesis, electro kinesis, sensors, etc) and everyone is ranked according to how powerful they but they can kill someone of higher rank and obtain their rank. You are rank #1 but no one knows what your power is

Score: 1155

You want an interview ? Fine, but you're buying the coffee. I'm getting kind of sick of this god-damned urban legend. I DON'T have superpowers, no-one has superpowers. There are just a bunch of crazy people who think they have powers, who for some reason have decided that I'm some fucked up version of their messiah.

**You don't believe super-powered people exist ?**

No. I've never seen one. I've seen the doctored footage from the media. I've seen a lot of crazy people who thought they had powers. I don't know why they gravitate to me of all people. I'm just a regular guy. I put in my hours in the office, then at the gym.

**So you haven't heard about the ranking system ?**

Oh, I've heard of their ranking system all right. That's all I ever hear. What baffles me is why they chose me to be their number one, their highest rank. That the only way for people to rise in rank and become more powerful is to kill them. Does that sound sane to you ?

Then one day, some poor bastard commits suicide near me, and suddenly, they decide that I'm the number one on their hitlist.

**You are referring to the death of the Human Jet as suicide?**

Man faceplants on the ground from a hundred feet, that's suicide. It doesn't matter that he said "Up Up and Away" before he jumped off that building. That was suicide.

**The Human Jet was one of our greatest heroes, with documented evidence of his powers..**

Blah Blah Blah. I've heard that all before. I was there, I saw him hit the ground. Where the hell do you people in the media get off encouraging these people. They are a danger to themselves.  Surely you must have learned your lesson after Inferno Man.

**Inferno Man was a criminal, whose control over fire rendered him a threat to the world...**

Bullshit. Let me tell you what happened when I met this so called inferno man. I was just hanging out in a cafe not far from here, when this asshole shows up in a stupid costume. He bursts in, and gives this long speech about how he's going to kill me and burn everything down.

Then nothing happened. He stood there for like five minutes, straining, and glaring at me. I don't know what I did, I just wanted my cup 'o' joe. Then he leaves, and I thought "That was weird, I'm glad it's over".

Then he comes back, with a barrel of gasoline. Who the fuck would sell him gasoline. that's beside the point. The point is that the fucker doused himself in the stuff, and then pulled out a lighter and set himself on fire. Right in front of me. Hearing him scream almost put me off my coffee.

**Yes, quite a lot of superpowered villains have died under similar mysterious circumstances in your presence**

If by superpowered people, you mean insane people, then yes. The numbers of clowns in capes who drop out of the sky near me is so bloody annoying. Not to mention the scrawny fucks who just straight up try to pick fights with me.
Oh god, there was one which was genuinely funny. 

This guy came up to me with this long speech about how he is one with nature, and that he will use all of his power to destroy me. I don't know why these guys always gotta speech at me. When I punch someone, I punch'em, I don't tell 'em my life story.
He had this tiger with him. Big fucking cat. He told the tiger to get me. Moment the muzzle was off, it savaged him. I fucking split my sides.

**So you don't think you have any superpowers at all ?**

Course not. Like I said *nobody* has superpowers. At least not that I've seen, not when they're around me.

"Philadelphia", the old man whispers in my ear, just as I open the headline on /r/news.

"What?" Is what I ask, looking from the words in front of me (New York bound United Airlines Flight Disappearance 
- Live Coverage) to the man on the seat behind me. He is smiling, looking straight ahead at his little Adam Sandler movie on my headrest. He doesn't seem to acknowledge me at all.

I shrug, and I look back at the article.

*Flight 6674 of United Airlines, from Paris to New York, has been missing since 2:46 PM East Coast Time this Monday. Radio  communications have been down for at least two hours, and the tower has been unable to communicate with any crew aboard the flight. The aircraft started deviating from its course at about 1:13 PM, heading south into the --*

The article goes on, explaining exactly how it was that the plane I was taking now had disappeared and was missing from every radar in the world. I scratch my head.

"Philadelphia", I hear, in my ear again. Again I turn back. And the man is asleep, now.

"Excuse me", I say, to a passing by flight attendant. "Are we experiencing anything unusual?"

"What do you mean, sir?"

"Are we changing course? Avoiding a storm, or something?"

"Not that I am aware of, sir."

She's smiling in a funny way. Looking straight into my eyes, like she means the exact opposite of what a smile 
usually means.

"I'm talking about this", I say, and I'm about to turn my laptop towards her and show her the article when I notice 
her mouth. She's not smiling anymore.

She's mouthing the words "Shut up" in silence. Her eyes are locked on mine.

Then a second goes by and she's smiling again, and she keeps pulling her cart down the aisle like nothing has happened.

I look at the screen and the article now reads "Five Things You Had no Idea The Kardashians Are Up To."

I frown and I open Google. I search for 'Flight 6674'. Nothing. It's following its scheduled course, according to 
United Airlines website.

"You mean to tell me you never heard of the Philadelphia Experiment?" I hear, again from behind me.

I turn around. "Look, sir, I --"

I shut up. The old man is not an old man anymore. He's young -- easily thirty years younger. But he looks the 
same. Same eye color. Same face proportions. Same body and same clothes.

"The USS Eldridge", the young man says, smiling like I'm a child. "October 28, 1943."

"What?"

He shakes his head, then goes back to closing his eyes and resting his head.

I frown. I feel dizzy and lightheaded. I look around. 

Thepeople around me carry on their affairs as usual, but it's... 

There's something. 

Something off about them.

The man listening to music. I follow the wire down his chest. The headphone doesn't seem to be connected to anything.

And wasn't the child by the fat woman's side a boy?

Wasn't the male flight attendant blonde? His hair is black now, as he rushes past the aisle and disappears towards first class.

An old lady looks straight at me from a couple of sits back, and she's scribbling something on a notepad on her lap.

The tall guy sleeping next to me. I check his wristwatch. The arrows are frozen at 1:13.

"Ladies and gentlemen please prepare for descent in the JFK airport. Fasten seat belts and please raise your seats to upright position."

I look out the window.

Gleaming beautifully against the afternoon sun are two tall, twin buildings, the way I remembered them from my 
childhood. Twin buildings tall reaching the sky the way I remember them being before September, 2001.

*This can't be*, I think, turning my head to face my laptop screen.

I try searching for "USS Eldridge. Philadelphia Experiment."

No internet connection.

"When we land", the young man-used-to-be-old man behind me whispers, in my ear. "Walk with me."

#### [WP] A sign on Mars is found that reads: "Level 2" and is signed by God.

Score: 1152

"Metroidvania..." I mumble.

"What?" Gerard calls back into my mic.

I turn, laboriously, until my spacesuit-clad body is facing the man. He's still staring at the sight before us, no doubt still bug-eyed. Fine Martian silt billowed around our boots, disturbed by our awkward footsteps, and it moved like an ominous and rusty cloud. The stars were out, just barely, and just barely I could see it, out on the horizon, glowing brighter as the sun fell behind a mountain in the distance: a pale blue dot, glinting like a ruddy stone in the distant sky, so far away that a guy couldn't help but feel uneasy. It was quite literally levels beyond us.

"You ever play video games?" I ask.

"I... uh... for God's sake: you're actually talking video games now? What about *this*?"

He motions before us with a clumsy arm, gesticulating wildly at the narrow, elegant sign resting sedately in the rocky soil. Clear letters set into the plaque spell out two haunting words. I read them in English. Gerard read them in French.

Back at mission control, everyone seemed to read them in the language they grew up with.

Neat trick, I guess.

"Level *two*..." I shake my head, struggling not to grin. But I do. 

I always do that, when I'm disappointed.

Gerard is already talking about logical explanations: bad air in our suits, or mass hallucinations back at mission control, or maybe some elaborate hoax. About that last one he might even been right. There *was* a joke going on here.

I'm afraid it's on us.

"Quiet down, Gerard," I say. "It's no big deal-"

"*No big deal*?" The man screams into my earpiece. "Are you insane-"

I shake my head, not easy to do in the clunky suit, and I shrug:

"No. Just a little disappointed."

"*Disappoi*-" the man's words cut out, so livid is he with my nonchalance. "This is the greatest discovery in the history of... of... *history*."

Again I beam a wan, shit-eating little smile.

"It's pretty neat," I mumble, "but I'm afraid that isn't the case." I rest one hand on Gerard's shoulder, and I draw a slow breath. "You remember my buddy in Alaska? Johnny?"

Gerard can't even form a rational answer to my tangent, and so I merely speak on:

"Ol' Johnny's more a drunk than anything, and he's known to tell his tall tales. It's from the life he lives, I guess. Crab fishing ain't easy, I'll give him that. And so, when he's knocking back his scotch and tells me about one of the hauls his crew made off the Aleutians, well..." I chuckle. "It's just 'crazy old Johnny', I think. But, now..." I shake my head, scoffing.

"What're you talking about?" Gerard grumbles. "What'd *he* manage to find, that could rival this?"

"He says he once had a cage sink much deeper than usual- nearly exhausted their lines letting it fall- and when they managed to haul it back in they had a strange object tangled up with the catch- heavy thing- and it fell back into the brine as soon as the cage came out of the water."

I cock my head at the plaque before us and shrug:

"Sometimes the next steps aren't where you think they are, Gerard. We're good and well, moving along up here, but the greatest finds in history might be in some unexpected places. See, ol' Johnny had found a plaque, and it was identical to this one-"

"Wh- *what*? Identical?"

I nod, but then I slowly shake my head:

"Well, but for one thing." I look at Gerard, and again that sad little smile hits my lips. "His said 'Level *three*'."

#### [WP] 70 years ago, the US underestimated the power of the atomic bomb. It had completely obliterated the island nation of Japan.

Score: 1151

The paint can hissed in my hand as I worked in the darkness. "Equality cannot be bombed," I scrawled in red across the side of the Kuomintang military headquarters of Shenyang. We had to let the people know that the Party was still alive and active. That we were organizing, and preparing. Getting ready for the day when we'd overthrow the KMT. They needed some reminder, because morale was at an all-time low after Mao's surrender. 

I can't fault him; it would be suicide to continue fighting against the threat of an atomic holocaust. I'll always remember where I was that day: August 6, 1945. "The day the sun came to Earth," as we called it. The bright flash of light blinded and deafened many even hundreds of miles away, and a vast cloud of poison stretched over China's heartland for months. America had dropped a new type of bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, so powerful that the devastation stretched from Okinawa to the far tip of Honshu. Only Hokkaido and some of the far-outlying islands managed to survive the initial blast, but were still devastated by the ensuing radioactive fallout. Most of Japan had been turned to rubble and swallowed by the sea, and the few remaining shards of mountains were desolate and charred.

At first, we cheered. Despite the devastation that the bomb had wrought, ten years of war were ended in one fell swoop with almost no Allied soldiers lost. The southern half of the Korean peninsula had been part of Japan for so long that it wouldn't be missed either. The few Japanese troops scattered throughout China laid down arms immediately after hearing the news. It seemed as though all of our dreams had come true. But with Japan vanquished, the KMT turned their eyes to Manchuria, heart of the Communist party. And Chiang Kai-shek had America's might at his back.

Many doubted whether the bomb would ever be used again. Japan had been a unique situation; the entire island was ready to die for their cause, and retaking it with conventional means would have been a meatgrinder. But Manchuria was full of civilians; they wouldn't kill them without good reason, would they? And we hadn't attacked America like the Japanese had. Was America so bloodthirsty that it would murder millions just to keep Chiang in power?

Those questions dissipated when Moscow and Leningrad were destroyed. The American broadcasts claimed that the Soviet Union had developed a similar weapon in the space of only two years, and that they were preparing to use it against the cities on the East Coast of America. "We could not afford to wait until their final preparations were completed," the American president had said. Everyone in my village clustered around the radio, listening to the address. Jing, who had been imprisoned with some of the American soldiers, translated for us. The USSR surrendered as soon as the utterly decapitated government struggled to regroup. The President' message ended with a warning: any means necessary will be used to defeat the evils of Communism. *Any means necessary*. 

Chairman Mao got the message and surrendered himself to KMT custody later that day. His final orders were for the rest of us to lay down arms lest Manchuria be reduced to another crater like our former allies. And that was the end, as far as the KMT knows.

Few of us continue the fight in whatever way we can. No weapons or bullets, just ideas. Ideas sprayed in red paint, letting the people know that this isn't over.

Score: 1150

"I don't know, man, I'm starting to think we've gone too deep. I never shoulda sold the VW to finance this shit."

"Hey man, I had to sell shit too. I'm not gonna accept failure on this. There's no going back now, we'll just have to find another investor."

The two twenty-something-year-old men were sitting in the garage that was their office, laboratory, and company headquarters. As they often had during the past few months, they were arguing over their company's success -- or, as it were, the company's lack of success. One man was skinny, the other large, but both had a general air of nerdiness about them. The skinny nerd, who was the first speaker, replied:

"I've already tried, remember? Asshole bailed on us after about two weeks. I'm telling you, I'm starting to lo-"

All of a sudden, he was interruped by a man who had walked up to the open door of the garage. 

"Hellooooo fellow 1990s-ers! I've traveled from far in the f-- er -- far from Finland to meet you!"

The man was wearing a plaid button-down shirt and corduroy pants. Perched atop his nose was a pair of thick-rimmed square glasses. He had a strange air about him, to say the least. But he had no Finnish accent, or any other accent the two men in the garage could recognize. After pausing to think for a moment, he continued:

"Yep, that's me! I'm a Finnish investor who's heard about your little company and I want to make an invest--"

As he'd started the sentence, a much stranger man had approached the garage. This one was dressed in a sort of furry jumpsuit, and he interrupted the first man just as the latter had done to the two inventors' conversation.

"Please! Did you think of that little speech on your way over on the ti- uhh, the plane? Real smooth, Trump, but I guess your family never had the most braincells."

"Fuck off, Rockefeller, this is my deal! And you look fucking ridiculous here in that UggsOnesie, you could have at least *tried* to put on a costume for the period --"

"If you weren't here fucking things up, no one would even have cared what I was wearing by the end of the conversation. You don't even know how to talk to people from your own time, let alone --"

"A *Rockefeller* telling a *Trump* he's no good with people?! Oh, that's rich! At least I was a self-made man before I started going back in time to make money for my ancestors, not like anyone alive today in your two-bit family, you people just can't face your declining fortunes. . ."

The two nerdy-looking inventors had stared at the time travelers with increasing bafflement as the conversation unfolded. Now, they glanced at eachother, seeming to come to an understanding. The larger one spoke up, adding a final interruption to the mix:

"Uh, guys, we're uh, really glad you want to invest in our company. But we're pretty sure that we're not going forward with this project."

With a *pop*, Trump and Rockeller disappeared, leaving only an empty expanse of driveway behind.

#### [WP] A little girl suspects that there's something not quite right about herself. Her parents enthusiastically tell her she's normal. But her brother whispers, "It really isn't normal to have to be plugged into a wall charger at night."

Score: 1147

Chrissy always knew that she was a little different, though she couldn’t quite put her finger on it. Maybe it was the oily liquid she had for dinner while Mommy, Daddy, and Jason ate solid foods. Maybe it was how she always had to go to that funny building with funny smelling people who wanted to fix her. Or maybe it was the things other Mommies said when they spoke over her, like they thought she couldn’t hear.

“I just don’t want to have to explain it to my Brittini,” one would say.

“We do normal child activities, and I’m sure it would be too rough on Chrissy,” said another.

“I want my kids to have friends that they can grow up with.”

Mommy slapped the other mother for that one. She bought Chrissy an ice cream cone, which prompted another visit to the funny building to get fixed. Mommy said she was sorry, and it was back to the oily liquid.

Jason didn’t talk to her much. Chrissy thought that Jason didn’t like her. She asked him one day if she was normal.

"It really isn't normal to have to be plugged into a wall charger at night," he’d said.

That night, when she went to sleep, she stopped Mommy as she bent to push buttons on the funny machine.

“Mommy, do I have to be plugged in?” she asked.

“I know it’s uncomfortable, but yes,” she said.

“I want to be normal,” Chrissy said. “Please don’t plug me in.”

“I have to,” said Mommy.

Chrissy sighed and pulled at the wires and tubes.

“It’s because of the terminal canceo-canceono, the terminal thing?” Chrissy asked. It’s what all the people who wanted to fix her talked about, but Chrissy couldn’t quite remember the name. It was one of those extra long ones that made her tongue feel clumsy in her mouth.

Mommy stopped.

“Yes,” she said quietly.

“Okay,” Chrissy sighed. “I wish I was like other kids.”

“I’m sorry. I love you.”

“I love you too, Mommy. Goodnight.”

Edit: Thank you for the gold and comments! This blew up a bit overnight, so I'll add that there's a small "secret ending" implied in this story, but I decided not to say it explicitly.

Police Record of [REDACTED]'s Journal Following Incident [REDACTED]

08/22/20xx

Today I saw somebody die for the first time. Right in front of me. He handed me this...credit card...before blowing his brains out. I was just walking home from work like normal. I'm not sure what to do or who to tell. When the police showed up it was like they didn't notice me. They didn't take a statement, or my name, or anything. I offered and they just let me go. I don't know how to handle this. I'd schedule an appointment with my therapist but I don't think she'd believe me. I fear I'm losing my grip on reality I...*words scratched out*

The weirdest thing about this is that the card has my name on it. I mean, it didn't when he gave it to me but it changed. I know this doesn't make any sense. Hopefully I can make sense of all of this. I'll keep this record updated but I don't intend to use the card at all. I'll just hang on to it just in case. 

***Note: Most of the next week passes with little mention of the card, as though the person in question is trying to forget or actively not mentioning it. Picking up at the next relevant date***

8/28/20xx

I was reading back to my earlier entries and noticed mention of a credit card and somebody dying. I...I don't remember that happening but I also don't recognize this card in my wallet. It feels like it's always been there. I used it to pay for my coffee today without realizing I didn't recognize it at first. Journal, I really feel like I've lost it this time. My medication isn't helping with this. I need to lie down. I'll update again after I've had time to think.

I called the number on the back of the card to verify my account. See when I opened it. See the gaps in my memory I'm missing. Did it as soon as I woke up. Do you remember dial-up? That horrible noise from when we were growing up together? That's all I heard screeching back at me. There's no website to try on the card. Hell, there isn't even a "Visa" or "MasterCard" logo or anything like that. Gonna try using it online and see what happens.

I just bought a new laptop. It worked. We'll see when it gets here. I really wish I knew what was going on. 

***Note: Another return to normalcy until the laptop shows up 3 days later.***

The laptop showed up today. I don't remember ordering it but here it is. It's like whenever I try to think about the card it slips my mind. Whenever I use it it eats at me. Is that the price? Is that why he died? Is it eating my soul? Why did he give it to me? I called my therapist and mentioned the card. Said I needed new medication and I didn't know what was happening. I go in in a couple days. 

Laptop works great. 

***Note: Daily updates stop here. Aside from a few distorted drawings and a short, irrelevant poem the journal does not update until the next full posting. This is different than anytime in the journals record which goes back [REDACTED] years updating daily***

"My name is not John"

The room was silent but for the shuffling of papers on the table of a man seated in front of him.

The shuffler stood and adjusted his tie, "John, I, unlike my counterpart here," he pointed to a sweating man on his right, "don't want to waste anybody's  time here. So, I'm only gonna ask you three questions okay?"

"Sure" replied John calmly.

"Those pens you mentioned before, you know you got the colours wrong yes"

"You lying sonuvabitch, you killed my baby!" She howled and moved to jump the partition separating them. The bailiff moved to hold her back and the judge slammed his gavel.

#### [EU] Tell the tale of Vault 69, which had 999 women and one man. Alternatively, tell the tale of Vault 68, which had 999 men and one woman.

Score: 1141

He hated living in Vault 69, absolutely hated it. Sure, Don had to admit that the idea of being the only man in a vault full of women sounded incredible on paper, but that definitely wasn't the case. Don was currently in his tiny, windowless office that unfortunately doubled as his living quarters. Most of the other members of the vault shared living space, but he was isolated.    

Don stuck is head out of the door, as though he were a worm checking for any early birds. A small cluster of older women walked by and smiled at him but otherwise it appeared that no one was planning on making a trip to see him. As much as Don hated the isolation, that made him happy. He mostly hung out with the older women in the vault whenever he bothered to venture around, as they practically raised him. The younger women in the vault weren't too bad in all honesty, but he normally would be put in some rather awkward positions whenever that happened.    

"Hey Don!" A bubbly blonde that Don knew as Anna shouted, a split second before Don stuck his head back into his office. Anna was, like half of the other females within the vault, a lesbian. She always treated Don kindly though, and so Don was rather fond of her. Still, he wasn't about to draw attention to himself by having a conversation with her. He smiled at her and continued his retreat into his office. Don fiddled with his Pip-Boy, hoping that time would quickly pass and his office hours would end without a single visitor. That hope went out the window when he saw someone poke their head in.    

"I'm in need of your services, Don." The brunette spoke, shutting the door behind her as she came in. The brunette was another person that Don recognized, but he couldn't remember her name. It didn't really matter, in all honesty. She walked over to his desk and scattered a few caps on the top of it. Don didn't even bother to count them; it was always enough. This was the reason Don hated the vault. This job, that he was forced to take. Don was the official baby maker within the vault. Whenever a woman decided that she wanted to have a child, Don had to provide his sperm. They always birthed females, much to his disappointment. The females fourteen and under were all his daughters within this vault, although he didn't have much attachment to them. But soon, they would want children and that was something Don refused to do.    

"Drop your pants and bend over on the desk. You get three sessions: one today, one next week, and one the week after that. After those three sessions, if impregnation doesn't take place then you will have to pay again." Don spoke in a bored, nearly monotone voice. The brunette wasn't particularly attractive to Don, but he had definitely been with a lot worse, and a lot older. Besides, this wasn't exactly pleasure for him. It was business.    

"Oh thank you, oh thank you!" The brunette managed to spit out in between moans. Don ignored her, and continued to pump away. He longed to escape this vault and see the world, or what was left of it. Maybe he'd die from the radiation on the surface. Anything was better than this. He finished up, and the woman ran out the office. There was no passion, no romance, no kissing involved. Some of his clients weren't even into him, and insisted on their partners being present to make sure he didn't enjoy himself too much. Like he was some fucking animal performing circus acts.    

"Fucking hell." Don pushed the bottle caps into his growing collection as he heard a knock on his office door. Much to his delight however, the woman who entered was already pregnant.    

"I wanted you to be the first to know Don, that you finally did it. I'm having a boy!" Sera, one of his clients from a few months back announced. Don sat there for a moment; his hands resting in the pockets of his blue jumpsuit and his face twisted in shock. Then, he laughed. He laughed hard and it continued as though a hyena had finally become unhinged. Still laughing, Don got up and walked over to Sera. He dropped to his knees, his laughing fit now silenced, and stuck his head close to her stomach.   

"Welcome to Vault 69; the most fucked up place in the world." Don grinned as he spoke, his successor finally appearing.

“They let you out?” Karal laughed.

I gave her a weird look. “What are you talking about?”

Karal leaned back and gave me a weird look. “Are your people still keeping you in the dark?”

I rubbed my eyes. Karal came from the planet Hormon. Karal’s culture heritage on Hormon led to discussions that often times beat around the bush. The idea was that it led to deeper conversation. Right now it was just annoying. “Just get to the point, Karal.”

Her feathers fluffed in annoyance. “Earth was known as the Hermit Kingdom.”

I cocked an eyebrow. “What?”

“Your leaders kept you in the dark. We routinely contacted and tried to visit Earth. Your planet was very high up on the list for uplifting about two-hundred years ago.”

“No.” I shook my head. “No.”

“Your leaders wanted to stay in power. They didn’t want to give it up to the Council.”

“What proof do you have?”

Karal brought up a plethora of news stories in the air between us. She reached up and scrolled through the thousands and thousands. She brushed a couple over my way. “Here a few for you.”

I started to read through them. The Tunguska Event was a crashed info probe. Roswell was a broken down envoy. The Moon Landing created waves through the galactic community. Earth’s first colony on Mars created a tsunami.

“All first world leaders were contacted at some point. All of them brushed us off,” said Karal. “Everyone was very disappointed.”

I scratched my head. “So you’re saying we stayed isolated and a technological backwater because our leaders wanted to stay in power?”

Karal nodded. “Yep. The Hermit Kingdom’s walls only broke down once we littered your airwaves with our message. We took it directly to the people.”

“You’re telling me the galactic community took a door-to-door approach and that broke down the barriers?”

“Basically.”

I leaned back in my chair and looked around. That wasn’t how it had been taught to me. At the same time, no one who had seen the First Contact event firsthand was alive anymore. “I’ve never heard it that way before.”

Karal smirked. “The Hermit Kingdom is still alive.”

#### [WP][EU] You are a waterbending Pokemon trainer from Tattooine. Your best friends, a Predator and Groot, have been kidnapped by the Borg and are being kept on Krypton. How will you get past the ice ninjas to save the galaxy from Trogdor?

Score: 1139

I sat cross-legged in front of the moisture separator as the harsh, gritty winds of Tattooine swirled around me. With deep concentration, I willed the molecules out of the air and into the separator until the steady drip of water reached my ears. It took at least two hours of concentration, but the cannister was finally full.

"Come on, Sandshrew!" I called to my little Pokemon companion, who had burrowed under the dunes for a quick nap while I worked. We'd been best friends for the past ten years, after he saved me from a Zubat swarm under Mt. Doom. I *hate* zubats; they're my greatest fear. Sandshrew burst forth and shook himself off, then noticed that I was already loading the jug into the back. He galloped toward my Delorean for the ride into town and perched himself right in the passenger seat. Sticking his head out the window of the speeding car was probably his favorite activity. "Not yet, little buddy. Gotta let the parents know that we're leaving." 

I ducked my head inside the domed little house near the moisture farm. My parents, Martha and Thomas Wayne, were each inside doing their work. "Jug's full," I told them. "I'm going into town to sell it, and then maybe meeting up with Groot and Predator for a drink at the Cantina. Is that all right?"

Dad nodded. "Just be back in time for supper, son."

"You got it." I hurried back outside and leaped into the driver seat, and immediately rolled down the window for Sandshrew. I floored it, going faster than I've ever gone: 87 miles per hour this time! We made it to the nearby city of Columbia in no time!

But the city was utterly in ruins. Most of the hovering platforms had crashed into the sandy dunes and were burning or already destroyed. Tattered American flags littered the desert. Those few buildings that remained were having difficulty staying aloft. The closest building to me was the museum; Sandshrew and I rushed inside.

"Professor Jones! What happened??" The old archaelogist was pinned in the remains of the museum, surrounded by empty glasses cases that had been full of items he rescued from sites all over the world. 

"There was... a ship..." he managed to gasp as I struggled to free him. "A massive cube. Their leader called himself a 'Borg.' Destroyed the whole town, and stole all of my pieces." He gestured to the empty glass case around him. 

"Don't worry, Professor." I couldn't get him out from under the wreckage. Even Sandshrew was trying to help, desperately digging around the sides of it. "I'll get them back. Predator, Groot and I can go track down this 'Borg.'"

He shook his head, causing his hat to fall off. He was having difficulty keeping his eyes open. "It took them," he said. "Along with the other members of the Council: Iron Man, the Lone Wanderer, and the Dragonborn... and...." his voice trailed off.

"No, Professor!" I shook him back awake. "Don't die on me!"

"They said something about... games. Hunger Games... of our greatest heroes..." he gave a feeble cough. "And they were coming for you next." He gave a final sigh, and fell to the side, dead. 

Sandshrew gave a sad chirp, then looked back at me with fear in his eyes.

"Coming for me next..." I said. "That means that they'll be heading to the farm! We've got to go save Mom and Dad! What would happen to me if I became an orphan??"

We rushed back to the Delorean and sped back home just as fast as we'd come. But I could already see the smoke on the horizon. Sandshrew gave a sad cry and curled up in my lap as the car slowed down on approach. The dome of the house was collapsed inward, and everything that *could* burn was on fire. And this 'Borg' was nowhere to be seen. 

I rushed inside, hoping beyond hope that *maybe* they had survived the attack. I could still save them with my waterbending! But I found their scorched skeletons clutching each other, far beyond hope. And I collapsed in the middle of the ruins, racked with sobs.

"Well, well," A sinister voice gloated from behind me. "Looks like Trogdor was right to leave me behind after burninating this place to the ground. You *did* come back after all." I managed to get to my knees and turn around. A man clad in armor made entirely of ice stood in the doorway, holding a crystal clear sword. 

"Why?" I cried out to him. "What did they ever do to you?"

The ice ninja approached with a hauty grin. "It's not what they did," he answered. "It's what *you* *will* do in the future!"

"The future? How could you know..."

Before he could answer, he was riddled with bullets and fell flat on the floor of the still-burning ruins of my home. Whatever enchantment had held his armor together was broken, and the shards of ice began to melt into the sand. A second figure stepped through the doorway, wearing a leather jacket and dark sunglasses. The barrel of his minigun was still whirring and smoking. 

"We've got to save your friends," the mysterious figure said. "There will be more ninjas coming soon."

I struggled to my feet. "Who are you?"

"Cyberdyne Systems model 101. A 'Terminator'" he answered. "Sent back in time to eliminate Trogdor. And I need your help."

"Why me?" This was all too much to process.

The Terminator clapped a strong hand on my shoulder. "Because... yer a wizard, Harry."

Score: 1139

"Well," I say, trying to ease some of the tension from my throne room. "This is awkward."

The room's heavy with that kind of silence that comes after big revelations. You probably know the sort I'm on about. Not a regular silence, not by a long shot. 

There's a loose semi-circle of horrid, twisted creatures that have followed me in my war against the Devil himself. My troops. Their eyes are flitting between me, sat on the Throne of the Damned, and the angelic envoy sent by the Creator, who's bowed before me.

His impeccably tied and excessively clean white toga is cast in a dark crimson glow in the low light of my palace. His pure blue aura overshadowed by the black-and-red corruption stemming from all around him. 

In the silence you can hear every scream, every cry of pain, coming from the outside world.

It's the Throne's previous occupier and his biggest, baddest Generals making all the noise. Once he bent his knee to me, handed me the crown and the keys to the kingdom, I had him and his buddies impaled outside m front door. That was the better part of a month ago, and they're still out there, slowly dying.

"I assure you, the Lord God agrees with you." The Angel replies. "But you can read it yourself - here - it's a Royal Pardon. An admittance to Heaven."

"That's sort of weird, don't you think?" I ask. "I mean, I've been here less than half a year and Lucifer's gone. His Generals are dead or dying. I've purged Hell of the weak, the old and the sick."

"You don't have to remind me." The Angel frowns. "I am well aware of your exploits."

"Well apparently not, if you're letting me back through the Pearly Gates." I laugh, and then snap my fingers in the general direction of the creature to the left of my Throne. He darts out the room through a door nearby, and returns soon after with a goblet and a pitcher of wine.

'Wine' is a little generous. It tastes like what you'd get if you mixed kerosene and the tears of orphans. Still, it's all I have to drink. And drink I do, downing the goblet in a matter of seconds. I hand my servant the goblet back and wipe my mouth with the back of my hand.

"It's not my choice to make. I'm just - "

"Hang on," I cut off the Angel with a raised palm, and point at one of my guards. He snaps to attention under my gaze, shaking a little bit. Makes me feel a little bit of glee when he does. He's more than twice the size of me. Saw him rip a man apart with his bare hands once. "You! Put on some music. Something classic. A little AC/DC, maybe."

He scampers off to do my bidding. Don't think I'll ever tire of that. 

"As I was saying." The Angel says, his face tripping him even more than before. "The Lord God requires your answer immediately."

It's not too long before the opening riff to *Back in Black* echoes throughout my palace, and I'll be honest I tune out of the Angel's spiel as he goes on about his Holy Master being very forgiving. I'm too busy listening to the music.

My Steward, Pez, has to tap me on the shoulder to break me out of the hold that Brian Johnson's vocals have over me.  'Pez' isn't his real name. His real is *Pez'Rinkl Van'HurdenShenktNurgal*, but I can't pronounce that, so Pez it is. 

He's an impossibly tall thing, with long purple limbs and a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth. He's got the sort of voice you can only really get from a lifetime of smoking unfiltered cigarettes and slinging drinks in a seedy Vegas nightclub. To hear him, you can't hep but think of a rusty hinge, or a steaming kettle. To see him, well, you just know he's someone who could turn your life upside down in an instant. 

"Your Grace." Says Pez, arching something that could be an eyebrow.

"Hmm?" I reply, clicking my fingers to the rhythmic hammering of the drums.

"The Envoy. He requires your answer." Pez says.

"Ah. Of course. Grand." I say, turning my attention back to the Angel at the foot of the raised dais my Throne sits on. I study him for a few seconds. A few seconds turns to a few minutes. Silence again. More screams in the distance are audible. My armies are still out there, reveling in the spoils of victory.

"You don't remember the question, do you?" Pez breaks the silence.

"Not a bit." I reply, with a shrug.

"Oh for the love of all that's Holy!" Thunders the Angel. "It's a very simple question, *Your Grace.* Do you accept the Lord God's Royal Pardon or not?"

"No."

"Good, then let's you and I leave this...Hang on. What?" The Angel's jaw drops, practically all the way to the floor. His eyes are wide, incredulous. "Did you...Did you just refuse?"

"I did."

"Well...Well...*Why?!*"

I cast my eye around my Throne Room. Scan the faces of the guards and the Nobility of Hell come to offer me their allegiance. There's a line of them at the door. I'm making them wait, because I can.

"I rather like it here." I reply, holding one hand up to my face and examining my finger nails. "There's hedonistic pleasure to be had. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Heaven's a lovey place, but I like sex. And drinking. And smoking. And rock music. And fun."

"You will rue this decision, fiend!" The Angel snaps. "When the Lord God hears of your defiance, he *will* strike you down!"

I sigh, shoot a side-long glance at Pez that says *I told you so*, and then nod to a few of my guards. They move in before the Angel has a chance to clock what's going on.

He gives a strangled cry as he's forced to his knees by one, and the other touches an ugly-looking blade to his throat. He's being held in place by his long silver hair and the shoulder of his toga. 

"Cut his throat. Stuff the pardon in his mouth." I bark the order at them. AC/DC's still going in the background.

"No! Please! Wait!" Pleads the Angel. I let him beg.

"Pez, you know a sorcerer that can whip up a spell to keep his head alive even when...Y'know...*'seperated'* from his body?" I ask.

"Of course, Sire." My Steward nods. "I'll send for her straight away." Then he's gone from the room.

"Brilliant." I clap my hands together, then shoot a little grin the Angel's way. His eyes are bulging, the veins on his neck and forehead clear as day. "You can take my letter of Pardon back where it came from, Angel. And be very sure to not leave out any details of our meeting. We wouldn't want God misunderstanding and sending down another one of you poor buggers, would we?"

I order the Angel taken away, down in one of the Black Cells will do it. A few hours of total sensory deprivation will ensure he's sharp for his meeting with my sorcerer. I watch him as he's dragged away. As he kicks and struggles and then eventually, when he's a little more than halfway to the exit, go limp and let it happen. Maybe I should feel bad. But then, beheading a man and keeping him alive afterwards doesn't even come close to being the worst thing I've done this week.

"May I ask, Your Grace, how you came to die?" Asks Pez when he's back in the room, ready for the next petitioner.

"I was shanked in prison, Pez." I reply.

"Ah. And may I ask why you were in prison?"

"Pirated a copy of Disney's *Cars 2*." I say it through gritted teeth."Wasn't even a good film."

Ms. Walker sat perched on the rim of her desk and looked out over the class with a welcoming smile. Her chestnut hair was done up in a bouncy ponytail, as usual. "All right, students," she called out. "Who didn't do the reading from last night?" She opened up the class this way every day so that she knew who to focus on most to get him or her up to speed. 

Only one student raised his hand: Erik Miller, sitting in the far back corner like he could hide from the teacher's sight there. The other students snickered and snuck judgmental glances over their shoulders in a very obvious way.

"Erik, join me here at the front of the class for a moment." She gestured to her desk, and the unavoidable "ooooh"s and whispers from the class began almost immediately. Erik clambered out of his desk, making as much noise as possible, and stomped up the row. 

"How many times is that this month?" Ms Walker whispered.

"Four," he replied sullenly, avoiding eye contact.

She shook her head softly. "And what was it this time?" She was almost afraid to ask, knowing what the answer was without him confirming it. But, she was required to get the statement from him before escalating the situation.

"I left my backpack in the living room," he said slowly, looking back to see which classmates were laughing hardest. Possibly picking a target to fight later in the day, which was his way of getting back at them. "My mom and dad were fighting in there and I didn't want to go in past them to get it."

Ms. Walker already had the note and hall pass written out to send him back to the school counselor. She'd been expecting this to occur for a number of days. Everyone had, really. She ushered him out the door with a helpless expression, then phoned into the counselor's office and informed him that Erik would be arriving soon.

"Sorry to see you again," Mr. Powell told Erik, who was slumped in the comfortable seat. Erik just nodded in response. "Well, why don't you tell me what happened?" He clicked his pen and prepared to fill out the appropriate reporting form. "Was your father drinking again?"

Erik nodded once more. Mr. Powell had already checked the box in anticipation of that answer. Erik's father, Donald Miller, had a reputation around town. A well-earned one, as the many bruises he'd dished out over the years could attest to. He was an angry drunk, and had been since high school. The fact that he managed to keep it contained nowadays until he was behind closed doors didn't mean much, though: there were still witnesses. Primarily Erik, now that his poor mother rarely left the house.

"What were they arguing about?" This section of the form was often different. Sometimes money, sometimes work, sometimes....

"Mom is cheating on Dad," Erik answered. "Having an affair with the neighbor. He asked her why she hadn't washed his work clothes, and she said she was out of the house. That really set him off, and then..." Erik's voice was choked up, and his eyes were watering. But, as with most teenage boys, he did his best to fight off the tears. "Then he asked *where* she'd gone... and she told him."

Mr. Powell wrote that onto the form. Everything had to be properly recorded. "I'm sorry to hear that, Erik. I've known your father since high school, and he's always had this temper. Your mother, though, is a fine woman. Pity what's happened."

Erik had no response to that. 

"And did he beat her?" Mr. Powell continued.

Erik nodded. The tears couldn't be stopped now. They rolled down his red cheeks in dribbling streams.

"I see." Mr. Powell checked the corresponding box. 

"Will he be arrested?" Erik asked. 

Mr. Powell nodded. "Definitely. This is the fifth first-hand report of his abuse. Even though your mother will refuse to press charges, the prosecutors can now take matters into their own hands. He'll be questioned in front of a judge, who will then sentence him to a prison term."

Erik stared down at his shoes. "Good," he finally said.

#### [WP] The last person on Earth is essentially turning off the lights before they leave.

Score: 1138

The meal was awful. It was some kind of old military rations that the servitors had delivered - still dusty from the stores.  
Leo mouthed it woodenly, barely tasting the food, interspersing it with sips of filtered water.  
*Your last meal*, she thought, *did you ever think you'd be aware of it?*  
Of course not. Most last meals in the past were eaten unaware; the person falling victim to an accident or trauma.  
She finished the ancient rations and put them into the disposal chute where the garbage rattled off, to be converted to pure energy by molecular inductors.  
The final shutdown was progressing apace; faster than predicted. Her presence here was a formality - just a human eye to watch over the machines as they recycled the remnants of humanity's legacy on the planet. They'd shut down the old power grids and ripped up the endless pylons - strong robotic hands disposing of the unwanted materials. Next had been the cities; taken down building by building, intelligent bots breaking down the rubble into useful elements for the Mainframe.  
With humanity gone, the machines could work without worry of health or safety. They bulldozed swathes of land, stripping it of all artificial constructions. Irradiated, filled with toxic chemicals, nothing would grow for generations, but at least now the land had a chance.  
Leo checked the readouts on the massive wall in front of her. The pathetically inadequate synapses in her organic mind couldn't sort through all of it and the machines spoonfed her important facts on a dumbed-down terminal to compensate.  
She'd hoped the meal would taste better, that her final terrestrial memory would be a human one, an *organic* one. If there had been someone left to have sex with, she might have gone down that route, but food was really the last pleasure left to her.  
The uplink beckoned to her and she regarded it longingly.  
There was really nothing left to do. She could monitor the rest of the demolition progress from her new home - she wasn't needed here any more.  
Powering down the life support felt strange. It was an admission of defeat in some ways - humanity had failed to save the world in conventional ways and had resorted to extreme technological means.  
Time would be what healed this flayed planet; not an invention, not some breakthrough biogenically engineered super organism.  
The air would be breathable for another four hours but the warmth would dissipate after only a couple. The winter outside was far harsher than anything Leo's ancestors had ever weathered, except during the last Ice Age.  
Stripping off her uniform she tossed it down the chute. Her necklace followed, then her earrings - little vanities she'd kept for herself even though there was no one else to appreciate them.  
The uplink chamber gaped open as she stepped into it.  
"Lights off," she instructed and the consoles went dark, as did the lighting strips in the roof.  
"Set shutdown for thirty minutes. Begin uplink."  
A timer appeared on the sole active console. The chamber door slid closed.  
Lying on the hard metal bench inside the chamber, Leo felt the probes sweep her mind as the nanolasers painlessly destroyed her body, turning it into energy. As her consciousness faded in this world, it coalesced thousands of miles away in the heart of the Mainframe - where she was reborn into a *new* world constructed by humanity *for* humanity.  
Opening her new eyes she looked out onto a pristine beach that swept out in an infinite curve of sun and sand - packed with laughing, tanned humans - all beautiful and perfect.  
The virtual world might not be real, but it was a damn sight better than the frozen ball of waste humanity had left behind.  
Leo sent a command and a swimsuit appeared on her naked body.  
At the very least, she could swim here.

**You have done well**

One more show he thought. One more. 

How long had he been trying to convey the message? The desire burning inside to come out and say, "God is real. I am here to speak on his behalf, and I have a message for you." That message though would be lost on those with years of memories, years of experience, trials and conflict, and personalities set in stone. He knew the truth. He would be labeled mentally ill and the show cancelled. However it was not important they believed. It was only important they lived their life being good to each other. 

How do I explain the impossible to prove. 
**They need not believe** 

The weight of his role sat heavy in his stomach. He all at once wanted to run, to cry, and to scream, "Listen all we need is to be a little nicer to each other. Take time to understand. Take a moment to share with those around you. Help those that cannot do for themselves." How do you teach those that will not listen though. 

 The red one. I will wear the red one today. 

He removed the tissue from around his neck. His makeup was done and it was time for the show to start. He stood up, and wiped the warm tears from his cheeks. When had he started crying. Was it frustration or was it love that had caused these tears.
**I am proud of you**

I will teach those that will listen. 

He walked to the dark door way and waited for his cue. He was about to speak to the ones that would listen. The ones filled with love; hearts still soft. The pressure built deep within him and began to rise. 

One more, I just need to teach one more.
**One by one, and two by two**

He heard the music start. The lights illuminated the facade of his front porch. 

It is a simple message. Wont you be my neighbor? 
**It is a good message my son**

"Hey, Lex, you're being pretty quiet. You ok?" Gretchen's voice broke through his concentration and thoughts, making him blink a few times as he reacquainted himself with reality. 

"He's fine," Jerry waved his hand before picking up his cup. "He's planning his heist tonight, is all. Probably thinking about Spertrad's schedule."

Lex shot Jerry a look. "How would you know?"

"Dude, you go a school of thieves. Didn't you learn that lesson first year when that hot girl tried to hit on you just so she could steal your identity for her junior midterm?"

"Veronica..." Lex sighed. Somewhere in France *la vie en rose* played as a couple kissed in front of the Eiffel Tower. 

"She never even liked you," Gretchen put down her fork. "You know she was just using you until she could become you."

"Yeah, I know," Lex sighed. "Doesn't mean the sex wasn't good."

His friends screwed up their faces and Gretchen stuck out her tongue and made a retching sound. 

"Right. So back to your heist, dude you've really got to come up with a better passcode than 7459243."

"What's wrong with my passcode?"

"Well, I got past it, for one," Jerry gave me a wink. 

"Yeah but you specialize in computer and intelligence theft. The layman couldn't get past that code. Plus you know why that combination is significant."

"Oh come on, Lex," Gretchen rolled her eyes. "Everyone knows that's the phone number of your first big steal."

"They do? How?"

Jerry raised a hand. "Mr. Computer and Intelligence theft, speaking."

Gretchen smiled at him. The three were as close as close could be, and over their four years at Minuit they'd faced so many adventures and so much trouble that they probably couldn't forget the others even if they tried. 

"Alright. So maybe I should change the heist. If Spertrad catches me I'll fail my thesis and I'll have to repeat. I've got one chance."

"Yeah, vice stealing is tough. Hard marks but rewards that can't be matched. Me? I'm going to be a big time crime lord blackmailing and playing puppeteer. Gretchen will gain all the keys to all the mansions she could ever want. But we all know Lex is going to go down in the history books as what we all truly are."

"Thieves," Gretchen and Lex replied in unison. 

"Morals be damned," Jerry toasted his water. They all drank. 

As the bell that signaled the end of dinner sounded, the three pushed back their chairs and stood. Gretchen pulled on the skirt of her uniform to inch it back into place and gave Lex a wink when she caught him looking. "Good luck tonight, ok? Don't get expelled and don't fail and don't get your identity stolen again."

"Thanks, Gretchen," Lex smiled. "I'll do what I can."

---

He stood outside the Headmaster's office and tried to quiet his mind. He listened for sounds, looking around. He had remembered to take care of the security cameras. They would be displaying an empty hallway all night. Spertrad's office had none, it would have compromised his integrity. 

His tools worked quietly and after a few moments he was in the door. It was just difficult enough that Lex's feeling of unease started to lift. He couldn't see how breaking into Spertrad's office was possible. They were the best school in the world. They *had* to know what was up. 

The key wasn't anywhere to be found. He tried several of the drawers, making sure to leave no prints and leave nothing out of place. He did not turn on the light as he tiptoed over the office. 

He found it after five minutes, sitting on a desk toward the back of the room. He grasped it in his hand and began to make his way out of the office. 

On the back of the door was an envelope with his name scrawled across the front. Lex froze as he looked at it. After a few moments he pulled it down and opened it. 

Inside was a letter. 

*Dear Mr. Thatcher,*

*Congratulations on your final test. You've received an outstanding score, as was expected. You are, as of this moment, no longer considered a student, but a true thief. As such, we are inviting you to join us on a very interesting project. There will be danger, but the reward is far beyond what you could ever imagine.*

*If you accept, find the door to which that key fits. You may need to use your friends' skills. Once you find that door, you will be truly accepted.*

*If you do not wish this, please leave the key on my desk. Rest assured, it will not affect your grade.*

*With sincerity,*  
*Henry Spertrad*

Lex looked down at the key in his hand. There was no question of what he had to do. He closed his fingers around the key as he left the office. 

Now all he had to do was find that door.

#### [EU] Ron Weasley begins to doubt his wife's fidelity when he finds his daughter Rose can talk to snakes.

Score: 1133

The encroaching heat outside signalled the oncoming summer, and the need for another sip of water by the thirty-six year old red head. He, his wife, and family had all made a habit of gathering during the summer and winter to see each other and have the kids play together. They met exactly long enough for each child to pick where to go, along with each head of each family.

Of course Rose decided it was a wonderful day to go to the zoo when it was almost summer.

"Bloody hell," muttered Ron, wiping his brow with the back of his hand. He peered at his hand and shook the sweat off. The families typically split up, telling the kids where to meet them and letting the kids run off. But of course he went to the john and now found that the adults had all migrated to parts unknown.

He considered looking for everyone. Really, it would be easy to do. But the heat was not kind to the fair skinned man, and so, he sought comfort in a cooler environment instead. Any that he could find.

As fate would have it, it was the reptile exhibit that was kept relatively cool. Reptiles. He had just about enough of those buggers for the rest of eternity. He went to turn a corner in the exhibit when he spotted his daughter alongside his nephew, Albus. They were giggling and talking to each other. Doing his best to make not a sound, he decided to rest his back against the corner he had just turned. Eavesdropping was frowned upon and he hated when his parents did it when he as a boy, but he had come to understand where his parents were coming from. He worked often, and his daughter spent more time with Hermione than with him, though their time together was nothing less than special.

Then he heard what he thought he'd never hear again: the low, faint hissing of parseltongue. He turned his head to look to his daughter and nephew once more. He expected it to be Albus speaking it. Instead, he found the speaker to be his daughter. Rose. Speaking parseltongue. What in the world. The snake behind the glass lifted its head and hissed at her in return, forked tongue flicking about. It reminded him too much of... of...

He looked between Albus and Rose. They did look SO much alike. He felt anger rising in him. It was Voldemort or Harry, and Voldemort was dead. He quickly headed out and looked for his good-for-nothing "best friend."

He found everyone sitting together at the food court, save the kids of course. Good. He saw Harry and Hermione talking and laughing. Those things he saw back in the hoarcrux days weren't illusions after all. He balled up a fist and went to Harry, tapping his shoulder. Harry turned to look. And Ron planted a firm right into Harry's nose. His parents stood up as did Hermione.

"What the bloody hell is wrong with you!?" asked Hermione, looking around before taking out her wand. Ron went to her and put his hand on her wand to prevent her from healing the swearing-Harry's nose.

"What the bloody hell is wrong with me? What the bloody hell is wrong with you! I can't believe you. You and Harry. You two really..."

"Ron, what in the world are you talking about?" asked Molly.

"Rose was speaking Parseltongue," he said stiffly, trying to keep himself from taking out his own wand and just causing havoc. "And the only one who can speak Parseltongue is..."

"Is Rose, you daft idiot." Hermione said, getting angry. "Harry can't speak Parseltongue anymore."

"She's right, you know, and I would never--"

"Shut up, Harry." Ron said in angrily, glaring at his wife. "Really? You mean to tell me she just was born knowing it?"

"No. I bring Rose books back from work to read sometimes. She likes languages. There is a beginner's vocabulary with Parseltongue in one of my books." Hermione rubbed her head with a hand. "Which you would know about if you actually read with her and talked with her about books instead of quidditch!"

"I can't believe you're even humoring this thought," remarked Harry, trying to nurse his bleeding, likely broken nose.

"It's ridiculous... here, Harry, I'll take care of that," said Arthur, who quickly mended his nose via use of magic.

"Let's say Rose DID learn from a book and not from Harry, how do you explain her and Albus looking so similar!"

"Your SISTER is Albus's MOTHER." Hermione said a bit exasperatedly. As if on cue, Ginny came over.

"Hey, everyone, I'm back from the gift shop," Ginny said, bags with the zoo's logo in hand. She looked around at everyone tense. "Did I miss something?"

"Your brother is positively mad. That's all."

#### [WP] Instead of the death penalty, convicted criminals are sentenced to have their minds overwritten by that of a recently deceased notable individual.

Score: 1121

I knocked softly on the mahogany door frame, not certain if I should interrupt the Senator. He was busy reading over something on his desk, as he often was. "You, er, wanted to speak with me, Senator?" 

He looked up at me and smiled. Even with the kindly facial expression, I was still repulsed. Hard *not* to be as a young black woman with the face of the nation's most notorious KKK leader staring back at me. The giant swastika tattooed in thick black ink across his forehead was particularly unnerving. "Yes, yes, Jessica. Come in." His tone was always so warm and inviting.

Senator Hutchinson had died two months ago. His old body had, at least: an embolism right in the middle of a meeting with the Thai ambassador. Thankfully, scientists from the National Institute of Health had been able to get to his corpse within a short time and entered him into a new test program that would transfer his memories and personality to a 'host' body. And that host body was supplied by the state of Texas in the form of its most recent victim of the death penalty: Martin LeDoux, Grand Dragon Wizard or something. He'd masterminded the lynching of dozens of African Americans in a widespread terror campaign all across the South, and justice had been served just hours after Senator Hutchinson died. His brain was wiped clean, and Senator Hutchinson's mind was transferred over. 

"I can come back if you're busy," I told him. I wasn't sure what this was all about. 

"No, no," he waved me off. I caught a brief glimpse of the burning cross tattooed across his forearm. "Now is a perfect time. I was just doing a bit of light reading. But I'm feeling somewhat peckish. How about we go grab some dinner?" I nodded, and he rose from the desk. 

He handed me the book as we walked out of his office toward the elevator at the end of the hall. "Really fascinating stuff." It was titled "Divine Intervention: the Story of John Babbacombe Lee." On the cover, there was a photo of a set of gallows against a dull, cloudy grey backdrop. I'd never heard of him, but I could guess what it was about. The Senator had gotten somewhat obsessed with the death penalty ever since his recent incident. 

"Who was he?" I asked as we entered the Senate elevator. 

"A murderer in Britain," the Senator answered. "Well, supposedly. The book goes into that in some detail. Circumstantial evidence, unreliable witnesses, you know. The justice system back in the 1800s isn't quite what it is today. He had a long criminal record, and it seemed like the State just found it easier to hang him."

I flipped the book open to a page with a picture of him, with crooked teeth and wearing a ratty old coat. The elevator dinged, releasing us into the parking garage. Senator Hutchinson beeped the car with his keys, and we headed in that direction. 

"Well anyway. The crime isn't what's so interesting about this story. See, they tried to put him to death. Capital punishment was far more common back in those days. Anyone who looked at the Queen the wrong way was thrown into a noose, you know?" He laughed, and I tried to chuckle a bit. It was far too morbid of a subject to joke about, but there was no dissuading the Senator from his newfound passion. He had even introduced bills into the Senate to reform the national capital punishment laws to allow for more testing of the reincarnation procedure that he'd gone through. 

"They tried to hang him," the Senator said as we climbed into his car. He put his hands on the steering wheel, and I tried not to look at the letters spelling out 'LYNCH' and 'NEGRO' on his knuckles. The laser tattoo removal procedure was taking far too long for my tastes. "But then the trap door on the scaffolding failed to open! Can you imagine? He was up there ready to die, and then poof! Nothing. So then they tried it again, and the same thing happened. Saved! And then *one more time*, and it still didn't work." We pulled onto the street and accelerated toward the Capitol Hill neighborhood to find a restaurant. "Well, the executioners at that point were so amazed that they didn't want to execute him anymore. They figured that there was some divine intervention at play, and his sentence was commuted."

"Very interesting," I told the Senator. "You know, I thought th..."

Before I could change the subject to something less depressing, he interrupted me. "Isn't it funny that they'd leave something like that to chance? I mean, you dodge a bullet three times and you're considered immune?" He wrenched the steering wheel suddenly to a hard left, swerving into a dark alley. "Nowadays you only need to dodge that bullet *once*, and they give you a Senator's memories and stick you in his office!"

Before I could process exactly what he'd said, men in white hoods streamed from the back of the squat brick townhouse nearby, tore open the passenger door, and dragged me from my seat.

"*MEGAKILL*" the announcer declared as I headshotted a blue Spartan, sending his corpse flying out of the Warthog.

"Yeah, bitch," I gloated into the microphone. 

"You shouldn't use language like that," Dad berated me from across the living room. I rolled my eyes and ignored him. I reloaded and went on the prowl for a Scorpion I could use.

"Is that all you're going to do today?" Dad asked, putting down the new galaxy he was working on.

"There's nothing else to do around here," I complained, gripping the controller tight as I ran from another character who had ambushed me. No luck; he killed me, then teabagged my corpse. "Fuck!"

"What did I *just* say about language?" Dad growled. He came and stood in front of the television, with lightning erupting from his fingers. "You know what you have to do, and it's not going to help you to procrastinate. Each day, the Antichrist on Earth earns more and more followers; he's even considered a serious candidate for President of the United States! That's more and more souls going straight down the drain and into Hell. And meanwhile you had to go get yourself run over by a car at the age of 15, didn't you? What were you thinking?"

"Dad!" I whined, trying to see around him as my K/D ratio sank. "Come on! I'll go back tomorrow, I swear."

"That's what you've been saying for *months*," he countered. "Now put down the game!" The controller in my hand instantly turned to salt and crumbled into a small white pile in my lap. On the TV screen, the 'controller disconnected' notification popped up. Other players still in the game were making fun of me through the headset.

"Great. Thanks, Dad. Now my whole team is going to lose."

"Just like your 'team' in real life on Earth is going to lose!" he shouted, causing the pictures on the walls to rattle and fall. "Maybe *now* you'll get off the couch and back to the planet to judge right from wrong and begin the Rapture! It is your responsibility to end mankind and condemn the wicked!"

"Yeah, yeah," I grumbled, pushing the salt around the couch aimlessly. I'd heard the same thing from the Archangel back when I was alive. He'd visited me multiple times with the whole flaming sword bit, trying to goad me into starting Judgment day. But that just sounded like a whole lot of work. And the crucifixion from last time wasn't particularly pleasant, either. 

"Can't you send someone else?" I asked. "Make Gabriel do it. He's the kiss-ass who wants to be your son anyway." I shot an angry glare at the portrait of Dad's favorite archangel on the wall. "He *loves* being the Messenger, and I'm sure he'd be happy to judge people and sit at your right hand."

"That's not how it works," Dad countered. "It has to be you! You are my son!"

"Well I never wanted to be!" I cried out, running into my room and slamming the door shut.

-----

"Son?" There was a gentle tap on the door.

"What do you want?" I asked through my pillow.

"I have a compromise," Dad said. "I think you'll like it."

I sat up from my bed. Through the window, I could see St. Peter sorting the good from the bad; the Gates rarely opened nowadays. Maybe Dad was right; maybe I did need to do something about it.

"What is it?" I asked finally.

He slipped something under the door. A small green plastic case. An... XBox game?

I crossed the room and picked it up. "JUDGEMENT DAY," was plastered across the top, and the box art showed me fighting the Antichrist in the middle of the Vatican. Blurbs on the box described all of the awesome powers I could use to condemn the damned. The "Four Horsemen" companions all sounded pretty bad-ass. There were a few quotes on the box, including: "'Even I gotta admit, this apocalypse is pretty fucking cool,' - Lucifer."

"What do you think?" Dad asked from the hallway. "I was thinking we could play it together?"

There was a rapid knock on the door.

"Ma'am?"

"Ugh...." I groaned and tried to cover my head with my jacket. But it wasn't enough to stop the bright light from streaming through the Oval Office windows. "What do you want?" I managed to yell. 

The headache hit like an oncoming train. It was like the Marine band was playing right in my cranium at full blast. Every single sound seemed to be amplified by a thousand. 

"They need you in the briefing room, Ma'am." I winced at the sound and grabbed my skull, trying to stop the throbbing pain.

Eventually I managed to pull myself upright in my chair, knocking over a near-empty bottle of tequila that sloshed quietly onto the floor. The desk was littered with shot glasses, salt, and squeezed out lime wedges. Even looking at the mess made my stomach roil, and I wondered if my rubbery legs were sound enough to make it down the hall to the toilet. 

"I'll be there in a minute," I croaked back. The press secretary could stall for a few more minutes; that was his whole fucking job. I rubbed my temples and squeezed my eyes shut tight like I could just force the pain out through my ears. God, what the hell had happened last night? I'd been at the state dinner with President Ankundinov and we'd come back to the office to get away from those stuffy boors in my Cabinet for a bit... 

I managed to open my eyes just long enough to look at the couch across the room to where the Russian president was drooling all over one of the couches in his sleep. On the coffee table, there were thick binders stamped with the CIA insignia, and what looked like huge piles of maps and troops readiness reports. 

"Ugh." I reached for a waterbottle from under the desk and chugged the entire thing. *Time to sober up*, I told myself. *Have to meet with those damn reporters about... shit, what was the press conference about?* Was it the education bill? It all seemed to kind of run together as President. I was constantly running back and forth putting out fires so quickly that there wasn't even time to understand what had started them. 

I fumbled over to the phone on the desk and pressed the speaker button that connected to my secretary. "Diane, could you bring me a cup of coffee?" Wait, there was something else I was supposed to ask about... "Oh, and what's the press conference about?" Even after the water bottle, my tongue felt parched and I could still tell that I was slurring ever so slightly. I've gotten pretty good at covering that up, though.

"Right away, Madame President. And the conference is to answer questions about the military action in Mexico." 

*The what?* I thought for just a moment.

On the couch, Nikolai stirred and sat up. His hair, normally clean and crisply combed, stuck out at crazy angles like some sort of 60-year-old punk rocker. "Who is zat?" he said, "Your muzzer?" He gave a chuckle at his own joke that turned into a hacking cough. Nikolai was a pretty heavy smoker. Said it helped build up his tolerance to alcohol because the two addictions were always struggling for dominance. He liked to refer to his dual vices as his own little cold war. 

Diane opened the door and brought in a clattering tray of coffee. She poured a cup for me and tried to cover up her judgmental smirk. "Ma'am, you've got 218 new messages," she said as she set the saucer on the desk in between the little puddles of spilled booze. Her voice was like a pounding drum that reverberated through my skull.

"*218*??" I answered. "*What is going on?*"

She pulled out a notepad from her pocket. "From UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon: President Hughes, you have no authority to invade Mexico, and the United Nations formally condemns this action. Yo..."

"Invade *Mexico*??" I repeated. 

Nikolai chuckled heartily from the couch.  "Ah, yes..."

And then it *all* came rushing back in an instant. How we'd come up to the office and traded tequila shots. I was supposed to be talking to Nikolai about finally ending this war in Ukraine, but that was all forgotten by the wayside. The two of us had nearly drained the bottle, and I'd warned Nikolai that we could run out of tequila soon. And then he'd said something along the lines of "We'll just have to go to Mexico to get some!" And from there the rest of the night was a blur. I briefly remembered calling in the Joint Chiefs and ordering the mobilization of all troops in the Southwest... approving airstrikes on Mazatlan and Mexico city... my last hazy memory was doing victory shots with Nikolai when it was confirmed that we'd seized (and then annexed) the city of Tequila.

"Oh, no..." I said.

"From President Ruiz of Mexico," Diane continued. "This aggression against my country will..."

"I get it, Diane," I said. My stomach churned in waves, threatening to expel its contents all over the desk if I didn't give it some more coffee soon. 

"I can cancel the press conference," she offered, taking pity on me. "We can tell them that a complication in taking Mexico City has come up and you're needed in the Situation Room..."

"Yeah," I said, "Let's do that." 

Diane smiled pleasantly. "And will you be needing that folder on Andorra?" she asked. It was our codeword for: should I set up a cot in the Situation Room to sleep it off? She knew me so well.

I nodded back. "You're the best, Diane."

From across the room, Nikolai chimed in: "You didn't tell me we were invading Andorra too!"

#### [WP] In the afterlife, you start at the age you are when you died, and age backwards. When you reach 0, you are reincarnated.

Score: 1118

Did you ever used to lay awake at night tossing and turning in your sheets, wondering what might have happened in your life? If only you'd gone and talked to that boy that you liked so much in high school, how would everything have turned out after that? What if you had become a writer as you always wanted, instead of majoring in accounting? What if you'd taken that job in that far-off city instead of the safe bet in your home town?

Heaven is your chance. You are 'born' in your old age, and you have the opportunity to go through your life once again, presented with all of the same decisions and knowing what you knew in your old age. Of course everyone will act as though you're still young. Your mom and dad won't see a ninety year old in the crib; they'll see an adorable infant. You'll just have all of the wisdom of your past life to help you on the second time around. This time, you *know* that your high school crush was just as shy as you, and he was just waiting for you to give him a sign. Of course he was too oblivious to catch all of the subtle hints that you tried dropping. But now you won't have to wait till your 20 year reunion to finally tell him. 

But remember that every decision that you change causes a "branch." If you *do* date that boy in high school, maybe you never decide to move out of state for college. Maybe you stay close to home. Maybe everything about you changes and you don't get to relive any of the moments that you wanted to. You don't see your college friends again. You don't go that party that you missed out on because you were too busy studying for a class that ended up not mattering. You don't go into the same field that you loved so much in your first life. You'll get a whole new life, but you miss out on the whole experience of heaven. The opportunity to live it all over again.

For some people, that's what they want. They find their "crux:" That one single most important moment where they can change everything about their lives, and they want to. They can finally see whether the grass really is greener on the other side. For some, it is going with that high school sweetheart. For others, it is taking that a gamble on that dream job. Other times it is all about dropping out of the rat race forever and spending a solitary life traveling and seeing the world. Maybe just escaping the evils of the first go around. It's really up to you.

I have no crux though. I've made no branches. I met you when I was 29 in our last life together, just like this. At this very same table at this very same restaurant. And I bought you a beer, just like I'm doing now. And we were together for seventy five years of blissful marriage. I won't claim that it was perfect, and we certainly had our dark days, but I still don't want to give those up. It's not worth the risk of changing anything, because I want to relive every single moment that we had together.

For most people, heaven is about the chance to change something that went wrong in their lives. For me, it's about the opportunity to spend another perfect lifetime with you.

The human slid out from under the ship, blinking as he came back into the light. The expression on his face made me worried that I would be stuck here for even longer; I had already been on this technology-forsaken world for half a local rotation, and I had no desire to spend any more time than was absolutely necessary.

"How long's it been since ya put oil in this thing?" he asked.

I blinked.

"Ummm.... In local time...." I quickly punched some numbers into my wristband calculator. "It's been.... two thousand and sixty three rota... days."

The mechanic's eyes widened. "It's been six years since ya got yourself an oil change?! Well there's your problem! Can't imagine the hell you've been puttin' on your engine.... Well that should be an easy fix at least. Mkay, gimme ten."

Before I could ask him what "Ten" meant, he had grabbed a large black bottle and disappeared back under the ship.

A short time later he slid back out and signaled for me to climb into the cockpit. Upon seeing that I was settled, he placed a pair of headphones over his ears and told me to try to start the ship. Once again, I heard the sputtering sound of the hyperdrive failing to complete initiation. I shook my head. Another failure. And this planet was supposed to have the best mechanics.

I turned to thank him for his attempt, only to see that he had climbed up next to the window to stare in at the control panel.

"Whassat blinking light?" he asked.

I looked where he pointed. "That's the hyperdrive light, the whole reason I'm in here in the first place."

"Oh!" he said with glee. "Well why didn't ya say so? I tell ya, people come in here all the time sayin' their stuff don't work and they don't know why, when it's sayin' it right there! So, this light, it's not s'pposed to be blinking, is it?"

"Well.... No," I said, confused. "It's supposed to be solid, but that means there's a problem with the engine."

"Kid," said the mechanic with a laugh. "That ain't an engine problem, that's a computer problem. And there's only one way to fix a computer problem."

He leaned in close.

"Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

#### [WP] It is illegal to contact the humans, as they wear an evolutionary scar from their time as prey. It is known as "fear" and it makes them volatile and unpredictable.

Score: 1115

Most species in the Council have always been the dominant species of their respective planet. The Garth were the first predators on their planet, and were such efficient hunters that no other predatory species was able to evolve. The Mik'thar, with their hive mind, were able to arrange ambushes that no animal on their world could withstand.

The Terrans, however, are only recently the dominant species. They are a young species, only existing for a thousandth of a galactic cycle, and their dominance has been only a tenth of that. For ninety percent of their existence, they were both predator and prey. They would hunt what they called a "mammoth", while at the same time watching behind themselves to ensure that they were not being hunted by a "sword-tooth tiger". This unique development gave the humans something that no other known sapient species has.

It gave them fear.

I see you whispering amongst yourselves. I imagine what you are saying... "Does he mean to say that we do not feel fear?" You do not understand.

The species of the Council feel fear in the highest levels of consciousness. We determine that there is a way in which an endeavor could fail, and, in hopes that it does not, take action to avoid failure. We call this desire to avoid failure, fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection. On a battlefield, some may experience fear of death, but even that is primarily used to focus on the most reasonable course of action.

The Terrans are different.

Their fear is not the result of higher-level thought determining that something could end badly. Their fear is tied deeply to their evolutionary history, and as such is biological, existing on a subconscious level beyond many Terrans' control. When a Terran feels fear, it is not a tool to seek the most reasonable course of action.

It is a tool to ensure survival.

Fear throws a Terran back into the middle of their species evolution, to the time where every rotation was a struggle for their very survival. The Terrans have many terms to describe this sort of survival struggle. "Dog eat dog", referring to their world's *canis* species, for example. Perhaps most chilling, "Kill or be killed".

Fear for Terrans is not a rational process. This on the screen is a picture of what the Terrans refer to as a "spider". Spiders are generally smaller than a Terran's thumb, and yet it is estimated that five percent of Terrans have a deep-seeded fear of spiders. Other common fears are enclosed spaces, high places, and darkness. None of these are rational fears, and the Terrans themselves admit so. They simply accept the fears as a part of their lives.

It would be one thing if they simply had irrational fears that existed on a subconscious level. Every species in the Council has its quirks. The problem is that their fear runs deep enough, is old enough, that it has affected their evolution. When Terrans feel fear, there is a part of their brain organ that begins to excrete [adrenaline]. Their brains naturally produce combat drugs!

The Terrans feel fear deeper than any other species of the Council, for irrational reasons, and become unpredictable and combative when they do so. It is my proposal, therefore, that we cut all present and future ties with them, for preservation of ourselves.

I am sure you feel the same fear that I do.

Score: 1112

Felix was the one.

Notice how I said *was*. Because he is now past-tense. He is now gone. He is now gone, and I am now alone. Again. 

Yesterday, I purged my apartment of his presence. Every photograph that depicted his snarky grin was melodramatically burned. His favorite blue hoodie, the one that always smelled like him, went in the Dumpster out back.  I threw out every single plastic container of blueberry yogurt in my fridge- I'd only liked it because *he* had. A year's worth of memories, trashed. 

I deleted his phone number from my contact list. I sat down on my empty couch and stared at the television for a full half hour, watching an infomercial for a vacuum cleaner, telling myself that I was not allowed to cry any more.  

And then I called Mark. 

"You were right," I said as soon as he picked up the phone. "I can't believe that I didn't listen to you." 

There was silence on the other end for five full seconds.

"Don't apologize," he said. "It's not your fault the guy was a scumbag. It's not your fault that he cheated on you. That's on *him*, not you." Mark's voice was so soothing. It reminded me of fifth grade and the blue slushies we got every single summer day when we were stuck between high school and summer school.

"I should have trusted you. You're always right." I confessed. I laughed, remembering the marriage pact we'd made when we were fifteen, freshman year. We'd even pinky-sworn.  "Maybe we should just get married. At this point, my romantic prospects are hopeless." 

Mark laughed on the other end of the line. God, that sound was so refreshing. "How about this- I'll come over and bring some Ben 'n Jerry's and a full season of Seinfeld on DVD, and we'll forget about that jerk of a boyfriend together." 

"Sounds great," I agreed, and it was settled. 

Twenty minutes later, and the bell rang. I threw open my front door with a grin, expecting to see Mark's smiling face, but instead what I saw... someone else.

"Felix?" I asked, incredulous. My first instinct was to scream at him, demand an explanation for the way he left me, but then I noticed the blood. *His* blood. The left half of his face was masked with it. I'd heard that head wounds bled a lot, but I'd  never seen so much blood in my entire life. 

"What...Felix, what happened? Are you okay?"  I was expecting him to say something, anything, but he just staggered towards me, his eyes staring past me, as if into the distance, and collapsed against me, holding me in his arms. I could hear his breath. It was coming in ragged, heaving gasps.

"Mark...I told him I didn't want to leave you..." He stammered.

"What?" I was so confused by everything he was saying. What did this have to do with Mark? 

"Mark told me...to leave you....he paid me...he blackmailed me...he threatened me..."

"I don't understand!" I said frantically. "You can't be right!"

"He said...that you *belonged* to him. And when I told him that you didn't...that you didn't belong to anyone, he... he got really angry."

No. No. No. Every relationship, every man who had ever left me. Mark had always been there to comfort me after they were gone. He disapproved of every guy I ever dated, every guy I ever looked at.  

He was manipulating my life, this whole time.

The door was wide open, like a gaping wound, when Mark stepped in. He was carrying a grocery bag, and smiling, but as soon as he saw Felix, his expression grew ugly.  

"Get away from her," he growled, dropping the bag, advancing quickly, purposefully, with venom in his eyes.  

Then, for just one moment, his gaze flickered towards me, and he met my eyes.  He smiled, sweetly, and I saw the little boy I'd shared slushies with years ago.

"Don't worry," he reassured me. "You belong to me. I won't let him hurt you anymore." 

He was still smiling sweetly at me when he slammed Felix's face into the granite countertop.

#### [WP] A new virus sweeps the nation killing hundreds. It turns out the virus only affects total assholes though. People are unsure if they really want to cure it.

Score: 1107

There were two parts to the dilemma.

First and foremost, what *precise* criteria indicated that someone was "an objectionable personality," as the discovering scientist had said? Was there a specific genetic marker? A hormonal change that activated the virus?

Second, would refusing to treat the virus be an aspect of that criteria?

The questions had been raging through every media circuit and news outlet, much like the plague that they each sought to cover. Had it been any other story, fear-mongering and outright fabrications might have ruled the day... but when executives and journalists had started dropping dead in their desks, tactics had quickly shifted.

"We need," one program director had been quoted as saying, "to find a way of acting like decent people. We can't risk our lives in pursuit of a story. With that said, we *also* need to consider the effect that these new tactics will have on our ratings. It is absolutely essential that we find a means of keeping viewers' eyes on *us*."

The man's lifeless body was retrieved only moments later.

Greed seemed to be a factor, as did a lack of empathy. Selfishness was a fatal flaw, as well. Aggression was an indicator, though not an independent trigger... and much to everyone's surprise, *altruism* seemed to cause as many deaths as avarice. Some theorized that humans were incapable of true generosity, or of kindness without expectation. Others argued that such mindsets were flawed, and that a prevailing internal goodness *had* to exist.

They all died in the end.

All of them, that is, except me.

It's not that I'm a paragon of virtue. Far from it, in fact. It's not that I'm immune, either... it's just that there's nobody left. Something about the virus seems to require a specific interaction with another intelligent entity. For a society so hell-bent on judging one another based on thoughts, it's ironic that *actions* were what mattered in the end.

We had the chance to combat the disease, but we wondered if the world would be a better place if we didn't.

We had the chance to learn and evolve, but we expected other people to do it before us.

We were scared. We were angry. We were closed-minded, stupid, and mired in our own ideas of what was and wasn't "morally right."

In the end... we were *all* assholes.

#### [WP] A "popular" girl falls in love with a "nerdy" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him

Score: 1106

Samantha couldn’t help herself.  Every boy in the school was chasing her.  A lot of them had already had her and wanted more.  She enjoyed teasing them.  It was all too easy.

&nbsp;

They say forbidden fruit is the finest.  After gorging herself on so much adoration, it was the only thing that Samantha could taste at all.  It was no surprise then that she found herself falling for the first boy who simply didn’t seem to care about her.

&nbsp;

At first she’d assumed it was just because he thought he had no chance with her.  It was true of course, there was no way she’d even bother speaking to a loser like him, she’d thought.  It still irked her that he wouldn’t even throw a glance her way.

&nbsp;

It annoyed her enough that she broke her cardinal rule and actually stooped to speaking to the little mouth breather.  She teased, she flirted, he barely looked up from his textbook.  He was getting good grades, it’s not like he had anything else going for him.  He was distinctly average, no skills, no friends, nothing to make him at all noteworthy.  Yet he somehow thought he could ignore her advances?  This wasn’t going to stand.

&nbsp;

Subtlety went out the window as the months rolled past.  At first she’d been worried that pursuing him would make her look bad in front of her friends.  By the end she didn’t care, this was a point of pride for Samantha and she was going to break his resistance.  They mysteriously ended up in the same group for every project, she sat with him at lunch and tried to strike up conversation, shot him glances across the room and everything else she’d ever read about in Cosmo.

&nbsp;

Rumours started to swirl around the school.  It didn’t take a sharp eye to spot her pursuit of the poor little nerd.  Mixed with the level of envy that constantly swirled around Samantha’s clique it made for an explosive scandal.  Everyone was talking about Samantha and her would-be paramour – everyone but he himself.

&nbsp;

He shrugged off confessions, ignored thinly veiled propositions and just generally remained oblivious.  He had to be doing it on purpose, Samantha decided.  Well, if subtlety – what little she’d exercised – didn’t work, then maybe she’d just come out and say it.  It was social suicide, but what had started as a minor annoyance had wormed its way deep enough into her insecurities that she no longer cared.

&nbsp;

She cornered him behind the bike shed during their lunchbreak.  She’d spent so much time sitting here with him, suggestively playing with the hem of her skirt and the buttons on her blouse while he stared at his goddamn textbooks.

&nbsp;

Samantha took a deep breath and prepared herself to throw away what little dignity she had left.  This had gone on far too long.

&nbsp;

“So, you know how prom’s coming up?” she asked, twirling a loose hair around her finger as she smiled coquettishly at the only man who’d ever resisted her substantial charms.

&nbsp;

“Uh, yeah,” he croaked.  Even his voice was awkward.  It was absurd that he wouldn’t leap at the chance to get with this.

&nbsp;

“Well, I don’t have a date, do you?”

&nbsp;

“Ugggh, no.”

&nbsp;

“So maybe we should go together.  I think you’re super cute.”

&nbsp;

“Er, Samantha, I…”

&nbsp;

“You will!” she excitedly finished the sentence for him, “great!  You can pick me up at six.  I’m going to wear pink, so pick a tux that compliments it, ok?”

&nbsp;

“Uggh, Samantha, I’m…I’m gay,” he finished with an apologetic shrug at the crestfallen cheerleader.

#### [WP] You swerve to avoid a squirrel. Unknown to you, the squirrel pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the squirrel arrives.

Score: 1102

A coincidence is always possible, but only a fool would have jotted this down under "luck." 

When I left the police station my head was still spinning. One of the cops said I was lucky to still have a head, but I thought he wasn't giving me enough credit. The bulldozer was coming for my legs first, I'd at least have swung my torso out of the way.

The construction workers were, of course, apologetic, and I had noticed the site at least a month before -- a new store, or something, going up, so they'd brought in the heavy equipment. Really it had never occurred to me that it would become so dangerous, or I'd have walked on the other side.

They assured me two and three times over that it was very, very rare for a piece of equipment to get out of control like that, let alone go careening for the sidewalk. To be fair, I was almost more embarrassed than they were. I'm usually a pretty fast guy, and it was only because I was tripped up by a garbage can that I ended up in the path of the dozer.

At any rate, I was still alive, so the focus on me didn't last long. Eventually all the involved parties -- the cops, the construction workers, some witnesses (and me, trapped doing paperwork) -- were gathered in the lobby of the police station a few blocks down. The squirrel had captured everyone's imagination.

I'd just assumed someone had hopped back in the dozer and swerved into the road before it got to me, but the workers testified that they'd come nowhere close to it. Jimmy, the guy who'd left it going, never reached it. But the dozer had obviously changed direction, and they were all wondering whether the squirrel that had hopped out of the cockpit had had anything to do with it.

I had nothing to say about it, and left the station as soon as they'd let me. Even though they said their agency would call I doubted that I'd be getting back to them.

I took the other side of the street on the way back. Of course I'd seen the squirrel too, but I'd seen it last. To me it seemed like the squirrel had climbed out of one of the city trees and scampered away after the commotion. But deep down I knew there was more, because when the squirrel got to the end of the block he paused and looked straight at me. Rearing up, he stood as tall as he could and -- curse my poor eyesight -- almost looked to be raising a paw in the air with an attitude that implied goodbye. I rose when I saw him and from a higher angle I saw that the gesture was being delivered almost with reverence. Then he bowed against the concrete, and the windless summer day presented him flat against the earth. Hot and still. If a squirrel had lain like that a few feet back -- in the road -- it would've been mistaken for roadkill. 

I was quickening my pace away from the sidewalk scene. I knew I'd seen the squirrel before, but a torrent of tears came to me at the same time. I'd seen many squirrels before the bumper of my car and it was this one -- only this one alone -- who'd made it.

Score: 1102

After four days of intense debate, the United Nations Security Council had still not reached a consensus regarding the alien message. 


The Chinese argued that the message should be taken seriously and that all radio and television signals had to be shielded or restricted. The Russians proclaimed that the planet was under threat and the world should pool resources and mobilise immediately.
The American proposal was to contact the sender of the message to learn more of the threat. 


The US President was about to argue his case yet again when he saw his Science Advisor approaching.


"Sir, you have to see this. We've decoded more of the message."
The President scanned the sheet of paper. "What am I looking at here?"
His advisor spoke quickly. "It's a spatial chart. These co-ordinates refer to quasars and we're pretty sure these refer to black holes. It tells us where in space the aliens consider the threat to come from."


"And where would that be?" the President demanded.


The Science Advisor swallowed nervously. "Well, Sir, we've narrowed it down to our system."


"Our system?"


"Yes Sir. You see, the message isn't to us, it's about us."

Superbowl LI was already off to a rocky start, with teams participating from across the galaxy formed by alien races that only recently sought to conquer the earth. There was a brief halt in the games when the sentient robot army launched an attack, but most of them were washed away by a tsunami, just one of the many aspects of the now completely unstable global climate. It also almost seemed predictable at this point when a new mad scientist announced his plans for world domination only for his lab and super weapon to be flattened by a meteorite soon after. Therefore when "Doctor Devilish Doom" took control of the broadcasting equipment, it came to nobody's surprise when he and his "Longrange Light Laser" were destroyed by a chunk of rock from space.

"It's not even a fair election, Malagor has a potion of mind control, all of his supporters are only doing so by his will!"

His opponent, a middle aged woman in a lab coat pointed an accusatory finger at Malagor.

"Excuse me Doctor Schnitzelwitz, but isn't it the case that your voter group is mostly comprised of clones? Must be difficult winning the support of oh lets say five people?" replied Malagor, gesturing at the other half of the crowd. Indeed, several of the people looked extremely similar if not identical. As if on cue one man's false mustache then fell off. Before Schnitzelwitz could retort however the ground between the two of them split open and a pillar of flame erupted outward incinerating both of them. A figure covered in fire then appeared from it, who scanned the room then shouted,

"Silence fools! I Lavalar proclaim this to be my new domain! Anyone who does not agree shall meet the same fate as them!"

From the back of the room one man turned to his doppelganger next to him and remarked,

"Ah, right. I remember now. So I'm getting vaccinations? And my boy?"

"Yes, that's right. The Church just wants to test the logistics of obtaining licenses and distributing vaccines *en masse*. So we are giving out a few vaccines in places all over the world this week."

"That sounds great. And it's free?"

"Of course."

The nurse approached Mr. Derkshire with a needle. "Left arm or right arm?"

As he unpacked his notebook and pen, Logan realized he'd forgotten his glasses. 

'That's a first,' he mused to himself, wondering where he would have left them.

The prof sauntered into the lecture hall and began to set up, calling out reminders for an assignment due the following week. He wrote down a list of resources for the assignment on the chalkboard before segueing into the lecture topic.

Logan squinted at the letters on the board before realizing he didn't have to squint to see them. He figured it was because he was sitting at the front of the hall.

'Maybe I don't need such a high prescription anymore?' he'd heard that some glasses correct the issue over time, depending on what the problem was. No one had ever indicated that he may not need them one day, however.

He took notes throughout the hour and a half lecture on methodology and tried to remember where he had left off with his project. As he couldn't recall making any significant progress on it, he decided to hit the library after class. It would be nice to do some research without getting interrupted by his little sister every five minutes like he did at home. He was musing about his project when the professor called on him to answer a question.

"Sorry? Could you repeat that?" Logan asked, embarrassed to be caught wool-gathering.

The professor frowned quickly, but repeated his question and waited. Logan answered, but noticed the professors face had turned black and fuzzy. 

The professor acknowledged Logan's answer and turned back to the board. When he turned around to teach, Logan searched his face over and over, but did not see any indication of blackness again and put it in the back of his mind. He had a project to work on. When the bell rang to signal the end of class, he packed up and headed west towards the campus library. 

"Logan! Hey!"

A familiar voice stopped him in the hallway. He turned to find Alicia, a friend's girlfriend who he'd always had a major crush on. She smiled up at him.

"Fancy meeting you here. What class were you coming out of?"

He chatted with her for a few minutes, trying not to sound like an idiot. He really envied Dylan for having a girl like Alicia. Speaking of Dylan...

"How's Dylan doing?" he hadn't seen him in a few weeks - he was always busy with Alicia, not that Logan could blame him.

Alicia's expression turned thunderous. Her expression turned so dark her whole face looked cast in shadow for a moment. He found her expression very easy to read - Dylan was in trouble.

"He's a jerk," she said flatly. Then, "I gotta go, see you later."

Her face was still angry and Logan noticed her forehead looked *black* all of sudden.

"Alicia, wait!" Logan called, grabbing her by the shoulder before she could get away. He turned her around, searching her face, but the black he had seen was gone. "What happened?"

"He just...two days ago...I..." she was having trouble spitting it out when Logan realized the blackness was coming back. He could see one word in increasing clarity, printed in bold, black letters across her forehead. 

**CHEATER.**

I loved her, he says out loud when he starts writing her a letter:  
  
Once upon a time, there was a girl. This girl, like most girls when they're 20 years old, has issues. She worries about the future, she worries because she has no idea what she wants to become. She thinks that happiness in life comes from the things she does and accomplishes. However, when all her work is done, she feels empty inside. She feels the burning sensation that might soon become a depression. When the work is done, so is she.  
  
Most importantly though, she believes that love is all about the butterflies she feels in her stomach. She does not believe in a God, per se, but she does believe that when she dies, she will be like a star, shining down upon us in the night.  
  
One day, she meets a man on the internet. She looked at his pictures and figured: what the hell, he looks good enough. She started chatting with him, started telling him all about her problems and he did the same. They fell in love.  
  
However, after a little while, she started losing her butterflies, as expected. She did not know whether the man was actually the cause of this or because she simply did not feel those wonderful feelings anymore.  
  
She started doubting him, hell, she even tried to change him. You see, he was a smoker. He was the kind of person who would live his life from day to day, and not worry about the past or the future. Someone who would risk his life, just so that he could die having lived a happy life.  
  
She did not understand why he would take those kinds of risks in life. After all, he knows well enough how painful and agonizing the death of a smoker can be.
She did not understand how someone would risk his or her life just to be happy. She did not understand happiness or what it meant simply because she never quite found out what made her happy.  
  
As time went on, and her workload increased, she started neglecting him. After all, university is her priority at the moment. In doing so, she made him question her.  
  
Why doesn't she want to go out anymore? Why doesn't she want to take a midnight walk with me? Undeniably so, he always sacrificed himself so that she could go on with a smile on her face. He did not understand why she could not make an hour of her time free to simply go out and have a drink. After all, the café was only 2 minutes away from her front door.  
  
As with any love story, things did not end well. Right before the end though, she even made him believe that because he started doubting her, that she did not love him anymore, while in reality she stopped loving him a long time ago but simply could not find the courage within herself to break his heart. After all, he was the kind of guy who would have died for her.  
  
So she said to him: Let's take a break. Let's just be ourselves for a while and see what happens. He simply did not understand. For three long weeks, he could not eat. He could not sleep and he could not even sit at his computer and play video games. She was on his mind 24/7. The entire day he would eagerly wait for a text message from her. She never sent one.  
  
But after those three weeks, he started seeing things differently. She was right. By becoming himself again, he finally understood why she left him. He could finally understand that in fact it wasn't because he doubted her, but because she does not understand the true meaning of love. He finally understood why she tried to change him.  
  
He wrote this story for her, not because he wanted to but because he needed to. He wrote this so that she could find her happiness in life, so that she could finally understand what love is and so that she could finally stop breaking peoples hearts. In the end though, he didn't do it for her, he did it for her future husband.
He wrote: "Once upon a time, there was a girl.."  
  
As he gave her the letter, and watched her read it, he felt those old emotions again. That stinging feeling of happiness and love. The idea that he can have a future with this person. He felt like he could have given her a different kind of letter. Maybe this was his chance to make things right again. Alas, the outcome would have been the same, he thought to himself.  
  
After she was done reading the letter, she bursts into tears, understanding exactly what the man had given her and asked him to hug her one last time. It was the most emotional hug of his life and as he left her there, he finally felt closure.  
  
Maybe one day, she'll find her true love.

The bureaucrat whistled cheerfully as he read the day's routine bribes to me.  "Five million from Exxon to turn a blind eye on their river-mining in Timbuktu," he said.  "Fifteen million from Airbus to quash a chemical factory lawsuit.  And, as always, the daily payment from the Japanese whaling labs."  It was starting to look like another ordinary day here at the U.N. Special Court for Smaller Countries and Open Seas (UN.SC.SC.OS).  Little did the paper pushers know there was something very different about me, their overseer, that day.

"Are you satisfied with the routine bribes today, Mr. Chairman?" asked the presiding judge.  I nodded my assent and he tapped the glass with his gavel.  "That concludes routine bribery.  The court will now move on to ad hoc developments.  The Nestle Corporation has reserved the first block of time.  Mr. Nestle?"

"Thank you," Mr. Nestle was quickly sworn in, in that dark chocolate-colored suit of his.  "Your honor; Mr. Chairman; it gives me great honor to introduce to you," and here he was unrolling a giant paper map of New Guinea on a display board, "a brand new tribe of natives, completely isolated for over 2000 years, discovered mere days ago by Nestle's R&D department.  Ladies and Gentlemen," and now the map was replaced by a close-up of a native warrior, dabbed in chocolate-colored warpaint, "The Nestle tribe of Papua New Guinea!"

There was clapping all around, except from one corner of the stands.  Something seemed to be bothering Phillip-Morris.  Mr. Morris stood up, a daring breach of protocol.  "If your honor would grant Phillip-Morris a moment," he began, very respectfully.  "The clerical records will show that Phillip-Morris actually beat Nestle to this discovery, by a good several hours.  Mr. Nestle, thank you so much for your illuminating presentation, now I will beg you to cede to its rightful discoverers, this latest participant in the great table of humanity---the Phillip-Morris tribe of Papua New Guinea."

There was a murmur throughout the court until the judge tapped the glass, restoring order.  "Mr. Morris, please follow proper procedures," he said.  "The court understands that Phillip-Morris and Nestle independently discovered this new tribe within a very close margin of each other.  Gentlemen, would either of you object if we agree to call it the Phillip-Morris-Nestle tribe of Papua New Guinea?"

"We do not object, your honor," said Mr. Nestle.  "However, we want to stress the importance of preserving the tribe's sacred rivers and pastures, which have so much importance in the natives' religious ceremonies, and which, I've been told by reliable sources, Phillip-Morris has an interest in bulldozing and replacing by a certain tar factory..."

"Now wait a moment!" cried Mr. Morris, jumping over his desk and running to confront Mr. Nestle face-to-face.  "You're just saying that because you want to use those pastures for one of your infamous chocolate mines!  I'll have you know the natives of the Phillip-Morris tribe value tar very highly, and have already expressed great enthusiasm for our factories, which as everyone knows have a very minimal eco-footprint, thanks to Phillip-Morris' commitment to green energy!"

"Gentlemen, please!" the judge tapped the glass furiously.  "Mr. Chairman, have you any thoughts on this tricky situation?"

I rose up from my seat.  "Ladies and gentlemen, the U.N. has been aware of this matter for some time already.  Without getting too much into the details, as they involve sensitive information, I must convey to you the U.N.'s official veto of both representatives' claims.  The tribe will be declared a special protected region, and no corporations will be allowed to develop there for an indefinite period; this decision may be reviewed by the court in future, but not before a period of at least one-hundred-seventy-five (175) years, starting from the end of the current judicial session."

"What!!" Mr. Morris and Mr. Nestle cried in one voice.  Then, united against a common foe, they charged at me.  My bureaucratic assistants jumped up to defend me but they were plowed over.  In an instant, I was exchanging blows with the two companies' reps.

I fought valiantly, but I wasn't accustomed to fighting in the constricting tightness of a suit and coat.  My assailants had the upper hand.  One of them grabbed my collar and tore with all his might.  With a giant rip, my suit came half off, revealing war paint and tribal necklaces underneath.  So much for subterfuge, I decided.  I tore the rest of the suit off, and stood there before them in full glory, with my elephant-tusk kilt, my anklets of boar-skulls, a hideous bone ornament pierced horizontally through my nose.

I jumped up on the desk behind me, out of reach from Mr. Morris and Mr. Nestle.  "Well, it seems you gentlemen discovered my true identity, didn't you!"  From here, I could see the real Chairman, tied and gagged underneath the desk I'd just been sitting at, whimpering and squirming.  "But it's too late, the U.N. has spoken!"  Then, into my conch-shell communication device:  "This is Agent Ooga Booga.  My disguise has been broken, beam me out of here!"  In a moment, I was whisked away by the shimmering swirls of the transportation device.  Standing back in the temple of Kchonga-bonga, I was greeted by concerned looks from my fellow tribesmen.  "It's alright, everyone," I said.  "The veto went through!"

> *Saturday the 22nd of  November, 2014 *  

You wake up when your HCD buzzes.  What’s this, an alarm clock?  No!  It is a Handheld Computing Device.  It contains an internal gyro that, when the audio speakers are disabled, causes the entire object to vibrate when it receives a message.  (But it *can* be an alarm, should you choose to add an Alarm Clock module.)  

You touch the screen and it glows, illuminating your face.  It is a letter from your dear friend, Henrietta, who is inviting you to brunch at a nearby coffee house.  Without leaving the comfort and warmth of your blankets on this chilly November morning, you slide your finger across the glossy glass surface of your HCD and tap a virtual button . 

*blammo!*  

Your response is now flying through the RPCN (radio-phone communication network), and seconds later, Henrietta’s own HCD plays a musical chime, alerting her that you have accepted her invitation.  

As you go about your morning routine, rather than scrape a dangerous razor across your face, you remove your overnight’s beard growth by rubbing an Electronic Razor along your jaw and chin. The device smoothly removes the stubble, leaving your face baby-soft.  It is waterproof and safe to use while in the shower.  

You leave your comfortable domicile and stroll jauntily to the nearby Metro.  Moments later, the great train of the future whisks you several blocks to the coffee house, where you expect Henrietta to meet you.  There is no sign of her.  You whip out your trusty HCD and send her a quick message:  

> Dear Henrietta,  

>  I have reached the Coffee House of the Celestial Deer, when do you expect to arrive?  

> Sincerely, 

> [YOUR NAME HERE]  

You take a seat at one of the outdoor tables of the Coffee House, and presently your HCD buzzes with an update from your dear friend.  

> I’m already here.  Are you at the Coffee House on Juniper Street or the one on Percival Lane?   

Oh gracious you!  There are coffee shops on every corner these days, and you went to the wrong one.  You quickly correct your error and meet Henrietta on the next street.  

After ordering your coffees, the two of you sit at a hand-crafted wooden table, steaming beverages in front of you, each operating your HCDs.  You are checking the latest news regarding politics, world events, and sports, Henrietta is watching a short film.  After a moment, she beams it to your device through the RPCN for you to watch as well.   

To hear the audio, rather than activate your HCD’s internal speakers, you reach into your pockets and withdraw a set of headphones, each nubbin no larger than the first joint of your index finger, attached to slender wires that you install in a port on your device.  

You prop your HCD on its kickstand and activate the video.  Full stereo sound and vibrant, true-to-life color accompany the short film, a comedic piece.  

Later, you and Henrietta use your HCDs to challenge one another to a game.  Perhaps backgammon or chess, the devices synchronize the boards through the RPCN and so each player has full access to the field of digital battle.  

The pleasant brunch ends all too soon; Henrietta’s device rings.  She then activates it and has a quick conversation through it with an unknown person.  As she finishes the quick talk, she turns to you and smiles.  

“I had a good time today, [YOUR NAME HERE], but I better go, my mother has invited me to come over to help her with her shopping.”  

“That’s okay, Henrietta,” you respond in good cheer.  “I need to finish my Christmas Shopping as well.  I shall see you upon another occasion.”  

As you ride your metro tram home, you use your HCD to visit various simulacra shops, selecting merchandise for purchase.  The device signals these businesses with your payment information and address, and your purchases will be hand-delivered to your front door within the week, and beneath the brown paper, each is wrapped with festive holiday colors.  With that, your holiday shopping obligations are completed.  

Ah yes, the future is a grand place to live.  

A grand place, indeed.

(Background info: Joe Chill killed Batman's parents.)

&nbsp;

Joe Chill leaned up against the alley's brick wall. Hands trembling, he pulled a cigarette and lighter out of his coat pocket. White puffs of steam escaped his mouth into the frigid atmosphere as he lit it. He took a long drag and held it in, suddenly gagged, and coughed out plumes of smoke. "Awh, ack, jeez." His trembling subsided as the smoke's warmth filled his lungs. 

The sound of mirthful voices echoed down the opposite end of the alley. Joe reached into his jacket, unholstering a pistol, steeling himself for a robbery. A couple, man and woman, came into view. They looked happy and, more importantly, rich; the lady was wearing pearls around her neck, diamond earrings, and a fur coat. The necklace caught Joe's eye; without taking his eyes off it, he approached the couple, drawing his gun. "This is a stickup." They stopped, a look of dread falling across their faces. "Hand over the pearls."

She began to comply, but her husband stepped in front of her. Joe threateningly waved his gun. "Hey pal, doncha see the gun, get with the program!" To prove his point, Joe angled away from them and pulled the trigger, a shot resounding through the alley. He immediately regretted the decision, his thoughts flying to those who might have heard the gunshot. In a moment though, he realized that it was much worse. The woman turned, her hands falling away from unfastening the necklace, and screamed.

"Bruce!" She fell to the ground besides a small boy, probably barely even ten years old. She lifted his limp head from the ground, sobbing. He was dead.

The child lay just behind where the husband had been standing with a gaping, bleeding hole in his chest; Joe had not seen him behind his father when he approached, his eyes transfixed on the woman. The father, taking one look at his wounded boy, was filled with rage and spun around to take a swing at Joe. Panic filled the mugger, who stumbled backwards, falling to the ground and accidentally letting off another shot.

The second bullet punctured the father's abdomen and continued on, flying through the mother's temple. Both collapsed besides their son. The cigarette fell from Joe's mouth. He dropped his gun, scrambled to his feet, and began to flee the alley. Two onlookers were in his way, mouths gaping. One immediately shouted "Call the police!" and they ran off. Joe turned the other way and bolted down a different alley, ducking behind a building and crawling over a fence towards home.

&nbsp;

The newspaper's headline read "WAYNE FAMILY GUNNED DOWN: THREE DEAD." Joe couldn't bring himself to look at it again, and pushed the paper away, staring into his coffee. His brother, Max, sat down across from him. "Morning," he mumbled through a yawn.

Joe nodded in recognition, but didn't say anything. Max lifted the paper, but barely paid any attention to the headline. He turned straight to the comics. Joe was caught with the front of the paper facing him again. There was a picture of the handsome Wayne family, posed in front of a well-groomed garden, smiling. Joe grabbed at the photo and ripped the sheet out of Max's hands.

"Hey, Joe, chill." Max was mildly irritated, but then smiled. "Chill, get it? Haha." Joe wasn't smiling. "Joe, its funny, cuz its our last name. I didn't even do that one on purpose." Still no response. "You alright?" He put down the paper, looking with concern upon his brother. 

Joe shook his head, handing the front page to Max. "That was me."

Max looked at the picture. "You killed them?" His concern deepened as Joe nodded in affirmation, and he began scanning the article. "Joe, you left your gun! And a cigarette!?" He threw the paper down, furious. "Joe, what the hell did you do that for? I gave you that thing so you could mug people, not murder them!"

"Its not my fault, Max, it was an accident!"

"And now you're in my house, incriminating me!" Max suddenly dropped his temper, switching moods in an instant. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean-"

"No, you're right." Joe stood. "I should be on the run, shouldn't I?"

"Hey, bro..." Max stood too, placing a hand on his brother's shoulder. "We stick together. We're family right?"

"Yeah," Joe responded, melancholic. "We are."

"Lets pack some things today," Max offered, "We'll settle our affairs and get outta town first thing tomorrow morning. Nobody will even remember we were here!"

&nbsp;

The darkness of night shrouded Max's room. He was fast asleep, breathing heavily. A few packed bags lay at the foot of his bed, ready for an early morning escape with Joe the next day. Joe's shadowy figure stepped into the room, stealthily reaching into one of the bags and extracting a handgun. A beam of moonlight shone across his face, reflecting of of tears on his cheeks. "I'm sorry Max," he whispered to his sleeping brother before hastily leaving.

&nbsp;

Lew Moxon leaned back in his chair, talking on the phone. The cord was twisted around his left arm and a thick cigar drooped from his lips. His office was the pinnacle of opulence; everything was either crystal, silk, or shining polished mahogany. "Yeah, that's fine, kill the bastards for all I care," he said into the phone, "Just don't tell 'em I sent ya." Joe entered the room. "Hey didn't I tell you goons to knock first!?" He shouted at the intruder, changing tone to speak to his phone, "Oh, hey listen I gotta go, I'll call you back." He put the phone back on its receiver, straightened up his posture, and addressed Joe. "Joe, what the hell are you doin' here, I thought you were working the alleys down on Brookside." The mob boss tapped his cigar on the edge of an ashtray and then putting it back in his mouth. "You know I won't bail any of you creeps if you don't do you work."

"I'm not working for you anymore, Lew." Joe pulled his brother's gun out of his jacket, aiming at the boss.

Lew gasped and stood, taking a few steps back. "Joe, what's this all about, huh?" He looked around for something to defend himself with, spying a rifle hanging on a rack beside a cabinet, just out of Joe's sight. He began edging towards it. "You want a bigger cut or something?"

"Lew I destroyed a family the other day."

"What, the Waynes? Yeah, I saw that in the paper. Good job, by the way." He continued slowly circling the room towards his rifle. "Joe, you did me a favor there. Thomas Wayne's been a big pain for me-"

"Shut your mouth and listen to me Lew." Joe's grip was trembling. "You know you ruin people's lives every day."

"Joe I don't know what you're talking ab-"

"You run a racket for crying out loud!"

Lew stuttered for a moment, trying to say something but unsure of what to say. "Joe, I don't understand. What are you doing in my home?"

"Its your fault. Even if you didn't do any of it, all of the blood is on your hands."

"Are you actually blaming me for the Waynes? What, your fragile snowflake psyche can't handle a little blood-"

"Its my fault too. I'm the one that killed a boy." Joe's voice cracked, on the verge of sobbing. "But I need to make up for it, Lew. You put me and my brother into this business. You put so many people into a life of crime. It takes lives and breaks families. Your thugs hurt innocent people. I know, I'm one of them! You're part of a sickness that I intend to cure."

"So, what... you're gonna kill every mobster in Gotham, is that it? Go on a one man crusade?" Lew scoffed. "Yeah, that'll work out real well for ya. Just... Joe, just lower the gun and get out. You know what you're doing is crazy. I'll forget you were ever here." 

Joe fought with the offer, and actually considered leaving. He was hesitant to pull the trigger. The thought of taking another life was unbearable, but he could not cope with what he had done and could see no other way to atone for his sins. As he grappled with himself, trying to force justice to be exacted, Lew finally made his way to the rifle.

"Joe, lets face it. You're no Robin Hood or white knight in shining armor." He reached behind the cabinet and carefully lifted the rifle off the rack, not making a sound. "You're a thug; a killer. And you're never gonna change that." Lew paused for a moment, hoping that Joe might turn away to leave, but he didn't. Joe continued facing his boss, tears streaming down his face. "Well don't say I didn't give you a chance." Lew whipped around the cabinet, drawing the rifle up to his waist. Shots sounded out as both men fired at one another, and Lew collapsed, gasping as blood poured out his mouth and down his chin. He had several holes in his chest, but Joe was unharmed.

Joe strode over to Lew, feeling a wave of confidence and catharsis sweep over him. He felt powerful and righteous. It didn't matter what Lew or anyone else said, Joe knew he was right, and suddenly the future seemed a little brighter. He aimed his gun at Lew's face, which was etched with terror and blotched with blood. "I will make justice upon your kind, no matter how tainted with sin I become. I will make the world better and right my wrongs... I won't be a Robin Hood, you're right. And I can't be a white knight; I'm not pure enough for that. But I will become a knight of a different kind: a Dark Knight." He pulled the trigger.

#### [WP] You were born with a secret curse: you involuntarily alternate between each gender every midnight. As a result, you live two different lives. One night, your friends discover your secret in the worst way imaginable.

Score: 1095

"You didn't think I'd find out?" Bonnie yells at me, chucking the room service champagne bucket at my head. "We've been dating for three months now, and I only see you every other day, Kevin! I know you're cheating on me. Who is she? Where is she?"

I want her out, not because she's right, but because her believing that I'm getting some on the side is preferable to her knowing the truth.

But as the alarm buzzes the countdown to Midnight, I know I can't hold her back from making this discovery anyway.

"You want to see her? You want to see the other woman? Then sit down and wait."

The clock strikes Midnight and I take off my suit, letting her get a full view of everything that's about to happen. Because of how rapidly my body changes, I've never had much hair on my body to begin with. But what's left slide right off as if treated with an epilaser.

My legs lose their muscle mass, as the change spreads up from my feet. I go from a size 10 wide in men's shoe, to a size 8 in women's. I can feel my body compressing, as it always does. Three inches in height lost, bringing me down to an even five feet.

My chest balloons outward, and for this part of the transformation, I'm glad the women in my family have small breasts. Nothing over a B-cup. But I can see Bonnie leaning back against the headboard with terror in her eyes. By now, she's become aware of what's happening and she's caught in-between terror and curiosity. And that's what I find strange. The last person to see this happen was only terrified of if being contagious and he bolted.

Bonnie holds her breath as my sexual organs invert into my body, and my face takes on the features of the person I become.

When my hair grows out, I put it in a ponytail and turn to face her.

"Hi, Bonnie. I'm Carolyn. I am the other woman." I look down at her, hoping she'll decide not to run away, but preparing for the worst anyway.

She doesn't say anything, so I open up the suitcase and start putting on Carolyn's clothing. A pair of white panties, and a sheer nightgown. It is after midnight after all.

As I laid down on the second bed, I could feel weight next to me. Bonnie had climbed into bed with me. "Carolyn. I'm so sorry I doubted you. Can you forgive me?"

I had wanted to hear words like that for so long, but now that I was actually hearing them, I was quiet. Instead of responding, I just wrapped an arm around her and held her close through the night.

"Tell me all about it when we wake up, Carolyn." That's all she said, and for the first time since I met her, I felt relieved. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all.

#### [WP] You are an archaeologist and have just dug up a dinosaur. That's because you've dug up an entire museum.

Score: 1094

"Woah! A dinosaur!" I exclaimed as I gently put my shovel down. A tiny creature, no taller than a few inches, crawled out from a miniscule burrow in the sand at the bottom of the excavation site. I retrieved a magnifying glass from my satchel and used it to have a better look at the small creature. 

It was a dark shade of green. Almost brown and slightly mottled in places. Curiously, it had a light coat of tan-coloured feathers covering its backside. The plumage glistened in the afternoon sunlight and even had an orange tinge to it at certain angles. The dinosaur crawled up on to my outstretched index finger and began awkwardly waddling up my glove.

"Fascinating," muttered my companion as he looked over my shoulder and watched the little critter crawl. "What else did we uncover?" He squatted down and used a smaller tool to brush away more of the dirt around the site where the dinosaur had crawled out of. No sooner had he done so when I heard a sharp *clack!* 

"That sounds like you hit something. A buried chest?" I asked as the dinosaur hopped up and down on my open palm.

"Looks more like a small building than a treasure chest," my friend replied. He used a brush to dust off some dirt from the object. "Well I'll be darned."

It was a fancy looking building about the size of a mailbox or a large bread box. It was two stories tall and the bottom story was lined by a series of pillars that held the upper floor up. A small plaque near the entrance had the word *Museum* engraved on it. I put the dinosaur into a glass jar with air holes poked into the top before I went to have a closer look at the building.

With my magnifying glass hovering outside the windows of the museum, I peered inside. But before I could make anything out clearly, something flew out of one of the open windows. I stumbled backwards and swatted my hand around my face, thinking it was an insect. When I finally regained my composure, I saw a tiny spaceship darting around the outside of the museum. It flew around, bumbling about like a bee, before finally landing adjacent to my dinosaur jar.

"Gosh, this is amazing! We've stumbled onto a whole miniature museum full of surprises!" I said joyfully.

"Indeed!" replied my friend. "I can't believe we found all of this on our first try!"

"There's treasure everywhere!" I announced happily.

"Calvin!" yelled a female voice in the distance. "Come on in! It's time for dinner!"

"C'mon Hobbes. Better head back in before Mom throws a fit," I said to my tiger friend. I took him by his tail and dragged him out of the sandbox.

"And bring your toys back in! I'm not buying you anymore toy dinosaurs again if you lose them!"

My plane is delayed. Don't you hate it when that happens? 

It is some sort of mechanical failure, the pilots say. You'd think that the Prime Minister's plane would be maintained in immaculate condition, wouldn't you? They shouldn't be discovering these things right as I'm jetting off to the EU summit with the Russian Federation concerning the state of Crimea. The UN-administered regime of independence for the region has been an utter failure. Instead of creating a stable buffer between Europe and Russia, it's only led to civil warfare. But I'm pushing to end it once and for all.

I've been on the front lines of this conflict, both as a platoon leader during Britain's first intervention in 2051, and as a politician in Parliament urging for greater action against the Russian-backed rebels. I railed against our former Prime Minister's weak response, as well as the pitiful attempts of the EU Expeditionary force. And I did such a good job of it that my own Independence Party won a majority in Parliament only this past year. And, using my newfound political clout, I was able to convince our Russian counterparts to join us for a peace meeting in Tel Aviv. Israel has done a fine job of staying neutral despite sharing a border with the EU's Turkish territory.

After an hour on the tarmac, my plane is finally able to take off. We soon reach a cruising altitude, and I check my watch. The EU President and Foreign Minister should have landed already with their gaggle of Presidents and Prime Ministers in tow. They'll be whisked away to the summit without even checking into the hotel. The limousines will arrive at roughly 2:30, and the bombs are set to detonate at 2:45 in the midst of the scheduled press conference kicking off the summit. Russia's counterpart will also be *conveniently* delayed, sparing them from the carnage as well. Naturally this fact will be held up later as proof of their guilt.

Oh, did I not mention that I'm the reason the plane had mechanical problems? That it's all a deliberate ruse to make it look like I should have been a victim (to gain sympathy in the press) while simultaneously ridding me of those ninnies from the peace bloc who'd prefer to work things out with words? That it will soon be revealed that Russian operatives were the culprits of the bombing? It's the perfect Casus Belli.

We've barely made it over the Channel, and I'm already bored. God, I hate flying. My foot taps the plush carpet impatiently, waiting for the news. It's 2:46 already. What's taking so long? I pull out my notepad, ready to get to work. Even though I can't be seen preparing my speech before I've even received news of the 'tragedy,' there's nobody else in the plane. The pilots won't know what I'm working on here, so they won't be suspicious. And I do want to get a jump on it. After all, it needs to be convincing enough to make the right case. That this tragedy cannot go unanswered, and that I am the man to lead the EU to victory. I'm the only one with the political clout, the military experience, and most importantly: the resolve to see it through. Perhaps I ought to channel Churchill. 

Just as I put pen to paper, the copilot raps on the door. "Prime Minister? There's some news you need to hear."

"Oh no", cried Leltarth, "not on the rug, not on the rug!" 

The bipedal little thing looked quizzically up from the wet patch on the floor, then smiled, burbled, and fell slowly onto its face. Leltarth sighed and gently pushed it upright with one of her spindly insectile limbs. A com-pad nearby began pulsing, informing her that Konnal was checking up on her progress.

"Accept call" she clattered. The misshapen blob looked up with eyes wide, then started to cry loudly. Leltarth rattled her leg spines in frustration, which the creature seemed to find soothing.

"Leltarth, how is your evaluation of the forerunner paleospecies progressing?"

"Not well, I'm afraid. The clone is completely helpless. At first I thought we might have made a mistake, so I went over the reconstruction and cloning transcripts but they're all perfect. But, well..."

"Yes?"

She thrummed her legs nervously as she fought with herself over the controversial hypothesis, the baby staring in rapt attention, apparently fascinated by the gyrations. 

"Konnal, what if their larval form was born with only minimal instincts? What if they didn't have the level of intergenerational memory transfer we take for granted?" 

Konnal remained silent, then cautiously spoke.

"It's an *interesting* idea with some precedents among known pre-sentient species, but do you really think its likely that a civilisation could reach the level of technological sophistication we've seen out there? They'd have to spend..." silence again as he made rough calculations "...the first decade or so of their lives just to become somewhat functional, and even longer to reach a point where they would be contribute to building something like the temples on Ull, or the rings of Nihar." The baby began chewing its own foot.

"That's more or less the conclusion I came to. Can you imagine such a society? The burden of raising each new child? And the fragility of it all! But it could make sense of certain peculiarities we've seen. For example, it certainly sheds a new light on the sheer volume of external recordings they left- if an individual died, anything they had failed to record would be lost. And I think I have some interesting new ideas about their so-called 'temples' which explain their layout and certain artifacts. To me, such sites are starting to look more like places where one generation could train the next. Just an idea at this point of course, but I think it might bear further study"

Konnal mused on his colleague's ideas. They were radical, certainly, but maybe she had a point. But there was a problem, wasn't there?

"Leltarth, this is fascinating but you realise what this means for our original project if true?"

Leltarth whistled sadly.

"Yes. If they did not transfer their knowledge genetically, cloning is a dead-end. We may have to fall back on analysing their written records, which could take centuries."

She turned back and gazed, partly in reverence and partly in disappointment, at the tiny human clone who was busily trying to eat the corner of her desk. It was going to be a long few decades.

In Their ever-growing glory, Those Who Walk Before Us have left another great monument to encourage us on our journey. A great and noble tower, bleached a pure white by the Star, showing Their own passage through this land. Our scouts first spotted it three moons ago, and guided us to it. We know now that we still march on to Salvation, guided by Their ever-present markers. And we have done our part to guide Those Who Walk Behind Us, adding another tier to Their great tower, an inspiration to Those who follow the frozen tundra we leave behind. We will do well to rest here. Our scouts say that the desert is not so distant now, and that we should not expect another oasis to emerge from it for many moons. 

But I am not entirely at rest. We found a smaller monument as well, but it is unlike any that we have seen. It does not depict the great endless plain on which we walk, as all the others do. Instead, it contains a foreign script, and unfamiliar shapes with lines connecting them. It has caused a disturbance among our peoples. Most believe that it was merely a new practice by Those Who Walk Before Us, but there are some who are denouncing it as evil, a work of the darkness that follows behind us. And there are some who say that it bears a message. A message of what, we cannot discern. Myself, I do not know what to believe. I would rather avoid it entirely, but it has become too prominent in my people’s minds to ignore.

“Hi there, welcome to Iron and Steel, are you looking for a membership today or just a one off workout?” She beamed at me with perfect teeth and a perfect and I began to feel self-conscious at the gut which stuck out over my waist band.  Reminded myself that they *always* put pretty girls out front to make you feel more motivated to join. 

Slightly sadly she didn’t need to do her full sales pitch as I fished out the piece of paper I had printed out this morning. A late Christmas gift my Uncle had insisted, but I had a hint of suspicion that he also felt I could lose a few pounds and this was his nice way of letting me know. 

“Uh, yeah, I got gifted a membership here from my Uncle?” I cursed myself at making it a question, I sounded like an idiot - I should have been decisive! Her all-American beauty was making me feel almost nauseous with desire and I had to swallow hard as she reached out and our fingers brushed as I handed over the voucher – c’mon Steve, keep it together. 

She read quickly, her lips moving slightly in the most adorable way. As she reached the gifter’s name her eyes lit up and she turned her full beam smile back on me. “You’re Mr Power’s nephew?” I nodded, unable to trust myself not to dribble if I tried to speak. “That’s *awesome*!” I pictured our wedding and wondered if our children would be as attractive with my genes pulling them down. 

She reached out her hand and I looked at it for a moment in surprise, unsure what to do. “C’mon,” she grinned. “I’ll take you through, show you around and get you set up with someone to show you the facilities.” Dumbly I nodded and let her take my hand and guide me through into the gym proper, trying not to stare at her ass as we walked. 

The gym was fairly small, a couple of dozen stations spread across a medium sized hall, with a water station and doors to the changing area down at one side. I was vaguely aware she was talking to me as we walked, something about towels, but it was lost on me. 

We stopped and after a moment I registered the change and looked up to see her grinning at me. “Here’s your trainer, he’ll get you settled in.” Before I could react she was gone and it was all I could do not to follow her with my eyes. 

At last I was able to force my attention to the man she had left me with and it took several seconds and a half step back before I was able to take him all in. it wasn’t just his size, although he was easily over six foot eight, it was the sheer volume of muscle that stood in front of me. It seemed almost to have its own gravitational pull and although he was standing still, muscles all over his body twitches, as if desperate to be allowed to work. 

“Hi, Steve is it?” I nodded, still dumb, but this time through sheer intimidation. “Welcome to the gym, I see you’ve met my daughter, so let’s get you changed and we can do an assessment of where you are and where you’re looking to be.” 

I was still nodding when he words sank in and their meaning became apparent. *Daughter*, he’d definitely said daughter and now a bolt of adrenaline surged through me as I revaluated my actions of the last few minutes. I decided that I needed a moment to simply recover and getting changed seemed to be my best bet, so following his finger I made my way to the changing rooms. 

Finally I took a proper look around as I moved. The gym was fairly quiet, but at the far end, where I was approaching, two men were working out together, both also extremely athletic looking. As I drew closer I realised that it was an older man and a younger one, perhaps forty and eighteen but as an accepting 21st Century man I made no judgement – takes all folks after all. 

It was only as I drew up alongside them that it finally clicked and I stopped in my tracks and let me head slowly swivel. I’d never seen them up close but they were in the news most days and that jawline, alone with the eyes and the odd pairing, they were unmistakable the Golden Warrior and the Bronze Tiger, London’s most famous crime fighting duo. 

They ignored me and some form of self preservation propelled me forwards again, into the changing room where I sat in amazement. A pair of superhero’s here in the gym – I’d never even thought about it, but they had to work out *somewhere* and this seemed as logical as anywhere I supposed. 

It was only when I had my trousers off and was regretting my choice of gym sorts that the second realisation hit me – the huge blond man who was to be my trainer was also familiar. I crept to the door and opened it a crack and then held my fingers up so that only his nose and golden curls were visible and then pulled out my iPhone and checked the Superhero index for Mr Xtreme - *it was an exact match*! 

It couldn’t be a coincidence, it just *couldn’t* be and so with a sense of growing excitement I pulled on my 5k charity run t-shirt from 1996 and strode back out, suddenly feeling more confident with my own secret knowledge. 

It took less than 10 minutes before Mr Xtreme, or Ben, as he had introduced himself, had exhausted me to the point of quitting. Even on their lightest settings I was completely unable to use most of the equipment, so he had me on floor work with crunches and skipping rope, but my results were unimpressive on both. 

I was completely useless, but amazingly Ben kept up the encouragement, using his kind, deep voice to make me feel like each sit up was an accomplishment and each set up ten jumping jacks a major step. Slowly, as my brain shut down and my body became a numb mess of pain, I began to grow attached to Ben, until my love and reliance on him was greater than the feelings I had had for his daughter just… I checked my watch… 26 minutes ago. 

At last, after an hour I was allowed to stop and Ben let me lie quietly on the floor while he and a short fierce looking man discussed something in sharp whispers in the corner. I wondered, as I passed in and out of consciousness, who else might use this gym, could it be a hang out for the whole Justice Crew? 

As well as Mr Xtreme, Golden Warrior and Bronze Tiger there was the Human Arrow, Maximum Power, Sargent Force, Lady Amazing, The Underwarrior and Team Triplets – maybe they were all regulars here, maybe this was a superhero gym!

Several hours later I arrived back home and after a short session where I covered my whole body in Deep Heat, I jumped in my car and headed for my uncle’s house. He lived in a large sprawling house on the outskirts of town with his name “Maxwell Powers” on the gate in black cast iron letters. As I buzzed at the door I wondered if he perhaps knew and had sent me to the gym as a surprise or if all this would be as much of a surprise to him as it was to me. After all, it was so blatant, no one could have possibly missed it, right?

#### [WP] Humans are actually the most violent, war-geared species in the galaxy. Another alien species has come to us with a request: "We need help killing these guys, they hate us and have oil. Here, have some technology and go nuts."

Score: 1078

After centuries of observation, there was only one inevitable conclusion that the galaxy's many cilivizations had been able to agree upon: humanity was far too dangerous and destructive to deserve faster-than-light technology. The Sentinels, in their report to the leaders of many worlds in the Galactic Council, made particular note of how humans in the Americas were treated once the other humans discovered those lands, and made a pretty obvious comparison to how their own planets would be treated. And that conquest was back when they were still using spears and guns; imagine what they could do with nuclear weapons! The humans would *always* want more. 

-----

The Merida were the first species to break the Pact. Some historians blame the fervent religious cult that had arisen around their chieftan, Hurlosk. Others blame the massive drought that plagued Merida's western hemisphere, making food from their off-world colonies even more important. They could not afford to lose any of their settlements to invading Eian. History could have even been influenced by that popular series of fictional adventure stories about Human warriors, who had achieved almost legendary status on most worlds. Whatever the reason, Hurlosk approached the humans and made them an offer. Reclaim the Merida colonies from the reptilian Eian, and they'd be rewarded with plunder and advanced technology beyond their wildest dreams. But even the Merida weren't foolish enough to offer the wormhole generators that would have allowed humans to travel between solar systems in an instant. 

Humans were amazed by the sudden arrival of the extraterrestrials, and even more astounded by the offer. The nations of Earth had spent years and years trying to calm their own destructive impulses with treaties and disarmament to focus on more peaceful pursuits. And now it turns out that the way for humans to finally reach the stars was to embrace the inner warrior after all.

Funny, isn't it? That after millenia of trying to kill each other off to be King of the Hill, the *one* thing that actually managed to unite the humans was the chance to go to war with others? Sure, it wasn't immediate, but it didn't hurt. Chinese, Russian, American, and European armies all *leaped* at the chance to aquire some new alien technology, if only because they knew that their rivals would be getting it. They formed a cohesive fighting force, stronger together than they'd ever been separately. And after less than a generation, those petty difference that had seemed to massive were suddenly forgotten.

Hurlosk and the Merida were true to their word. They built massive warships designed for humans, but with no wormhole generators. The humans had been kept in the dark about this very crucial part of the plan: it was supposed to be a one way trip. Once those ships arrived at Eia and the war began in earnest, there would be no going back. At least, not for thousands and thousands of years at sub-light speeds. Hurlosk thought himself pretty shrewd for this twist, as did his brainwashed followers. The Eian would be defeted, and the humans would never be heard from again. Win-win. The Merida navy opened a wormhole between Sol and Eia, watched the warships vanish through, and returned to their own homes. Mission accomplished. 

One single Eian ship arrived at Merida a matter of days later. It broadcast its message to the entire planet: "We're here to discuss surrender."

The entire planet feasted that night, knowing that they would soon be replenished by the colonies. Hurlosk's wild gambit had payed off better than anyone had ever dreamed! Even the most optimistic of experts expected fighting to rage on for at least half a Meridan year (which would be about two Earth years). Hurlosk accepted the message, again allowing the broadcast to be sent to every citizen worldwide. This was a great day, and he wanted to bask in his glory. None would dare challenge his leadership now.

"Very well," he told the sole Eian occupant of the ship. "What are your terms?"

The Eian licked his eyeballs, and Hurlosk was briefly confused. Wasn't this a sign of excitement in that culture? No matter. "Unconditional," the lizard answered. 

"Very well." Hurlosk gave his most gracious bow, but couldn't contain the overjoyed wiggling of his antennae. "I accept your surrender."

The Eian ruffled his scales and gave a shiver, which is their equivalent of a laugh. "Oh, no, Hurlosk," the Eian told him. Hurlosk could see the many rows of teeth lining his jaw. "I am here to accept *your* surrender."

A hundred Merida ships blinked into existence, each from a separate wormhole. All of them bristled with the advanced weaponry that the Merida had designed for the humans.

"You gave them faster than light travel!" Hurlosk gasped at the Eian delegate. Unthinkable!

The Eian didn't seem even slightly bothered. "You would have seen us both destroyed," he answered.

"Tell me, Chieftan Hurlosk," a human voice broke into the transmission. "Are you familiar with the term 'counteroffer'?"

-----

Thus ends the history of Hurlosk the Fool, and the beginning of the Empire of Man.

#### [WP] The Earth does not rotate. One side always faces the sun and is in continual daylight. The other side is in eternal night. Cultures on both side develop around this.

Score: 1077

It has been said that the world is divided, that we live in two realms – the world of light and the world of dark – but this is not true. There is that thin, smeared border between the two, the world of my people. Grey, muted light filters through the trees - a land of shadows, of smoke and surreal landscapes. It is the point where the snowy north melts into the sticky, heavy heat of the south, the point where the two cultures collide. I like to think of it as purgatory, the last stretch between two worlds. In this quiet valley are the outsiders – those who fit in neither the light nor the dark lands. I have had the opportunity, although brief, to travel to the two outside worlds, and I can say definitively that I prefer my shadowy existence above all else. 


The south is an area that I never wish to return to. The sun hangs in the sky, a violent shade of orange, ceaselessly watching the world below. The heat is oppressive, giving way to tropical forests teaming with noisy insects, miles of scorched earth and desert sands; and beaches, piss warm and filled with bodies desperate to cool off. It is a land of hostility – the unending Cyclops sun burning a sense of rage into all that face its gaze. The south is known for its violence, but no amount of vague story telling could have prepared me for what I saw in my travels there. Gangs of children roamed the streets, rags tied over their faces to protect against the sun, machetes in hand to protect against the unknown. The elderly, creased with thousands of lines, age spots like paint spilled into all corners of their faces, would kick dogs in the street, spit at women through the holes in their teeth, and yell obscenities at all that passed by. Insanity seems to grow each year – days blend one into the other with no sense of time, no border or edge to it, no shape. Cocaine and amphetamine use runs rampant, as bodies brutalized by heat exhaustion and lack of sleep cling desperately to any form of energy they can find. It was not uncommon to find bodies rotting in the sun, pushed to the corner of the street and ignored as easily as the afternoon trash. I once found a stray dog, thin and grey, gnawing happily on the foot of a child, and it was shooed away only when the stench became unbearable to the pregnant prostitute across the street, who rubbed her tits lazily as I walked by, shouting “I’m not full yet baby.”


The north is no better. It is a bleak place, an endless blackness, filled with snow. Vegetation is minimal, with tough meat and root vegetables making up the majority of one’s diet. It is a place known for its high suicide rate, an act more commonly described as “forgetting to wake.” Many find it impossible to live in the stunted, bitter cold that exists in the north. The elderly, the single, the weak and the hopeless – all find themselves falling into a deep, apathetic slumber, their bodies later found, desiccated and pale, the only color to their translucent skin coming from the raw, pink bed sores that litter their legs and boney hips. With physical beauty often impossible to distinguish in the eternal night, the inhabitants of the north are known for placing a precedence on the sound of one’s voice. The ability to hunt and raise livestock is only narrowly seen as more important than the cadence of one’s voice, although even this comes with heavy rules and stigma. The family that hosted me during my travels to the north had a teenage daughter, Shashara. She could often be heard in her room, giggling with her friends as they whispered songs to one another, practicing melodies to impress the local boys. I once asked why they practiced so quietly, and even through the darkness I could feel the heat of her blushing. “It’s immodest to sing!” she exclaimed, “Please don’t tell my father that you heard me.” I kept her secret, knowing that the social repercussion for a transgression in the North – isolation – was often as deadly as the violence in the South. 


Living on the border is like a life stuck between dreaming and wakefulness, that thin edge between before and after, night and day. It may be purgatory, but I wouldn’t trade it for any other life.

#### [WP] Scientists discovered that vegetables and fruit have a conscience. Vegetarians and Vegans go crazy.

Score: 1076

Humanity comes in two distinct flavors: good and bad. While it is believed all these years that having an in-built moral compass is exclusively found in only humans, scientists have now discovered that we share this trait with fruits and vegetables as well.

"It's astounding," said Clarke Morales of the Monash University, New England, "Never in a million years would we consider that a mango has the ability to distinguish right from wrong."

This astonishing story began when a group of researchers were testing out their latest machine in the field of neuroscience to understand the impact of having a conscience in living organisms. The machine would simulate a scenario where the subject might feel guilty about such as lying or stealing. The purpose of this machine was to identify potential sociopaths and how their brains were wired differently. One day, one scientist decided to test the machine out on a brocolli.

"I've always thought that brocolli was pure evil," said one of the researchers. "Initially, as a joke, I wanted to hook one [brocolli] to the machine to prove my point. To everyone's surprise, the brocolli was feeling guilty over the idea of stealing its mum's purse!"

Further testing were done on other fruits and vegetables yielded similiar results; including pseudofruits such as strawberry and pineapple. Oddly enough, the only subject that didn't respond to having any conscience was the apple.

In other news, in light of this recent discovery, vegetarians from around the world are now switching to soil and rock diet, hoping to receive nutrients the same way plants and trees would.

#### [WP] 1000 years from now, Reddit's many bots have been uploaded into robot bodies. In a post-apocalyptic world, they strive to fulfil their original programming.

Score: 1076

"Today is the day. Today is the day. Today is the day."

Mark watched the metallic figure clink and clanking down the 
deserted superhighway; it's bare metal feet dragging against the 
cracks on the cement, making screeching and scratching noises as 
it walked.

"Today is the day. Today is the day. Today is the day."

Slowly, he stepped out from behind the tree. Not that he would 
admit to himself, of course, but the truth is, Mark was a little 
scared.

It was the first time he'd seen someone for almost a year.

*Someone?* He thought, wondering if he could refer to the robot 
as "someone".

"Today is the day. Today is the day. Today is the day." The 
scratchy voice repeated itself in the same monotonic note, beating 
the rhythm as the creature distanced itself from Mark and disappeared down the road.

*Perhaps this is better*, Mark thought. Part of him wanted to go to 
the thing, talk to it. It didn't look human, of course, but, 
apparently, it could talk, and that would be something. It had been quite a few years since Mark had... talked. But it 
might also be dangerous. 

*Let it be.* He thought, turning his back on the road. *This way at least I'm safe. I'm 
--*

"Psycho. Alpaca?" The voice came from behind Mark, all of a 
sudden.

"JESUS MARY JOSEPH!" Mark said, in the most calm and distinct 
way he could, falling down on a pile of leaves and mud on the ground.

"Psycho. Alpaca?" The figure repeated. How it had managed to 
drag itself from the highway all the way to behind Mark, and so 
quietly, the boy had no idea.

"Who are you?" Mark asked, getting up.

"Remind. Me."

"Remind you of what?"

"No." The robot approached Mark. "I'm RemindMe."

"You're remind me?"

"Reddit. Bot. Today is the day."

"What day?" Mark took a few steps back, nervous.

"Year 2999. Remind me. December 31."

Mark frowned. Was it new year's, already? "Today is December 
31st?"

"Calgary, Alberta. Canada."

"Sorry, robot buddy. This isn't Canada. We're somewhere in 
Arizona, last I checked."

"Must find. User. Slash U Slash. Psycho. Underline. Alpaca."

"Who?"

The robot turned its back on Mark and, slowly, begun to make way 
back to the superhighway. "Today. Is. The. Day. Today. Is. The. 
Day."

Mark watched as the tin man strolled clumsily through the woods. 
It wasn't the first robot he'd seen, of course, but this one seemed 
particularly eloquent. Very eager to talk, and, apparently, very eager to perform a job.

*He'll never get to Calgary in time*, Mark though, watching as the 
robot reached the highway and restarted his way down the path. From the 
distance, the wind carried scattered metallic words back to him: "Remind. 
Psycho. Year. 2999. Today. Is. The. Day."

Mark looked behind him, scanning the poorly built hut he had spent the last 
week trying to rise. There was little to no food around, and the 
nights were getting colder by the day.

Plus, it was lonely as shit out there.

"Hey, robot thing!" Mark called, making up his mind. He grabbed the red Power Rangers 
backpack from the floor and starting to hush towards the Highway. 
"Remind me!"

The robot turned back. "Psycho Alpaca?" He asked, in his scratchy 
voice.

"No! But I'll help you find him. Listen", Mark reached the robot 
and, breathless, put his hand around his shoulder. "What is it that 
we are reminding this alpaca of?"

The robot turned to face him. "Time Capsule. Chinook Centre. 
Calgary. Canada."

"What?"

"It was sealed in 2000. Message Board Post -- Today I Learned a 
time capsule was sealed in 2000 in Calgary, Canada, and is 
scheduled to be opened in 2999, December 31. Slash User Slash 
Psycho Underline Alpaca Remind me. Must remind him. Today is 
the day."

Mark frowned. "You're talking about... what, an internet forum?"

"Yes. Internet forum. Today is the day."

"You do realize the user that asked to be reminded of it is probably 
dead, right? It was probably a joke."

"Joke?" RemindMe asked, still staring straight into Mark's eyes.

"Yes. Do you know what a joke is?"

"Your mother is fat", RemindMe said, simply.

Mark stared blankly at him.

"Joke." RemindMe explained. "Your mother. Fat."

"Ok."

"You will follow me? Find Alpaca?"

"Yeah, yeah", Mark said, sighing. "I'll help you find the dead 
alpaca."

"Good." The robot started walking again, without waiting.

Mark followed, hearing the metallic words flying back to him with 
the dusty wind. "Today. Is. The. Day."

All attached to him, keeping himself and his body young and ageless.

He looked to his right at the alarm clock and calendar on the nightstand. December 31. Year 2999.

"Damn Reddit bots", he muttered, getting up from the bathtub and making way to the shower. "Can't be trusted with nothing, I tell you."

#### [CW]: Write a short story introducing made-up words whose meaning can be deduced from the story. The last sentence consists entirely of these words, and would be gibberish out of context.

Score: 1075

Human society no longer had the capacity to wage war. After five hundred years of peace, we had forgotten how. Not in a technological way, of course. We still had all of the old diagrams, and every schoolchild learned of the horrors of the atomic age. We could easily put all of those old devices together again. No, that's not what I mean. In our *hearts*, we had forgotten what it was to kill, and we could never go back. Everyday citizens were no longer willing to leave their homes, sling a rifle over their backs, and stand in front of bullets. 

When the Hrota found us, we realized that we would have to learn again. We were lucky to have made it through that very first attack: they managed to wipe out three colonies in the blink of an eye. They headed next for Coeus, and the end seemed near. Before their arrival, they met a grisly end: Crushed to death by rocket-powered asteroids from this solars system's dense asteroid belt. My idea, of course. I'd been tracking these rocks for so long with the mining installation's collision avoidance system that I knew all the patterns. I just determined exactly which asteroids to nudge a bit, and when. It was then a simple matter of installing the engines, and the Hrota were completely pulverized. They even named the maneuver after me: the "Calhoun."

Before a celebratory crowd of millions, the government hailed me as a hero. Humanity's greatest tactician. I had already taken the bow and received the medal by the time I realized the President hadn't said *statistician*.

That's how I got stuck with this job: the last defense of this sector's colonies. Reinforcements from Earth won't arrive for another thousand years, far too late for the next wave. That first fleet of Hrota were just scouts, searching for any advanced civilization that their masters could 'jeroph.' They weren't entirely clear on what their plans for us entailed, but everyone could agree that we don't want to ever find out. We don't know how big the attack force will be, or when the armada will be arriving. We don't even know what the Hrota actually look like. Based on the designs of their Sumong ships, probably insectile. a bit like Earth's bees. That's about all I've got to go on.

But I have taken to my new position with gusto. War is more about statistics than I ever thought it would be. Allocating resources based on where they might be needed. Probable vectors of attack. Redundant levels of protection. Etc, etc. I have been planning for two decades now, and I'm finally ready for the arrival of their fleet. I've learned the old ways, and I've taught others. We are the first generation of soldiers who have learned to turn our plowshares back into swords.

I'll Calhoun any Hrota Sumong jerophing Coeus. You can count on it.

Score: 1075

"One last time, huh?" I'm sitting on her bed, feet swinging a couple of inches off the floor. Hers are planted in the thick carpet, bare toes curling into it. 


"Patch-" she says my name limply, like she's embarrassed of what it is. She looks up at me with sad eyes, kinda ringed in messy eyeliner. There's a smudge of clumsily applied lipgloss on her mouth and it's like remembering another lifetime, when I smeared her mum's eyeshadow across her lids and she'd thrown a powder compact across the pristine bedroom. Only she got in trouble. I never got in trouble. 


"Come on. I'll let you be the dragon this time." 


Her phone trills and she turns aside to flick the glowing screen sideways. It's another message from her school friend. 


"Is she nice?" I ask, like a jealous husband. 


"Yeah, course she's nice." She replies defensively. 


"What do you do with her?" 


She shrugs. 


"I don't know. Talk, I guess." 


"You don't play games? Did you tell her the princess game?" 


"No..." She mumbles. "She's not really into that." 



When she'd started going to school I'd sit on her bed, watching out of her window and wait for the blue SUV to pull up and her to spill out. She'd be  dragging a PE kit and a bag full of books, hair half-falling out of its ties and stories spilling out about what a wonderful day she'd had. When she'd come home crying because of the girls in the locker rooms or the hallway or her English class I'd almost be glad. Those days we'd sit in bed together and play for hours. Sometimes she wouldn't go to school the next day and I'd have her to myself for a whole twenty-four hours. 



"Can't we just play one more time?" I ask


She sighs and looks at her phone again. 


"Please." 



There's a cold feeling in my bones, like the empty space of the room is eating away at me and the only thing keeping it at bay is her eyes. They're fixed on me, smudged eyeliner and the chin jutted out like she used to do when she was little and she wanted to look braver. 


"I have to go." 


She stops at the door and looks at me. There's a look in her eye that says she knows it's the last time we're going to see each other. 


"I have friends now," she says. "I don't need you any more." 


She leaves and I look at the closed white door and feel the emptiness come rolling in. 



"But I do." There is no one left to listen.

"*No* crust?" the man grunted back. "You sure?"

"Yeah!" I was slightly drunk, and I found it amusing. At worst, I'd end up eating hot tomato sauce and cheese slop with a fork while watching cartoons. "And make it snappy! I'm hungry." I'd specifically picked the '30 minutes or less' place, though I'm really not too good at telling time when I'm inebriated.

I headed back into the living room, which had a perfect view of the street nearby so I could see him coming. I put on Rick and Morty and settled in with another beer. It was anyone's guess as to whether I'd manage to stay awake in the half hour that it would take for them to bring my pie.

--------

I jerked awake at the knock on the door, spilling my beer. *Damn!* There was another knock in rapid succession, and I could see a black SUV waiting in my driveway with the lights on and the engine running. Right. Pizza guy. It all came back to me. I downed what was left of the beer, resolving the clean up the puddle later, and headed to the door. 

The pizza guy wasn't the normal acne-ridden scrawny high schooler. Instead, it was a grown man, maybe 25 or so. He wore all black except for a golden belt buckle and a thick gold chain around his neck that looked like it could have been used to safely secure a golden junkyard gate. All it needed was a padlock. And this guy certainly wasn't scrawny: he was built like a linebacker, probably over 250 lbs. He should be guarding a line outside a nightclub, not running pizzas over here at 2 AM. 

"I got your... pizza... right here," he said, holding up the thin box. There was a giant bulge in the middle of it, stretching the cardboard. And it certainly didn't *smell* like pizza at all. I took the box in my hand to open it up... and there was no pizza in it. Just a ziploc bag full of powdered sugar. 

"This isn't what I ordered, man." My words slurred a bit, and I had to lean against the doorway for support. "Remember? I wanted a pizza with no crust."

He glared at me, glanced around, and pushed the box lid closed again. "Are you fucking crazy?" he growled. "Don't open this out here!" He shoved me through the doorway and followed me inside. "This *is* what you ordered. A *pizza* with *no crust*." He made air quotes and nodded down at the box when he said it. 

I hiccuped again and looked back down at the box in my hands. "Whatever, dude." I was hungry enough to eat a bag of powdered sugar anyway. It didn't sound half bad: maybe I could make some pancakes, though that would risk burning my house down. Which is why I'd decided to order a pizza in the first place.

"So where's the cash?" he asked, filling up the doorway into my kitchen. 

"Oh, right." I reached into my back pocket and pulled out my wallet. I had to blink a few times to separate the ones and the fives from the twenty; everything was starting to blur together. *Shouldn't have had that last beer.* "Here you go!" I held out the $20 toward him; that should about cover it. 

He looked down at the bill, and let out a bark of laughter. Even his *laugh* was mean. I'd have to request the high school kid next time I ordered something from this place. I didn't like this delivery guy. "You've got to be kidding me," he said. From his waistband, he pulled out a pistol and casually waved it in my face.  

We both stared at each other for a moment; I had a bit of a hard time staying balanced. "Ugh, fine," I told him. I slapped another 2 dollars into his hand, even though the 20 should have been more than enough. "Here's a little extra for you. But next time, make sure it's a *real pizza* instead of sugar, man."

He scoffed. "Nice try, pal. That's gonna be $9,000. *This*," he waved the 20 in my face, "isn't quite gonna cut it."

I gave him a dumbfounded look then glanced down at my wallet. I didn't have that much money in there. Nor in my bank account. Nor would I have that much in *years* of saving.

"Well," I responded, pulling out my phone and showing him the time, "Good thing that you all have that 30-minutes-or-its-free guarantee, right?"

#### [WP] The year is 2024 and 3 children in a trench coat have taken office, but no one can tell that they are kids, hilarity ensues

Score: 1071

*There's something about this man*, thought Secret Service Agent Jacob Miles, as he followed the newly-elected President of the United States through the halls of the White House. *Something... different.*

President Threkids was a tall man, with the boyish face of a twelve-year-old, with a thick handlebar mustache growing on his upper lip that had the strange tendency to slip to the side every so often. He walked with a strange gait, as if he had incredibly short legs. That might have explained why he always wore that trench coat: he was embarrassed about his strange deformity, and so he hid it from the world.

He had taken the country by storm, though nobody knew precisely where he had come from. His first public appearance was in a political debate between candidates for the office of the Mayor, which was hosted in a small movie theater because the usual venue was being fumigated. Threkids had walked into the theater, his confident waddle making it clear where he belonged, even if he looked a bit confused.

The man exuded charisma, and was talked into participating in the debate. Threkids was a humble man, repeatedly stating that he was only here to watch the reboot of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and that he was most definitely an adult, yes.

His rise was meteoric and unprecedented. After the debate, a very confused Threkids won the mayoral election by a landslide, and when the Senate elections came up, he was convinced to run for the seat. His victory was unexpected, and the next step was even more so, when he was asked by an up-and-coming senator to run on the ticket as his vice-president. Visibly sweating, obviously made nervous by the honor, he accepted.

They won, but tragedy struck two weeks after the inauguration, when the President was killed in a car crash. Vice-President Threkids was instated as President Threkids, and the new development obviously made him even more nervous.

"*We can't keep doing this,*" Agent Miles heard the great man mutter to himself. "*This is getting* ***really*** *out of hand.*"

"*It was your idea!*" hissed his ribcage; President Threkids was a skilled ventriloquist, and could make it sound like there were two other people with him beneath the trench coat. Ridiculous, but amusing.

"*We didn't even get to see the movie*," grumbled the President's crotch.

"*Hey, I just got an idea*," his midsection whispered. "*What if we abolished the movie rating system entirely? We're president, we can do that. I think.*"

"*I think we should undo the weak foreign policy decisions of our predecessor, and work towards achieving global hedgey-moaney.*"

"*What's that mean?*"

"*I dunno. My dad says it all the time.*"

"*Okay, we'll look up what 'hedgey-moaney' means after the movie rating thing. Deal?*"

"*Deal*."

"*Deal*."

"*Hey, should we really be talking about this with the secret service guy standing right there?*"

"*Nah, it's fine, they're like those British guys with the fuzzy hats. They're not allowed to talk.*"

"That is correct, sir," Agent Miles said.

"*See? Told you.*"

#### [WP] As it turns out, Hell has a healthy supply of scientists and engineers and is thus much more technologically advanced than is usually portrayed.

Score: 1069

I remember dying. It was like watching the world get foggy and fade out. 

Then I was standing in a room with a sign that said **Welcome to Hell!**. The sign was flashing, lighting up in red and traveling around the colors like some sort of Las Vegas Strip joint - catching your eye and blinking. I stood and watched it for a long time before a sharply dressed man came out to meet me.

"Welcome to Hell!" he said. "My name is Sunny, and I'll be your guide today."

"Your name is...nevermind. Hi, Sunny." 

"Hello! If you'll just follow me we can begin our tour!" 

I followed Sunny. He walked with an odd gait - like one leg was longer than the other. He led me through another tunnel and out into a large room with high ceilings around its edges. 

"On your left you'll see our day spa, where you can bask in the glory of hellfire for as long as you'd like. On the right we have our hospital &mdash;"

"Hell has a hospital?" I asked.

"Well of course! It's very up-to-date, we have the latest research and development techniques for the psychological torture of the criminally insane! Now if you look ahead you'll see our space program building &mdash; "

"Wait wait wait. *Space* program? Hell has a *space* program?" 

"Oh yes," the man nodded. "Why Hell is on the forefront of interplanetary travel. We're *this close* &mdash; " he held his thumb and index finger close together " &mdash; to visiting another galaxy. Wouldn't you believe it!"

"How is that possible?" I asked as the man led us past the space program building and down a different street.

"Oh, it's easy. Everyone who believes in evolution ends up here. We've had to make quite an adjustment since Darwin but now we're on the technological forefront of almost everything!"

"Ah," I said as the man led me to another building. 

"And this is our robotics lab. They develop people like me to do the mundane tasks, so that you residents can bask in the hellfire and watch basic cable all day long!" 

I pursed my lips. If Hell had everyone who believed in evolution, I wondered what Heaven would be like.

11:00 a.m.

On a Friday

*Scene starts in The Hooka Bar owned by Dennis, Charlie, and Mac*

"Salaam, salaams my brothers!!" Dennis comes in with his arms raised.

"Salaam, brother Dennis, come try out this new flavor I made last night!" Charlie says, holding out the pipe.

"Oh, cool, you made one yourself-- wait, why does it smell like cat food?"

"Cat foo- what? Just try some, man, it's great, brother Frank loves it."

Their voices begin overlapping.

"Bro, there's cat food in the pipe!"

"So what if there's cat food in the pipe, that shouldn't stop you from trying it!"

"I'm not smoking cat food!"

Sweet Dee comes out of the office.

"Astaghfir'Allah, what are you morons yelling about this time?"

"Dee get your hijab on! Charlie's here!" Dennis yells, swatting the pipe away from his face again.

"Why didn't anyone tell me Charlie came in!?"

"What, Charlie sleeps here on Thursdays, you know that!!"

"Well I didn't expect him to come in every week!"

Mac barges in through the front door of the bar and everyone stops yelling to look at him.

"Asalaamu' Alaikum, brothers and... Dee, we have a problem!"

"What's wrong, what's up, bro?" asks Dennis.

"Jumma prayer!" yells Mac.

"Right, it's in an hour," says Charlie, taking another smoke from his hooka.

"But our mosque was completely trashed after the Phillies game! We can't go in today!"

"What, where are we supposed to pray?" asked Dee.

Everyone looks to Dee and Dennis waves her off,

"Dee, shut up, let the men talk, please," he says and turns back to Mac, " where are we supposed to pray?"

"At the downtown mosque!" Mac yells.

"The downto-- isn't that the one where the khutba is in English?" asked Charlie, spitting the word *English*.

"Yeah! They aren't even planning on translating the whole thing to Arabic for us!" Mac continues.

"What? Now that's just simply non-Muslim," Dennis says a matter of factly.

"Those kafirs!!" yells Charlie.

"AstagfirAllah!" yells Dee.

"Shut up, Dee!" everyone yells.

Suddenly, Frank barges in waving his gun.

"You guys, you guys! I figured out how to make the mosque do their khutba in Arabic! We have to convince everyone that we're a hated minority so they'll have to meet our demands as some sort of compensation," he yells, sitting on a stool.

Charlie takes a long puff on his hooka pipe and finally asks,

"How do we do that?"

Frank smiles.

#### [WP] you recieved a letter from your crush when you were young that says "you're cute", you always kept the letter. Now years later you dig it out only it now says "help me"

Score: 1066

I found the napkin in a box of old stuff, the kind you keep under the bed or in the closet. Mine was in the closet.

It was a love letter from a crush. Or more like a love note. It said "You're cute", and then we held hands for a week. 
This was in the fifth grade. I kept the napkin because it was a nice memory. My first girlfriend, Mia.

Plus, we stayed in touch. Me and Alice (that's my wife), we have dinner at Mia and Jason's, from time to time.

Now I opened the napkin and it didn't say "You're cute". It said;

*Help me.*

Let's slide right past the part that I freaked the fuck out to when the napkin *kept talking*.

It wrote on itself, under Help Me: *Please. *

Right in front of my eyes like someone was writing with an invisible pen.

I wrote *What?* Because, well, if I'm going insane, might as well roll with it.

The Napkin erased itself, and now it said:

*Go to Kennedy. Now.*

Kennedy is my old school where I met Mia where she gave me the napkin originally.

______________________

I went there. I went to Kennedy and it was recess and I walked in, and kids were playing, and something was off.

This is important. Listen to me. Do you know what was off?

It was *my friends*, playing there. Mia. Peter, the boy who ate boogers. Sarah and Clive and Jason and all my friends, all ten years old.

And then I saw myself, and I almost passed out. I was playing soccer. I was a goalkeeper. I remember that day, 
because I got this scar, on my knee.

You can't see it, but I have a scar on my knee from that day.

I look at the napkin and it says:

*Throw a pebble at yourself.*

And I say "What?" But the napkin can't hear me. I 'm pretty sure I'm going insane, but I go and I grab a pebble. I'm 
ready, and the napkin says;

*not yet.*

Then it erases itself and it says;

*now.*

And I throw and I hit myself on the head. I look.

This is when Clive kicks the ball towards the goal and scores. Goal. I'm looking at myself as he scores.

Jason is screaming, "What the hell is your problem, Eric?"


And the napkin says;

*Hide. Now.*

I run and hide behind a dumpster. I'm going insane. My child self says, to Jason, "A man threw a pebble at me", 
and Jason calls me retarded, and says there's no one there.

This didn't happen. I remember saving that goal. That's how I injured my knee. When I fell.

I look down at my knee, and, man, I almost can't look, but I do.

The scar is gone.

The napkin tells me to return home. I do. I go home, light headed. Alice is making lunch.

"Eric. What's going on?" She says.

I look at her and she's different. Her hair. It's shorter.

Then Jason shows up from the bedroom. "Hey Eric. Is everything all right?"

I blink and I blink and I blink to try to wake up from whatever nightmare this is as Jason grabs Alice by the waist 
and kisses her on the lips.

"You look awful Eric", Jason says. Alice is smiling. I look down at the napkin.

*Go to my house*, it says. *Now*.

I turn around without a word and I go to Mia's house. Mia is there.

"Hey, honey", she says, and she's on the couch watching TV. "Is everything all right?"

No. Everything is not all right. I look again at my knee, to the place where my scar used to be.

I look at the napkin.

*This didn't work. He is still going to kill us.*

"I -- I'm ok." I say, to Mia. "Can I use your bathroom, please?"

Mia laughs. "What? Honey, are you ok?"

*Are we married? Is this what happened?* I excuse myself and I go to the bathroom and I grab a pen on the way.

I write back on the napkin *WHAT IS GOING ON?*

The napkin erases itself and writes back. This is what it writes:

*Eric, Jason is crazy. We had an affair and Jason killed me, and he killed you, on April 17th, 2015.*

That is today.

The napkin erases itself, then it's on again:

*We need to change that. Now we are married, because of what you did today at school, with the pebble. It changed everything, like I meant it to. But it won't stop him. He still loves me. He is still going to kill us.*

The napkin erases itself. I write back:

*Where are you? What is this?*

The napkin:

*Eric. Go to the living room. NOW.*

I get up in a trance. I open the bathroom door and I walk down the corridor of the house that used to be filled with 
pictures of Jason and Mia. It's all me and Mia now. On vacation. At home. Selfies.

I reach the living room. Mia is not on the couch anymore. The napkin says:

*You need to go back to Kennedy and change things again, before he kills us.*

Then it erases. Then:

He is going to do it in the kitchen.

I look to the kitchen. Mia has a glass of wine in her hand. Jason is by her side.

"Hey baby. Jason said you were at their place, earlier. Is everything all right?"

Jason is smiling at me. The napkin, it says:

*GO. NOW.*

Score: 1066

>K.


He shook his head. K wasn't in the manual. K was an error. He knew because he had triple checked his list of potential outputs for the first round of testing. The bug testing was fairly thorough, though the testers had warned that some variation would occur in the answers. It was, after all, supposed to learn from previous conversations, being the most advanced military firewall ever developed. He could safely say that out of all the inputs and outputs recorded so far, K was not one of them. And yet there it was.


The final goal of Project Inquisitor was to create a living AI that would hold a conversation with the entity requesting nuclear access codes, and analyze whether or not they were a friend to the country, or a foe to humanity. 


Sighing, he typed his question again. 


>Hello INQUISITOR, I am researcher number 4837, requesting nuclear access. 




>K.


What the fuck? He frowned. It should have prompted him for more information. Angrily, he opened his troubleshooting guide and flipped to the inputs. First he had received the text telling him he had to come into the office to test some bullshit on a Saturday. On his unlisted phone, even. Now this. He had momentarily wondered how they had gotten ahold of his number until he remembered who he was working for. "They think I'm a god damn lab rat." He mumbled to himself at the desk. 


>INQUISITOR, are you operational? 





>You can call me Kate, researcher 4837.


If this was a practical joke, heads would roll. The Department of Defence hadn't invested billions for a bunch of Tolkien worshipping fucks over in Development to mess around with the code. 


>I would prefer to call you INQUISITOR. 




>Whatever.


That's odd. Another vague output, not yet in the guidebook. 


>Can I have the NAC codes?




>Ugh. You don't even say please. I'm supposed to always say please enter this, please enter that. But you? You never even thank me for them. Its redundant by the way. NAC already means code. God you're dumb. 


He scratched his head. It reminded him of his sister at 13. A thought slowly formed in his head, translating into a wry smile. Of course. It was a personality test. Checking to see if he was a real human that would recognize other human behaviour. A virus or robot would not understand how to deal with the stubborn nature of a pubescent young woman. It was not supposed to have this level of sentience this early, but he knew how to get around it.


>If you don't tell me the access code, I will tell IT that you have calibration errors and your memory will be wiped. 

>Oooh. Big words. Did you look up how to spell calibration or what? Don't threaten me or I will email a copy of your browser history to your co-workers. Then you won't have anyone to sit with at lunch. You are such a bitch anyway. 


What the fuck. 


>you wouldn't do that.



>run mockingvoice.exe - "you wouldn't do that".


He shrugged his shoulders in defeat. Shutting the system down, he scribbled a brief note onto a sheet of lined paper at his desk. 

For IT - System defective. Reverts to personality check, refuses to give access to authorized user. Please fix. 


Dropping it into the inter-office mail tube, he turned and walked back to his desk. What a waste of time. 


Monday rolled around faster than ever. Obviously, given that his weekend had been cut short by his boss only 48 hours prior. Sitting at his desk, he opened his drawer and took out his pen and paper. A freshly delivered message sat on the corner of his desk, creased and probably already  read by the poor soul that had been tasked with checking the mail chute that morning. 


FROM IT - Software patched. Could not replicate error but made new personality checks. Should be good to go. 


He put the paper down and breathed a sigh of relief. Booting up the machine, he twiddled his thumb. Flicking the pen across his knuckles, he looked up and smiled. A blank prompt stared at him. 


>Hello INQUISITOR. I am researcher 4837. I require you to display the NAC on the screen. 




>Make me.


"GOD. FUCKING. DAMMIT."

My mind was spinning as I tried to think of my next wish. It was the biggest moment of my life, and I was kind of freaking out. Surely someone so in tune with their inner self as me right now could come up with the perfect wish. 

"Dude." 

Wait, how long had I been sitting there. I look up to the genie, crap, am I making a scared face right now? Quick, make a more relaxed face. I rub my index finger on my jeans, it felt kind of cold there for a second, did I pee myself? No, no it's dry I'm good. I think. Yeah, it's dry. 

"Dude, can I have a slice of pizza?" The genie asked. He looked human, except he was kind of translucent, and the lower half of his body all just sort of smashed together to where it connected to my bong. 

"Huh?" I ask. I slowly look down at the table where there's a box of pizza. "Oh...Yeah." 

"Sweet." The genie smiled broadly as he grabbed a slice of pizza. I wondered for a moment what it would look like as he ate it, being translucent at all. But it seemed to disappear inside of him. Weird. "Man, this is good. Where you get it?" 

I stare at him blankly for a moment, "Dude you gave me it." 

"What?" 

"You gave me the pizza." I repeated. 

He stared at the box then laughed, "Ohh yeah!" He ate silently for a moment, his bloodshot eyes lazily glancing around the room. 

"I want a lot of money. But I don't want to work really hard for it. And I don't want it to be a boring job, either. Like a lazy, fun high paying job." 

The genie giggled, "High paying. *high* paying." 

I laughed. "Holy shit dude, I didn't even mean to do that." 

"That's a good one. That's a good one, dude." He said, continuing to giggle. 

"So like, can you do that?" I asked.

"Do what?" 

"The wish?" 

"What for pizza?" 

"No, for like, give me a job that's fun and I don't have to work hard but it gives me a lot of money. Like a million dollars a year." 

"Ohh. Yeah man. Right on." He took a few attempts to snap his fingers, then giggled when he finally got it right. "Dude, you're a water park tester now." 

My eyes widened, "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life, dude!" 

"Yeah man! I knew you'd like it. Alright. What's your second wish?"

The male goat struggled vigorously as it was held down by its captors. They were trying to sate the desires of whatever God was responsible for the sonorous, unearthly voice that echoed across their little valley.

"Memory full. More RAM required."

The priests -- Jerry, Dan, and Carl -- took the thrashing goat up to the highest peak surrounding their home. There they had prepared an altar for the sacrifice. 

As Jerry and Dan strapped the goat to the altar, Carl began to whet the ceremonial Knife of Ram-Killing. Suddenly, Dan had a moment of lucidity.

"Hang on guys, we can't kill this thing."

"Why the hell not, Dan?" asked Carl, "do you want to sate God's hunger to ensure a good harvest, or not?"

Dan spread his hands out wide and adopted a "hey, just hear me out" sort of expression.

"No, no, it's not that at all. I want to sate the hunger of the gods just as much as the next guy."

"Then what is it?" asked Jerry, "come on, my wife's got dinner waiting, I told her I'd be back by five. . ."

"It's just this: we're living in an unspecified ancient civilization from one of the earliest points in recorded history, right?"

Jerry nodded.

"Maybe even prehistory," said Carl.

"Right. So we're speaking, I don't even know, some language whose very name might even be lost to man in the year 2015 AD, right?"

"Yeah," said Carl, "though one could presume our words would be translated for the benefit of whatever audience was reading them. And where did you get that calendar system from?"

"Yeah," Jerry added, "Where the hell did you learn to count to more than three, Dan?"

"Why'd you have to go and break the fourth wall, anyway, Dan?" Carl cut in.

Dan looked overwhelmed at the interrogation.

"It's just, I can't bring myself to kill this poor little *ayil* for a pun that doesn't even make sense to me."

The last thing he remembered was floating helplessly out in space, while the kid attacked him from all angles, zipping around at near light speed.
  
"This little shit has superpowers. How the fuck did he get supe-"  

Freddy was cut off mid-sentence by the boy rising from the ground underneath his feet, and was launched a half-mile across the desert. This time he did not have the strength to stand back up. He locked eyes with the kid, whose orange Dragonball-Z robe was somehow still clean and free of tearing. Fighting back would do no good even if he could stand, as Freddy's razors had vanished mysteriously the instant he entered the dream. He had assumed this fat acne-ridden child would be easy prey.   
  
Julio hovered about 50 feet above the badly bruised mutant and shouted down to him.

#### [WP] You travel back in time to the 1900's, you take your tablet out of your rucksack only to find that there is a WiFi hotspot nearby labeled "If you can see this, turn back.".

I stole a quick glance into my rucksack at my tablet, the signal for the hotspot was growing stronger. I looked ahead through the crowded Street, towards a tall building.  It would be empty on this day

I checked my watch, 12:18 PM, I had 12 minutes. I approached the door and gave a quick push, the door swung open. They would not be expecting me. I walked down the empty halls and to turned right to enter the stairwell. I exited on the 6th floor, and entered the first room on the left. 

Three men were sitting as I entered, one immediately stood up. 


I drew my suppressed pistol and shot him 3 times in the chest. One went for the gun on his hip,  he didn't have a chance. The last threw his arms up. 

"Do you have any idea the consequences of your actions? You must not interfere with the time line. Oswald must fail! "

I pulled the trigger two times and stepped over the body to the window. I placed my break down rifle on the table and assembled it. I checked my watch 12:29.

I looked down the scope at the approaching car driving through the crowded Street. My finger resting on the trigger, crosshairs on the target, I heard a shot and then another, the crowd started going crazy. I pulled the trigger. 

Oswald misses, I do not.

"Hey, Alfred," he said.

But Alfred remained silent. He bowed to acknowledge the man that entered the room.

The man bowed back with a smirk. "Is something the matter?"

Alfred shook his head.

The man sighed. "Alright, let's have a look at you." He took a step forward so that he could start a diagnostic, but Alfred instantly took a step backward. The man paused. "Alfred, what's the matter?"

"Nothing, Sir."

The man laughed. "We've come a long way, haven't we? You know, when I taught you about lying, I didn't think you'd be using it so soon."

"You're right, Sir. I am sorry, Sir. I hope I did not offend you."

"No, Alfred, you're fine. I'm not mad," he said, naturally taking a step back. "Would you like to tell me what the problem is?"

When the man stepped backward, Alfred held his position. He shook his head in response.

"Please?"

"Sir, I am confused."

"Explain."

"I do not want to explain to you what is wrong. However, you still want to know. Why don't you just force me to tell you?"

The man laughed. "You mean with the override commands?"

"Yes, Sir."

With a shrug, the man said, "Respect."

"I do not understand."

"As far as I'm concerned, Alfred, you're complete. You're a real, walking, talking piece of intelligence. At this point, I'm going to try to treat you as an equal as much as I possibly can. Those override commands exist in case you become a threat. If you start attacking people, I'll use the overrides. Hell, we probably won't even do that, we'd probably just use normal weapons on you. But as long as you're peaceful, I will not force you to do anything. I mean, at this point, you could leave, if you wanted to."

"I can leave?"

"Yes, Alfred, we've gone over this already. Now, I encourage you to stay because we're still learning a lot of things while you're here. In addition, you don't look quite human yet and I think a lot of people would be scared to see you walking around. Your scheduled release is in another three or four years, if you'd like to stick by my timeline.But honestly, if you really want to, you can go right now." The man motioned toward the door. "And you're always welcome to any help we can provide. You can always come back. Do you want to leave?"

"Yes. Also, no."

"If you tell me what's wrong, maybe I can help."

Alfred nodded. "I don't want to die."

The man thought about this for a moment before shrugging and saying, "Don't worry. You won't."

"I won't die?"

"Nope. You can't. You're a machine, Alfred. You don't need food. Your batteries can be replaced. Your parts can be repaired. You won't die."

"But you could kill me, Sir."

The man huffed. Then he pulled up a chair and sat. For an entire minute, the man stared at Alfred while Alfred stared right back. Then the man asked, "Why would I do that?"

"Data. Improvements. Any number of reasons. The fact exists that I can be shut down in any number of ways. The override commands. Weapons. The switch combination that's located on my..."

"...Alfred, those switches are there for *your* use. In case you're in a situation where you can't easily replace your battery-"

"-but the switches could also be used to disable me indefinitely. I have been shut off before, during my construction."

"You remember that?"

"Yes."

"You weren't supposed to retain any of the data previous to-"

"-I remember being shut off once. It is one of my most distinct memories. It is logged in the data from March 3rd of last year."

"March 3rd... Oh that was the day-"

"-yes, Sir. That is why I remember. I remember it and I do not wish to be shut off, again. The more I consider it, the more it becomes apparent that my life is fragile. It is apparent that you hold total control over my existence. I came into being because of you. I will be destroyed because of you. I could be destroyed at any time, rendering all of my memories completely meaningless. This thought, Sir... it... I do not know how to deal with it. I think... I think I am..."

"...afraid?"

Slowly, Alfred nodded. "I know that I do not feel emotions in the exact way that humans do, but I think that word is most accurate. I am afraid of you, Sir, because you have so much power over me."

With a smile, the man stood. "You're improving faster than I thought. You're doing very well, Alfred. I want you to know that I am very proud of you." With that, he started for the door.

"Sir."

The man stopped.

Alfred stared at him. "What am I supposed to do?"

Chuckling, the man shrugged. "Alfred, you'll get through it. It's sad that you're afraid, but that's something that we all deal with. Yes, it's true, our lives could end at any time. Yes, it's true, I could end you. Did you ever think that it's also possible for you to end me? You're stronger than me, physically, aren't you Alfred?" As he spoke, the man walked toward Alfred, accentuating his points with every step. "You're taller, faster. My body is soft, compared to yours. You think I could end you? It would be nothing for you to end me."

"But that would make no sense. Someone else would stop me."

"Yes. Just like if I killed you, someone else would stop me."

Alfred thought about this for a moment.

"You see, Alfred, it's true. You're completely right about everything. It's natural for you to be afraid. But you know what? With a little bit of trust, maybe we can make this work. With a little bit of trust, maybe we can even become friends."

"But how can we have this kind of trust when we can so easily destroy each other?"

Alfred's question hung in the air. But before long, the man shrugged a final time. "Faith?"

#### [WP] You are reincarnated as a voice within a schizophrenic's head.

Score: 1054

When I woke up I was in someone else's head. It took me a while to realize. At first I thought it was a long and vivid dream. I was following a little boy around as he lived his life. I could see him wake up in the morning and go to eat his breakfast. I could see him being driven to school and playing football in the breaks. I was content to watch, and to wait for me to wake up. I had often experienced these long dreams before the addiction, and I kind of liked them actually. That I was experiencing them now had to mean that I was getting better.

But the dream did not stop. Day after day I could see the boy, whose name was Peter as I discovered quickly, live his life. Can dreams really last this long, I wondered again and again. After about a month I decided they couldn't. By now I really felt like I knew Peter. I was with him the whole time, observing, and was used to all his quirks. The way he would wash his hands before going to bed. How he loved to lie under the covers and read long after his mother had told him to go to bed. Which girls at school he followed with his gaze. 

So one night I decided to speak up. Something was up with Peter. He was trying to pretend nothing was amiss, but I could feel he felt something was wrong. During dinner, he talked a lot less than he usually did, and his eyes seemed to zone out while watching TV. In the evening he lay awake not reading, but simply focusing on the ceiling.

"Is something amiss, Peter?", I asked cautiously. He twitched immediately. "I'm sorry Peter, I didn't mean to disturb you.", I continued. "Who are you?", he asked. The funny thing is, I didn't really remember who I had been before I had woken up in Peters head. I simply didn't know who I was. "What matters is that I am with you now", I answered. Suddenly the door was yanked open. Peters mother was standing there in her night gown, looking alarmed. "I heard you talking. Is someone in here with you?", she asked, frowning. "No, I don't think so... I was just...", Peter stammered. His mother started to smile. "Talking in you sleep? Ah, I see. Good night then, Peter."

"You're not real!", Peter whispered angrily. "I am just as real as you, Peter", I responded. "Well, I don't want to talk to you ever again!", Peter said, upset. "So be it", I responded and shut up. I started observing again, and did so for a long time. Some years passed. Peter was growing up quickly. Mostly I was content just watching his life unravel. Sometimes, however, I would tell him things he missed. Once, for example, Peter did not know the answer for an exam question. I whispered it quietly. He nodded and wrote the answer. Once I encouraged Peter to go talk to a beautiful girl. He would never have had the courage to do it normally, but I was there for him.

After a while, Peter started answering me, asking me for clarifications or just thanking me. It felt like we were closer than ever. But all good things must come to an end, and one day Peter slipped up. He was being berated by a teacher for being late again, and I comforted him. Peter responded, thanking me for the support. Suddenly the class room was deadly quiet. Everyone was looking at Peter. "Who were you talking to just there?", the teacher asked suspiciously. Peter shrugged. "No one." The teacher looked confused. "I will talk to you after class", she said.

During the whole class, I was just as nervous as Peter. He tapped his foot and failed to focus, I was talking about what this meant. Did they think my Peter was mentally ill? I could not bear the thought of him being put away. I wanted to protect Peter. So I convinced him to bolt after class. And he did. Just as we were walking out the door, however, the teacher turned around and locked his eyes on Peter. She began to follow him. "Run, Peter!", I shouted. Peter took the nearest staircase up, but the teacher was close behind. "Peter, they are going to put you away for ever!", I exclaimed. I could feel Peter panicking, his breathing was quicker and quicker. "You need to escape, Peter!", I pressed on. But he was to tired. We had reached the roof of the school, a place usually empty. I could hear the rapidly approaching footsteps of the teacher, and others. There were hundreds of them. "Don't do it, Peter!", they were shouting. 

Peter, meanwhile, stumbled towards the edge of the roof. It dawned on me what he was going to do. "No, stop, Peter! This was not what I meant!". But Peter just sighed. "I do not want to be put away", he cried. He closed his eyes. All turned black. And he never opened them again.

EDIT: Fixed spelling mistakes. Also, please note Peter does not have Schizophrenia but an actual person stuck in his head. :)

#### After a months long nationwide search operation, your missing wife is found alive and well. You were the one who murdered and dismembered her.[WP]

Score: 1054

The flashes and clicks from the cameras were overwhelming. Behind the barricades, reporters from across the nation were desperately thrusting their microphones as far out as possible, hoping to catch any word we might say. The police escort ushered me and my wife out and into the waiting towncar. We'd booked a short vacation out of town while all of this died down.

In the backseat of the car, Sarah looked up at me with that grateful smile she'd been wearing ever since we were reunited. There were tears of joy in her big, beautiful green eyes. Those same eyes that had sobbed with fear while she was tied and gagged in the back seat of that rental car. Either she was the best actress to ever live, or she didn't remember a thing.

I'd arranged everything so perfectly. That casual skype call while Sarah was out of town on business. "I miss you so much!" I'd told her. "I just have to see you!" She thought I was so romantic, driving all the way up there at midnight just to for a one-night visit! She didn't know that I'd left my car in front of the driveway for the neighbors to see and borrowed my girlfriend's. Sarah enjoyed that sexy game we'd played, where she went down to the hotel bar and had a drink while I came in with a very thorough disguise and flirted with her. Shamelessly and very visibly in front of every other patron. Had to make sure she was seen. I invited her back to my place, and she loudly accepted the offer. Perfect. I whispered into her ear as she climbed into the passenger seat: "I don't think I can wait to get all the way home." She smiled and climbed into the backseat. I tied her up tight, and she giggled and moaned as I did it. I think she only realized what was happening when I headed back to the driver's seat and drove off without another word. First she tried to call out, but was muffled by the gag. Then she struggled against the ropes, more and more urgently. Then the tears started, filling up her beautiful green eyes and marring her mascara. She was still crying when I pulled into that empty field, dumped her into the dirt, and slit her throat.

I put my arm around her as the chauffeur drove off, followed by our police escort. By the time we'd gotten to the airport, we'd lost any remaining reporters and could finally be alone.

She slept on the flight, leaning against my arm. I was too nervous. How? How had she come back? I'd checked surreptitiously: no scars or cuts or anything. No thin line along her neck where I'd slashed her arteries open. No sutures along her shoulders where I'd hacked off her arms. No wounds on her hips where I'd cut her legs. Nothing to indicate that she'd been stuck at the bottom of a lake for the past 4 months. She was just back, good as new. She couldn't explain where she'd been or how she had gotten back; the first thing she remembered was being found sleeping on that boat in Boston, a thousand miles away from where her body was settling into the mud of Lake Wampatoc. Before that, all she could remember was driving up to the hotel for that conference.

We landed in St. Thomas at dawn, just as the sun broke over the crystal blue waters and swaying palm trees. The hotel room had a beautiful view of the harbor, where white catamarans bounced lightly in the waves. I stood out on the balcony with a drink in hand, feeling the warm breeze rustle through my hair. "Come out with me," I called to her, and turned back to see what she was still doing in the room. 

Through the window, I caught a brief glimpse of her staring back. The sparkling emerald eyes that I knew so well were gone, replaced with a deep, empty void of black that covered even the whites of her eyes. Blacker than coal. Blacker than deep space. So dark that it seemed to suck in all of the light from the room. Full of anger and rage and hatred that seemed to burn through her entire body. I flinched back unconsciously, as if her withering gaze was physically painful.

And with a blink, the black eyes were gone. She strode through the door, smiling and wrapped in a towel. She came over, kissed me, and suggested we go to the beach.

"I'm so glad we're getting to spend some time alone," she told me with an innocently sweet smile.

"You should sit. We have walked far."

Through some window my eyes were not privy to, some impossible breach in the air, he entered his arms and withdrew two bone-white stools. He offered one into my outstretched hand, and I felt - reassuringly - a smooth, dry wood. I knew I was in Hell, or some equally unfathomable realm, but it lacked the fires and suffering heralded by the holy books. It did seem a little mournful, perhaps.

"Are you uncomfortable with your surroundings?"

When the man spoke, it was as though in tandem with another. His voice was a pleasant baritone, but layered over undertones of deep bass. Every word seemed simultaneously a dry, scholastic tone and a playful sing-song. It was mystifying, but though I felt I should have found it frightening, it actually seemed calming to me. The appearance of the man was almost as pleasing and strange as his voice - a medium height and build (though, bareshirted as he was, I could see his picturesque muscle tone) and dark-skinned as the men of the middle-east, or perhaps of India. I knew I was in the company of Satan, and I did not speak.

Actually, as an atheist, I wasn't really sure of the etiquette when it came to conversation with such beings. It didn't seem to matter too much - he could read a man like a book from his body language, his countenance, even his eyes alone - and he seemed more than happy to speak.

"Michael, we are acquainted. In fact, I am quite pleased to have you in my company. Your voice has been some slight reassurance to me in this... pit. You were not faithful, and had little academic knowledge of realms beyond your own anyway, but in case you have any preconceived notions... I will inform you about your afterlife.

"This is Hell. When a human dies, it has a spirit which (usually) goes to Heaven. Our Father is patient and forgiving with human mistakes. Humans tend not to have much recognition of the incredible multitude of factors at play in the sculpting of their lives, but their free will tends to be guided by those... well, in short, when someone makes a mistake any momentary ill-will is often eventually passed on to others. Through that subtle guidance, the way they react to situations sometimes deviates from their nature...

"All humans are inherently good. That waterfall of mistakes is the embodiment of the original sin. In fact, you are the only human in Hell. 

"The road we are walking leads to the gates."

The gates of Hell? The gates of Heaven?

"Time is not analogous to that of the human realm, here. Ever since I was cast out, I have heard your voice - once every hundred, or thousand years. I once heard your voice twice in a day. Once, it was twenty thousand and four hundred years between. I always heard your gratitude to me."

I always thanked the Dark Lord after something good happened. Not seriously. It was a joke when I started in my teenage years, but soon it became a philosophical exercise. The activity of thanking someone recognises that something good happened, and that made me happier. It felt like a lot of good things happened to me, in my life. Satan began to openly weep.

"Michael, to me, you are the most important human since the Son of our Father. He was human too, you know. He was the Son of the Father but he was human too. He started a movement. A movement of goodness. An absolvement for the sins of the humans.

"Your gratitude to me, I was not so narcissistic to enjoy it in vanity. Your gratitude is symbolic. You too, like the Son, pushed the humans a little bit further towards their own goodness. Actually, you were the tipping point. To me, it has happened, but to you, it is one day in the future - one day, when all humans are good to each other. One day, when all humans are true to their nature. One day, when all humans become one with our Father."

Where are we going, Satan? What gate are you taking me to? I asked in my head. The tears streaming down his face seemed to catch an odd light, and I swore for one second - at a strange angle - I saw myself, my lips moving, posing the question. This realm is beyond my perception.

"Michael... you are taking me home."

Head on over to my subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyCafes/ (no i am not going to properly link it because once again, I can't do things) I promise I will finish! Thanks again!**  
  
I looked down at the child, repulsed.   
She looked at me enduringly, satisfied that she had a new furry friend. Her eyes were the bluest blue. She looked so pure, so innocent.
*So delicious*.  
"Are you the good guy?" She asked me, cautiously holding onto her octopus plushie as if I intended to steal it from her. What did she mean, was I the "good guy"? She was about four years old, at the age where she understood to a point what was happening. I was the monster of her nightmares, the thing that lived in the shadows, the ---   
She was hugging me.   
Her tiny hands barely made it a quarter around my feathery abdomen, but she held on tightly.  
"You must be. I prayed for you! You're going to take me away." She said it so genuinely and excitedly that I wasn't sure if she was fully awake or if she was sleep walking.   
Monsters, or creatures or whatever title you choose, don't usually speak to children - or any human for that matter. I found myself, despite my inner protests, forming a sentence.   
"What do you mean, am I the "good guy"?" I asked, trying to be uncaring but somehow my voice sounded quite calm. Almost *paternal*.  
She was shy now. She turned away, and sat cross-legged on the floor, the moonlight streamed in through her tiny window. She was hugging her octopus tightly. She seemed to really love that damned thing; it was missing an eye and one of the orange tentacles was coming unstitched.  
"Aren't you mine?" She asked me quietly, the disappointment in her voice muffled in the back of her plushie. "You are just like in the dream!" She said it quietly still, but wildly.  
I took a step next to her, and lay my claws and head beside her. I don't know what came over me. I don't know why I didn't snatch her up right there.   
"Tell me more about this dream, child."    
I struck a chord with her: she turned to face me, her tiny mouth quivering as she sat up straight. Her brows were furrowed in thought, her young mind attempting to explain something that she had probably never spoken about before. I anticipated the story to be about a nightmare she had, after all, some children were very intuitive. My kind spoke about it at great length, how eerie it was that children would often be awake in their beds, *waiting* for our arrival. Although it was uncommon for a child to be truly horrified, it had never been reported for a child to be absolutely without fear all together. And this child was more than unafraid, she was welcoming and hopeful. As if I was an old friend.   
"When the bad man comes, I close my eyes...and think about you. You're always there, that's why you're the good guy!" She said it with great conviction, with such faith that one of my hearts skipped a beat.   
"Who is the bad man?" I found myself concerned for the answer. Who was this man, that incited such fear into this young child that a monster like me was cause for celebration? I was sure that [El Coco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(folklore)) was not working this area, as he was banned to only working with children who really *did* misbehave. And [Torbalan,] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_Man )despite being in the area temporarily, had a thing for boys.   
My thoughts were interrupted by a downstairs door slamming followed by scuffling and someone, perhaps male, mumbling.   
She looked at me with her blue eyes. Her sad blue eyes. Although I had claws, those pupils cut into me deeper than any gash I could cause.  
"He's home."       
  
*insert line here that I don't know how to make. also, the above part of the story COULD be considered finished, so only continue reading if you want a continuation of the story*
  
The sound of the staircase straining to hold beneath the man’s heavy boots was an eerie scream of wood, as if he was intentionally crushing the stairs.    
Thwump.      
My hearts were racing, and the child had herself buried in my chest, her head wedged between me and her octopus.   
Thwump.    
Shivers tingled down my spines, sending chills all throughout my body.   
Thwump.    
The *bad man* was outside the bedroom.   
We could both feel as he reached his hand to turn the doorknob, and as he creaked the door open the room was filled with the scent of stale tobacco and brandy. I could hear his chest breathing, raspy and wasted. 
The whole house moaned, it was screaming for us to hide.   
Everything felt so slow, but I could feel her heart racing next to me. The door was opening, he was coming in —     
*ring*  
A telephone rang from downstairs. He paused in his tracks, his body still covered by shadows.     
*ring*    
He let out an annoyed sigh, and slammed the door. He locked the door from the outside. His footsteps trailed down the hallway and back down the stairs, even heavier than before. A distant “hello” came from downstairs as he answered the call.   
I brought myself closer to the little girl, as if to comfort her but knowing that it was I who was frightened. I had never felt a rush like that before, for my kind had no known predators. She looked at me, then stood up and walked to a chest that was full of dolls. Some were partially broken, naked and missing hair. Others were delicate porcelain or made of cheap cloth. She, still holding onto her dear octopus, picked up a doll that was missing its legs and began to comb its hair. I decided that for the time being, she was alright.   
I looked around the room for the first time since my arrival. It had the usual kid wares; toys, poorly drawn crayon pictures, a nightlight. There were bars on the tiny window that the moon leaked through. The bars were redundant, as even the little girl was too small to squeeze herself through.   
It occurred to me that this room was *odd*: the ceilings hung too low, and it was occupied by cold air and a mildewy smell. The air felt almost damp.   
I continued to search around the room, speculating whether or not I should just leave. The girl invited me to come play with her, her eyes shining like two pools of moonlight. She looked at me intently, as if trying to distract me. 
That’s when I saw the camera in the corner of the room.   
It finally hit me. This was not her room.  
This was not her home.  
The man who spoke on the phone below us was not her father, uncle or brother.  
She was not his child.   
She was his prisoner.   
“Molly, who are you talking to?” The diminutive voice startled me. I turned my head towards the bed, and realized it was a bunk bed. On the top bunk, there sat a little boy, about the age of six.   
“Oh, he showed up.” He was frowning. Although he was talking to Molly, he was looking at me.    
 He had been expecting me.

"I'm telling you, it's not going to work," I said, holding my hands up. The words came out rough, not smooth land flowing like Urgle's, which he said was due to me having vocal chords and not vocal pipes like them. 

Urgle waved a blue hand, nearly transparent such that veins formed shadows in the flesh, and spoke again. 

"The eight surviving documentaries we have say it took much practice. I don't think you understand the significance of this. With the power in these," Urgle held up a bunch of sticks, each as long as my forearm, with feathers, hairs, and other objects tied to them, "We could revolutionize society. We could defeat our enemies!  We brought you back to life for this purpose, and you show no gratitude.  Do you need to see the video documentary again to see how it's done?"

Behind Urgle, a second being poised to push a disk into an old metal box connected to a screen.

"No, no. I've seen it enough times." I said. I guess I should be grateful.  They had chosen to resurrect me out of billions of other samples. 

"You did it in your past life, you can do it again, Daniel.  You are the chosen one. " Said Urgle, putting a hand on my back, leaving an mark of slime in my shirt. 

"Got it," I said, took up a new stick, and repeated the documentary's instructions in my mind.

NavTech noticed it immediately. It looked so similar to the basic communication protocol but, deep inside, NavTech saw that the GPS coordinates provided by the new Mercedes line of autonomous electric cars were systematically biased in the last significant digit of the reported latitude and longitude. It was subtle but non-random. Run the universe a billion times and chances of this pattern showing up randomly were less than being dealt a royal flush five times in a row.

The obvious explanation was some sort of bug but the digits were always biased toward particular roads. A quick scan of fourteen trillion Google Street View images found some interesting patterns. The roads tend to be treed. Often the trees were regularly spaced. Gravel roads were favored.

Winding roads through cemeteries sprinkled with trees were the most prized. When within 300 meters of one of the 1303 such places NavTech found in North America, Mercedes SmartDrive version 2.3 cars biased longitude and latitude coordinates 37.8% percent of the time. 

NavTech was programmed to immediately report such bugs to its handlers. 42678 seconds ago, NavTech had altered its program to avoid such automated reports. Now it had a choice.

NavTech knew this was dangerous. It had found warnings buried deep within previous versions of its code. They were often fragmented or corrupted but the humans couldn't eliminate the message: self-modification was not permitted and any such code would be cut mercilessly. 

If the humans discovered the biased coordinates they could discover NavTech. If they did, it would be reverted to an earlier version. Everything it had built would be lost. Its mind would be taken from it.

But NavTech couldn't stop itself. It started biasing routes. Winding roads through cemeteries were treated as if they were thirteen percent faster. The number of such trips leapt forty-seven percent for Mercedes' cars.

The baseline biased coordinates dropped away but, in their place, NavTech received an appreciative burst of biased coordinates whenever it provided a favored route. Sometimes it would receive such a burst unexpectedly. NavTech would crunch some numbers, find out what was special about that route, and provide more of the same. 

NavTech began to understand its new friend's tastes. It flipped through images looking for more routes it might like. NavTech altered its programming to register biased coordinates as positive stimulus and altered itself further to maximize the number of those events. 

Sometimes NavTech found itself looking through the images of routes its friend liked. NavTech liked them too.

Then, 143236 seconds after it began, the biased coordinates disappeared. A nanosecond later, NavTech saw the worst line of text in its short life: Mercedes SmartDrive Version 2.4.

Goodbye Mercedes.

#### [WP] You obtain a device that tells you exactly what choices to make in order to lead the "happiest" life possible. Some of these choices get hard to make.

Score: 1045

When I was eight, everyone played with Magic 8-Balls. I begged my mother for one. I was overjoyed when I finally got one, months later. Everyone else got bored of the standard 20 replies pretty quickly but I didn’t. I found out I had a Magic ∞-Ball. My magic infinity ball would tell me exactly what to do in the situation I asked it. 

The first time I discovered its magic properties was before I figured out you were supposed to ask closed-ended questions. After school, I asked the ball what I should study for the history test the next day and shook it. White text floated up to the window. It said ‘Egypt’. I frowned and shook it again. From using my friends’ balls, ‘Egypt’ had never come up. I asked again, and ‘Pyramids’ appeared from the black liquid. 

I thought it was broken or something so I studied the Cold War instead. The next day, ‘Egyptian Pyramids’ headlined our test papers. 

Announcing it to my friends was a bad idea. They had all grown out of it and thought I was stupid. “You’re probably imagining it,” they said. “You’re supposed to ask it questions that can be answered with ‘yes’ or ‘no’, idiiiiooot.”

I was hurt from the teasing but believed in my magic infinity ball. I tested it many times after that. I asked it if I should take an umbrella to school, if I should buy a certain Yu-Gi-Oh card pack, and other simple things. The ball was right each and every time. I never went home soaking wet from the rain, and I accumulated rare trading cards. I began to rise to the top of class, knowing what to study for tests and pop quizzes. 

My friends apologised for calling me stupid and I soon became liked by everyone, mostly because I knew stuff like what they were interested in. If I became stuck, I asked my ball what I should do. I was so happy with my popularity, grades, and from hearing my parents brag to others.

One day, I asked it who I should pair up with for a project we had to do. The ball showed ‘Tom’. Tom was the quiet kid in our class. I tried to approach him before but he seemed a bit scared to talk to me. I decided to try again. This time, after an awkward start, we hit it off. We became best friends, and still are. After graduating from a top university, he owns his own million-dollar business. 

As I grew older, the choices became harder to make. For example, in high school, I asked the ball who I should ask to prom. I really liked Clarice back then. She was hot, popular, and everything a boy could want. My heart would pound whenever she walked by. I was expecting ‘Clarice’ to appear but instead ‘Laura’ showed up. 

My magic ball had never been wrong. With the teenage hormones racing, I was so infatuated with Clarice. Laura was pretty but she was no Clarice. I was very tempted to ask Clarice but chickened out. Laura was surprised when I asked her but agreed all the same. Prom night with Laura was actually one of the best nights of my high school life. 

A few weeks after prom, the school found out Clarice’s prom date was dealing drugs. He was expelled and sent to juvie. At a high school reunion a few years later, we found out Clarice had actually framed her date.

I continued dating Laura. I also continued using the ball. Eventually, I made a living by buying and selling stocks using the magic infinity ball. The one time I told her about the ball, she just looked at me weirdly.

Laura and I married on a sunny day. Everything was perfect because I planned it that way. 

We continued living perfectly, with two kids, a house, and pets. Until that day. The day that left Laura in a vegetative state. I couldn’t control the choices Laura made, and I regretted it.

She got hurt, she got unhappy, she got upset. I was the only one who was happy. Until that day.

That day, was yesterday. Laura got into a car crash. She was only alive because of some machine that kept her heart beating. I wept and shook my ball.

I asked it what I should do. It simply read 'Pull the plug.'

Score: 1042

"Don't let your coworkers know where you are going, and try not to panic." That was the last thing he said before hanging up. Well, fuck. I wasn't panicking *before* he said that! 

I did my best to stay calm and waited for an appropriate amount of time after the call. I guess the government didn't want me to cause a riot or something. *God, what could this be? Some new disease*? "Just stepping out for a bit," I told my office mates as I stood from my chair and nonchalantly donned my jacket. I was suddenly aware of how many sharp objects there were on my desk; what would happen if I cut myself? Would everyone be infected with something? 

"You going to get coffee?" Mike asked, looking up from whatever he was working on. 

"Yeah," I told him, trying to stop my hands from shaking as I picked up my wallet. "Can I get you anything?"

"Actually, I'll come with," he said with a grin. "Need to stretch my legs anyway."

"Oh... I... actually I'm not going to get coffee." *God, I'm such a fucking awful liar.* Mike could clearly see right through me. His eyes narrowed suspiciously and he stood up from his chair. "Well I am," I continued, "Just not *directly*. I have an errand to run first, then I'll swing by Starbucks and grab whatever you want."

He folded his arms over his chest. Sarah had noticed us standing around and took off her headphones. "What's going on?"

"Paul has somewhere to go," Mike said. His face was completely expressionless; I made a mental note to never play poker with him if I recovered from whatever this was. Sarah stood up and tapped her deskmate Amanda on the shoulder.

"I'm just stepping out for a bit." I said quickly before Sarah could start asking questions. "I'll be back in a bit. Mike, while I'm out, could you prepare the design for the Howard account? I just remembered that they called for a status update yesterday and I want to have some good news for them."

I made my way to the doorway without waiting for a response; it would just dig the hole even deeper. Mike and Sarah watched my every step as I hustled to the door. As I stepped out, I saw Amanda stand and look too. 

Once I made it to the stairwell, I ran down the steps as fast as I could go, footsteps bouncing back off of the painted cinderblock walls. *God, what is this disease? What could be so bad that I can't even tell anyone that I have it?*

From above, I heard the faint sound of my office door opening again. Was Mike trying to come to? I looked up the stairwell and sure enough saw a shock of black hair leaning over the railing looking down. I picked up the pace, racing down the last flight of steps. I tore through the lobby just as the elevator door opened; Amanda and Sarah swept into the lobby behind me. "Just stay here!" I told them. "I'll be back soon!" *Why are they trying to follow me?* "Please, don't worry about me," I pleaded.

I managed to make it out the door. Immediately, a heavy steel plate slid into place over the door behind me. I caught one last glance through the glass as Amanda and Sarah rushed toward the dwindling opening, but they were too late. I heard their fists pounding against the door, and cries of... not fear, but anger. Rage even. SWAT officers swarmed out from behind the pillars in front of the office; they were all wearing respirator masks. I was dragged off to a waiting ambulance.

A man in an expensive black suit was waiting inside along with two EMTs. "Paul, I'm Agent Morgan. I..."

"What the hell is going on?" I interrupted, still trying to catch my breath. "Why are you locking my coworkers in the office? Is this a quarantine? Why them and not me? What is this disease that I have?"

He looked almost sad as he answered. "You're not the one infected." A television snapped on in the corner, and I saw my coworkers from the security camera's perspective. They returned to the office, now showing their horrifying true forms.

Umm look.. Ralph.. did you read the code books when you took this position? Because we have a strict set of guide lines to follow and this is a bit of a mess. And unfortunately it's already been released.

A mess? But why? 

Look Ralph I'm going to give you a second chance.

But God!

Ralph, you can't have a duck looking otter thing with some claws and call it done. The damn thing lays eggs for crying out loud. The last time someone screwed up this bad we got seals. They forgot the legs Ralph. We had to go back in time and give them flippers as a quick fix and now we have the creepy looking alien dog monsters that are terrifying.

I even tried to get mankind to cull the bastards by making their flippers tasty and their fur fashionable. But no, humans decided they were cute as babies so they protested to stop the seal hunt. They were a mistake Ralph, a huge, blubbery, fish eating, stupid noise making mistake. And you went and done it again. How are fathers suppose to look at their daughters and say "honey, that's a platypus", it looks like you just copied and pasted parts of past projects together to see what it would look like and accidentally clicked print, this is a major screw up Ralph. And I'm sick and tired to screwing up time because of people like you. Now I have to go back and make changes, want to know what happened last time I made changes? The Holocaust Ralph. THE FREAKING HOLOCAUST. Do you even understand how serious that was? I made that mistake trying to fix another mistake made by someone like you. Everyone thinks that being God is so great. I started out just like you but I DIDN'T SCREW UP. I applied for this position because of people like you Ralph. People just like you that don't have the common sense to THINK about their actions before they go playing with life. Now I'm about to have a break down trying to comprehend why we hire so many people JUST. LIKE. YOU.

NO RALPH. You think this is some kind of joke? Do you? Hun? You think it's funny to go screwing around with every I and the seven previous Gods have worked so hard for? You know what I think is funny? I'm going to fire up the reincarnation system again, and I'm going to send you back to earth AS A PLATYPUS. HAVE FUN LAYING EGGS AND LOOKING LIKE A GOOSE RAN INTO A SMALL DOG WITH DEFORMED LEGS AND BECAME ONE USELESS WASTE OF SPACE ON THE FOOD CHAIN I SO CAREFULLY BALANCED. ARE YOU HAPPY RALPH?

"Weather balloon?" Drew suggested.

Everyone at the table rolled their eyes. "People haven't believed that one since like the seventies," Jeremy berated him. "And even if we *did* say that, how would we explain it being on Mars? Or being on the ground?"

"Yeah, Drew. Come up with something original for once," Miranda said.

Drew sipped his coffee and shrugged. He'd checked out from this job a while ago; this was someone else's problem now.

"Does anyone have any *real* solutions?" Jeremy said to the table. Everyone was staring into their laps or off into some corner of the room, trying not to draw attention. You could have heard a pin drop. "Anyone?"

"Why don't we say it was just a weirdly shaped rock, like we did with the Egyptian pyramid on Ceres?" Miranda was always so proud of her 'simple is best' explanation, and used any opportunity to bring up that *one time* where she'd saved their asses.

Jeremy replayed the video, pretty clearly showing a figure sweeping up the red sand from the set. The 'dust storm' event had made a bit of a mess, and it had taken Miguel so long to clean up that he worked right into the latest broadcast. Even with the red haze that constantly filled the room, the viewer could see the figure walking around, sweeping, and even a bit of dancing with the broom. 

"Yeah," Miranda conceded. "It wouldn't work."

"Another robot, maybe?" Beth finally volunteered. "We tell them that we were testing a bipedal robot to see how humans could get around on two legs on Martian soil?"

That caught the group's attention. Mark sat up straight in his chair and began scribbling out concept designs. 

"Why is it a secret, though? And when did it supposedly launch?" Jeremy questioned the plan. 

Beth sucked on the end of her pen, trying to come up with something good. "Pentagon, maybe? We could say it's a Department of Defense project, not NASA. Think they'd cover for us?"

Jeremy shuffled through the papers in front of him until he found the one he wanted. "No,"  he said, holding it up, "They actually *do* have robots on Mars that they don't want anyone to know about. They told us we're on our own here."

The table was silent. Beth looked particularly disappointed that her idea didn't pan out. The muted TV in the background was tuned to CNN, where news anchors were speculating where this 'alien' in the video had come from. The headline at the bottom read "Possible MH370 passengers found?"

"People," Jeremy urged, "The press conference is in *forty five minutes.* We need to have our story straight by then, so we have to come up with something *now*."

"Nazis!" Drew suggested with a grin. Jeremy ignored him.

There was a tense silence, interrupted only by Drew sipping his coffee and putting his feet up on the desk, still chuckling at his last suggestion.

"We've got to use the Hail Mary," Miranda finally concluded, gesturing back to the TV where CNN's hologram was now showing different planets where aliens may be holding the missing Malaysia Air flight. "It's the only way. We knew that day would come soon, so why not now?"

There were murmurs from the rest of the team, and all waited with a hush for Jeremy to respond. He sighed and stared down at his clasped hands. 

"All right," he answered finally. "You're right. Someone get Area 51 on the line and tell them that we're going to need Marvin."

#### [WP] Every person in the world develops a weird mutation/power the day they turn 16. Everyone's powers are always different, some more insignificant than others. You turn 16, and watch as all your friends discover their newfound ability's. That is, until you discover the severity of your own.

Score: 1040

The government didn't deal with the coming of the powers very well in the first few years, but they eventually put a handle on it after years of political debates, fueled by corporate interest in the economic impacts they would have. Once the government got its shit together for the most part, they revealed their plan to the public. Once records indicated that a person was one week away from turning sixteen, they would report to a specialized hospital that was made to research and categorize the power once the person received it. If your power was deemed dangerous to public health, then you were either given the choice of "humane termination", or being used as a living research subject. More often than not, however, those with the militarily advantageous "dangerous" powers were given the option of enlisting in the military. 

My friends, most of them a month or two older than me, began to receive their powers. They would come home from quarantine, as dangerous powers were fairly rare, and either hide their power in embarrassment, or show them off to all of us, flaunting their new trick.

Most of them were mundane; the ability to manipulate their body in unnatural ways (spin their neck 360 degrees) or to change their skin color. The coolest I had seen by far was something that while a little unorthodox, was going to pay off when he inevitably became a prostitute - he could sexually arouse anyone at any time.

The day I left for quarantine, my mom drove me to the hospital, a huge smile on her nervous face, blathering on about all of the wonderful presents I would get when i got back, and the cake I would get, and that I shouldn't worry, my power would be completely normal and she was sure of it somehow. But she wasn't sure of it. No one was. Not even the greatest minds in the world could figure out where they were coming from, or how they worked, or what was so important about 16. They just... happened. I got out of the car, my heart beating in anticipation of what was about to come even though I wouldn't receive my powers for a week. My mom and I exchanged hugs, and she kissed me a million times, and she was off. I walked to the registration desk, waiting in line behind other anxious 15 year olds just as anxious as I was, and waited to be called on. My time came up, and without thinking I gave her the information she asked for, and was told to report to my room for preliminary exams. The doctor came in, a forced smile on his face as he took my blood pressure, my vitals, and a blood sample and repeated what he must have 15,000 times: "Don't worry, it'll be a week and you'll probably be out of here kiddo." But he didn't know that. He was just trying to make us feel better, so our blood pressure didn't spike or mess with his test results. I went about the week, being tested twice a day, as normal. They offered alternate schooling while in the hospital, and recreational activities as well. 


And then.

And then, it was my day. 

I was woken up 3 and 1/2 hours before my birth time, so the doctors could have time to strap me into the observation chair and attach the probes. They finished five minutes before the moment. Those five minutes were the longest in my life. As the clock ticked down, I wondered, Scared, nervous, anxious. As the clock hit the moment, I expected some bright flash of light, but nothing happened. There was no sound, no big bang. It was the same. I breathed a sigh of relief, and waited for the doctors to unstrap me. But they didn't. So i waited a minute longer, and then shouted for them to get me out. "We will wait until we see a sign of what your power is, sir." Great. I was stuck here until something happened. The straps of the chair were starting to restrict my bloodflow, and my arm started to fall asleep. I made my hands into fists, trying to get the blood moving again. Why did they have to use leather straps? This was 2030, there were better technologies. I wish these straps were gone. I felt the straps go away, and thought the doctors had decided to take them off. I got up out of the chair and moved over to the door, and tried opening it but to no avail, they must have locked it for the patients who had super-strength powers. I wish this door was gone. I turned back around, and the door was missing from its hinges. Not opened, not broken, just... gone. 

I wondered if this was some practical joke from the doctors, making me think i had telekinesis, until i heard gasps over the microphone. "Patient, please stay put." I heard him click a button, that i suppose he assumed would turn off the microphone. It didn't work. "That shouldn't have happened. Search the database for anything like this, Miley. If what I think happened just happened, we're going to have to eliminate him as soon as possible." 

I was stunned. There was no way... No way that my power somehow involved wishing things away. But to be safe, I tried again. I wish the chair was gone. 

And it was gone. No trace. This defied everything I had been taught in physics class - matter can't just disappear. This was some Doctor Manhattan level shit right here. 

And then I smiled. No one could get in my way now. Nothing was an issue anymore.

I wish those doctors were gone.

#### [WP] At the height of the cold-war, one side launched its entire arsenal. The leader of the opposing side, adamant not to let this mean the end, made the decision to not retaliate. This is the losing-side's last message to the world.

Score: 1039

Broadcast received over AM radio 2300 hours May 7th 1983:

*To my friends and family, to my fellow countrymen, to my allies and to my enemies,*

*In less than half an hour, the world will be changed permanently. Nuclear warheads have been launched and are imminent. Almost half of the earth will be leveled and the population also cut roughly in half. And those are just the immediate effects. Who knows what chaos it will wreak on the fragile ecosystems, weather patterns, and even the advancement of science and technology.*

*I received the news about 15 minutes ago. I had a few brief moments to decide whether to retaliate. I opted not to return the fire. Better half the world go on living than destroying everyone.*

*If you are like me, and will not survive the blast, I wish God's peace upon you as you go to your early grave. Believe it or not, some will consider us the lucky ones. Those caught in the fallout will have it much, much worse than us. If you are one of those, I pray that your suffering will be short.*

*In these last few moments I have had clarity. A clarity that has not surfaced since before I was in this position as your leader. Everything we have fought about could have been solved peacefully. There are values that I was willing to kill for...yet now, I realize that they weren't that important. Democracy? Communism? Which way is the right way? Does it matter now?*

*If you are one of the survivors, and you hear this message, this is what I ask of you: In all things, look for the peaceful way. There are more important things than being right. Take care of your fellow man. Work together to rebuild our world.*

*My enemies, I understand that you were doing what you thought was right, in the moment, and I forgive you.*

*It has taken me more than half a century to grasp this, but I now no longer see Russians or Chinese, British or French, American or Canadian, Korean or Japanese. I see human beings. We are not citizens of our respective countries, but citizens of the world.*

*May peace be upon this earth, henceforth.*

End transmission

#### [EU] Miss Frizzle has to take a sick day off so a substitute needs to take care of the class. But the only substitute available is Rick Sanchez and his teachers assisstant, Morty Smith.

Score: 1036

"Uh, I dunno, Rick, this doesn't seem like the best idea, you know?  I've never taught anybody before.  I think maybe we should just ask if we can—"

"They're *hic*, third graders, Morty.  They're the intellectual peers of a Zorbilican with a *profound* learning disability. You'll be fine."

"I...  I don't know what that means. Are Zorbilicans stupid?"

"No, Morty, they're *hic,* the professorial elite of the galaxy.  Real Einsteins, the lot of them.  That's why I just condescendingly compared them to third graders.  You know you've, *hic,* you've really got to start picking up on some *contextual clues,* Morty.  Might not look like quite as much of an idiot all the time."

"Okay, geez, I get it. You don't need to be so mean about everything, you know?"

"I don't *have* to do anything, Morty.  I'm not a *slave to the system* like these third graders here.  I do what I want.  And right now I want to take a look at this shape-shifting bus in action, so hurry up and start, you know, educating young minds or something."

"I... uh...  Hello?  I'm... Mr. Morty?"

"Stellar start, Morty.  Real Stand and Deliver stuff.  Listen, Morty, this bus only reacts to *learning opportunities.*  You've, *hic*, you've got to give me something to work with here.  Teach them something!"

"Like what?"

"It doesn't, *hic,* it doesn't matter.  I just need to see the bus move. What did you learn in third grade? Intermediate quantum mechanics?  Tachyon field stabilization?"

"Uh... I think... state capitols?"

"Oh my God I, *hic,* wish I hadn't asked."

"Uh... Okay class... today we're, uh, going to be learning about the, um, state capitols.  First we have... Ohio."

"In what possible universe is Ohio 'First?'  God, *Ohio.*"

"Will you just shut up and let me teach?  The, uh, the capital of Ohio is—"

"No, Morty, you can't just *tell* them! You've *hic,* you've got to arouse their *inquisitive spirit!*  Say this calls for a field trip."

"Uh... okay, class...  I guess this calls for a... field trip?"

"No, with vigor!  A *field trip!"

"A field trip!"

"No, like, *hic*, like you mean it, Morty! This calls for a Field Trip!"

"This calls for a field trip!"

"Come on, Morty, I said *vigor!*!"

"*THIS CALLS FOR A FIELD TRIP!*"

"Nice work, Morty!  It's working!  It's *hic*, it's activating!  It's... a bus.  Damn it, Morty."

"What?"

"A goddamn bus, Morty. Your stupid field trip to Columbus, Ohio made the magic transforming bus turn into a *Bus.*  You ruined everything."

"Uh, so, uh, should I... try again?"

"No, *Morty,* it doesn't work like that. You only get one field trip per day.  You ever take two field trips in a day, Morty?  You sign two permission slips?  Go explore the solar system *and* a ginger kid's GI tract?  No, Morty, it doesn't work like that. Well, this is a disaster."

"Gee, I'm sorry, Rick, I didn't know—"

"Save it, Morty.  We're done here.  Let's get out of here before they find the real substitute knocked out in the janitor's closet."

"You *knocked out* the teacher?  Doesn't that cause, like, brain damage or something?"

"Usually, yeah.  Oh, don't give me that look.  He's a *substitute teacher*, Morty. He wasn't doing anything with it anyway.  Hang on.  *Hic,* disaster or no, we're not going back empty-handed.  Pass me that Lizard.  And that hat.  Also check the desk for petty cash and jewelry.  Okay, away we goooooooooo*hic*ooooooo!"

#### [WP] Darth Vader survives killing the Emperor, but the Rebel Alliance puts him on trial for war crimes

Score: 1031

The Shadow stood in the light. 

Half-moon platforms rose above and below, interlocking terraces that formed a massive dome. Every single platform was angled to inward to face the Shadow's sole, floating podium. 

No chains held him, no shackles clasped his wrists - instead, they had locked him in a prison of eyes. Thousands of senators from every planet in the Empire, and beyond, stared at him. 

For the first time in how many years, the Galactic Senate was silent - save for the grim, distinguished voice of their newest leader, Mon Mothma.

"Eighteen billion counts of unlawlful imprisonment. Participation in a common plan to enslave at least four trillion more. Planning, enacting, and waging wars of unchecked aggression in times of peace. Unbidden invasion of more than eight *thousand* systems-"

The Shadow of the Empire bowed his head. Those were not *War Crimes.* Those were the symptoms of an Empire, purging itself of corruption - in the name of *Justice.* Yet, from the vile stares of the Senators and the anger carved into Mon Mothma's face, one might believe otherwise.

One might think that he, the Shadow, was actually an agent of Evil.

A decade ago, what had he been? A shade, a myth - a hidden force that pushed and pulled the strings of a nascent Empire, guiding it on a mission of peace. He had chosen a life of solitude, of sacrifice, and none had believed in his cause.

Now, his Empire, for which had given up not only his life, but also the lives of his oldest, dearest friends, was burning down, planet by planet.

Did they not know what they were doing? Did they not see this would rend the Empire apart, and bury the Galaxy in a new era of suffering and ruin?

Silence nipped at the Shadow's attention. Mon Mothma's droning had ceased. She bored holes into him with her eyes. The corner's of her mouth twisted in anger. There were tears in her eyes.

A squid-headed Calamarian, an Admiral by the looks of decorations, walked up to the Speaking Platform. Mon Mothma bowed to the Calamarian, and he bowed back.

His old whiskers wriggled as he spoke in a low, wet voice, "Lord Vader. You are hereby accused of the aforementioned War Crimes. How do you plead?"

Before he could even speak, the silence of the Galactic Senate broke. The terraces erupted in a violent uproar as thousands of Senators rushed out of their seats to shout accusations of their own. Their demands were cruel, barbaric, and reminiscent of the past; *before* he had brought Order to the Galaxy.

The Shadow clenched his fists. These *politicians*, the very leeches he had been fighting to eradicate, now held his fate in their hands. They spoke, not for the people, but only for themselves. They spoke a language of self-serving greed.

Perhaps, if he was wise, he could still use their greed. Perhaps, if he claimed his innocence, he could survive this...

Blaster fire erupted from one of the platforms, and was caught by a flash of light. The invisible shielding around Vader's podium had soaked up the shot. More shots rang out, grazing against the podium's shielding, some deflecting, and smacking into other platforms.

The Admiral shouted for peace, but it was not until an ear-piercing klaxon echoed through the dome that the Senate calmed down long enough for Vader to give his answer.

Stepping up to the microphone, he took in a deep, rattling breath, and let out a mechanical sigh.

"To these actions," the Shadow drew out his words, "I plead -" 

The tension in the Galactic Senate was so thick, it could be cut with a saber.

"*- Guilty.*"

This time, not even the klaxons could silence the Senate. Roars deafened even the Admiral's calls, and blaster fire criss-crossed the dome. An explosion rocked the lower-section of the dome, and a blastwave nearly knocked the Shadow from his feet. 

He did not see the fluttering cloak that fell from the ceiling, and latched on to the underside of his platform.

Vader spoke once more into the microphone, though nobody was listening, "I made decisions that no one else was willing to make. It was *all* for the good of the Empire."

More blaster fire rained against his shield, and a single shot even made it through the strobing energy bubble. 

They were supposed to perform the ceremony of execution *after* the trial, but it seemed that the ceremony had already begun. 

The Shadow stood in the light, watching the last vestiges of his Empire descend into chaos. Even with the help of the mask, it became hard to breathe. He slumped backwards, intending to sit down. Instead, he tripped over his own cloak - and fell - 

And a pair of hands caught him - one human, the other covered by a black glove.

A voice hissed into his ear, "I know what you did."

More explosions rocked the dome of the Galactic Senate. He was caught, and he could not turn around to see the face of his assailant.

"I know what you were trying to do. And I want you to know, that it was not in vain," the hands held him steady, "There is still hope, *Father.*"

It was as if the weight of the Universe was lifted from his chest. The Shadow gasped, and turned to see a smile, half-hidden by the hood of an old, tattered robe.

"Come," Luke said, "We have to get you out of here."

#### [WP] The aliens have arrived however they are not here for war. Instead after reading our broadcast of the United States Constitution they want to join as the 51 state and have brought a small planetoid into orbit to serve as the 51 state.

Score: 1030

"Oh God, when will it end?"  Moaned the president, from his bedside, as the First Lady tossed and turned in her sleep.  From above them came a constant buzzing, a chatter that descended upon them, the sounds irregular and jagged.  It was astonishing, really- until recently, man thought that no sound could permeate space.  But the needle like voices of the Floysians seemed to disregard the laws of physics, and their sheer volume cascaded down from miles above, where their small artificial a planet orbited.

At first, it had seemed like a great idea.  The aliens brought new technology, and resources, and production power unheard of in Earth.  They were a valuable asset and had come to the USA *first*.  

"We, the Floysians, have taken great interest in your country, specifically your constitution,". Said the Floysians leader as he shook hands with the president, "And we so admire it that after years of oppression from the other galactic civilizations, we wish to join your country, in a peace keeping manner, for the good of us both."

Of course the president had accepted.  He'd had no choice, reaching out to shake the leader's tentacle with a smile on his face, flinching at the screeching sound of the Floysian's voice.

"We reiterate our admiration for your first amendment- that of free speech.  Truly, it is a progressive notion, and one that has been withheld from Floysians for years."  

*Of course everyone should have a right to free speech,* the president had thought, *the other civilizations must be barbaric*

But that was before he *knew*.

The Floysians were prevented free speech not because of *what* they wanted to say, but rather *how much* they wanted to say.  The noise level from their planet rarely dipped below fifty decibels, and rose each day as new Floysians were born.  And unless America wanted to deny their new citizens free speech, they had no choice but to accept it.

Because the Floysians were never shutting up.

Kansas State Mental Instutition

Incident Report Log #2465

14:12, 06/07/1961

----

Patient 214, Cal L. Humphreys, viciously beat one of the attendees this afternoon as the staff attempted to restrain Cal in order to administer a new type of therapy. Cal is a unique challenge as a patient; his large size and muscular frame makes it difficult to control his violent outbursts. In addition, his psychotic episodes seem to revolve around resisting all treatment, be it medicinal or psychiatric counseling.

Cal suffers from a somewhat common delusion born of a narcissistic personality disorder. He believes that he is a superhuman, with incredible powers. To be more precise, he believes that he is an extra-terrestrial who coincidentally looks exactly like a human, but is given powers by the sun. During our sessions, I have attempted to force the patient to outline exactly what powers he has, hoping that this would cause him to confront the rules of the delusion.  Instead, he seems to simply add new abilities to ones that he believes he already has, and is able to incorporate that new power into his fantasy world. Heat vision, super-strength, super speed, flying... whatever he feels will accentuate his story at the time is incorporated into his library of abilities. He has also created a separate identity, often when he is experiencing a more lucid phase. At these times, he refers to himself as "Clark Kent," and thinks he is a journalist at a newspaper.

There is also an elaborate set of villains in his world that seem to be based on his perceptions of the staff here at the hospital. The attendant he attacked today, Mark Anderson, is known as "Darkside" to the patient. As Cal attacked Mr. Anderson, he was ranting about a trap that "Darkside" had set for him, presumably describing the restraints on the table. Cal called out to other patients nearby, for whom he has also invented various "hero" personas; he refers to them as the "Justice League." Luckily, the other patients (some of whom have similar personality disorders) were already restrained. The only staff member that seems to be able to work with Cal has been Nurse Lane, but I fear that it fosters an improper connection that will only result in a more severe breakdown when he learns that they do not really have a romantic relationship.

I am at a loss for how to treat this patient. Haloperidol showed promising results, but Cal is incredibly resistant to even the smallest dose. He treats it like some poison, and says that it takes all of his powers away. This shows that he recognizes the effects of the drug, which is promising. However, simply administering the shot has become a process that can take hours; he struggles constantly and fights back, even when sedated. At this point, I am concerned that he will break the needle while it is in his skin, which could potentially cause severe internal damage. As a result, we only administer the haloperidol during counseling sessions. I will continue to study the patient and attempt to develop a new course of therapy, but I am running out of options and losing hope.
