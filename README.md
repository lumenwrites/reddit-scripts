I have been experimenting with reddit API, and have decided to compile the list of the most upvoted [/r/WritingPrompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/) [authors](http://orangemind.io/top-authors) and their [best stories](http://orangemind.io/top-stories-all). Due to the limitations of the API the data can not be 100% exact, but it's pretty close.

"Karma" is calculated based on the number of upvotes to top-level comments, other comments and submitted prompts don't count.
