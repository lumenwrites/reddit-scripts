#### [WP] "Adulthood is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane."

Score: 5553

"I'm sorry to bring you here like this."

"Not at all, my dear boy. Not at all."

"But, you see, I have to know… I have to know, and you're the only one –"

"I get it," the old man interrupted me. He puffed his cheeks weakly, like it took him great effort just to breathe, 
and then he leaned back against the armchair and his eyes turned to the crackling of the fireplace. "Ask away."

"Well… it's pretty simple, actually." I leaned forward. "What's it like?"

His eyes turned to me, and he almost smiled. *"What's it like?"*

"Yeah. Life. Growing up. Being old." I paused. "Well, not that I'm calling you old, I just –"

"It's okay, dear boy," he laughed. "I am old. That's why you brought me here."

I said nothing. He arranged himself on the armchair like he had all the time in the world. Then his eyes went up to 
me again. "It's… hard."

I waited. I knew he wasn't done.

"It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, actually" he continued. "Harder than building all this fancy equipment you've built. Harder than studying all you've studied. Harder than winning all these scientific awards you've won so far." He chuckled. "Nothing prepares you for it."

"What makes it hard?" I asked. "Is it the responsibilities? The body decaying? What makes growing up so hard?"

"No. It's not the responsibilities. Growing up is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane." He lowered his head as if to put his thoughts together, then continued. "It's the things you don't expect that catch you by surprise. Sure, it's scary to have a kid, and to get married, and to ask your boss for a promotion, and all these grown-up stuff we have to *pretend* we know how to do."

"Pretend?"

He seemed surprised. "Yes, pretend. No one really grows up, of course. We put on a face to the world, but at home, three in the morning, all alone watching TV, you're still sixteen. All of us are." He shook his head. "There's nothing more heartbreaking than being a real person and sitting down in front of another real person, and then both of you have to act like fake people. You sit across from someone two years older than you in a job interview and you both say 'Hello, sir' and 'Yes, I also think the Dow Jones has been fluctuating dangerously this last few days' and 'Oh, absolutely, the 405 is a nightmare this time of day'. And all along you *know* you both laugh at poop jokes and fart sounds and you have all these hobbies and interests and you curse and say fuck and shit and asshole. You're real people. But you act like robots. You have to put on the face, and they have to put on a face, and you have to pretend that nothing in life is ever fun, everything is productivity and seriousness."

"Is that what makes it hard?" I asked. "That everyone's just… faking their way through adulthood?"

"No. No, that's expected. It sucks, but we all know what we're getting into." He sighed. "No, what catches you by 
surprise are the little things about growing up. It's being stuck in traffic and remembering a day. Any day. A locker 
room conversation in high school. A teacher. A friend of a friend. Something that happened long enough ago that 
it could order its own drink. It sneaks up on you, and you look at yourself in the rear view and you think, my 
God… where did it go? When did I become so old?

"I remember college like it was yesterday. I remember my girlfriends and my friends and they used to drink and 
talk about sex and hanging out and now they all eat oatmeal and go to funerals. And I do that to, and I *like* all of that. Well, not going to funerals, but oatmeal. Soap operas. Going to bed at nine. I like it."

"So what's the problem?"

"The problem is I'm still the sixteen year old. I'm still the college kid. My needs and wants have changed, and my 
body has changed, and my mind has changed, in a way, but *I* didn't change. I'm still putting on a face. So when 
these thoughts sneak up on me – when a flash of a college party or a roadtrip or the feeling of falling asleep in the 
back of my Dad's car wells up on me… it breaks me. It breaks me because I don't think of it fondly. I don't look at 
that young kid with affection and nostalgia, I look at him with envy. Envy, because he's got all of that ahead of him 
still, and he doesn't even know how lucky he is. He's me, we're the same – but he's got the good looks and the 
health and all the years ahead of him, and I'm wasting away in an old apartment. And I hate that kid so much. Every time he sneaks up on me I hate him more."

I looked down, then up. "What about family? Kids?"

"They are great. They are amazing. But they go away. They're not *you*. In the end, you raise your sons and 
daughters for the world, not for yourself. They have to fall asleep in the back of *my* car, and go to *their* college parties and all that… they don't exist for my benefit. No one exists for my benefit but myself. And I'm much too old to do anything about it."

I swallowed dry and averted my eyes to the fireplace. The old man leaned forward. "We always get the feeling that 
the good old days are either behind us or ahead of us. They're never our own days. We were always born just a 
bit too late to go to Woodstock or to see Nirvana live or to see the Berlin Wall fall or to party Great Gatsby style in the 20's. And then we get old and we realize we were born too soon to see the wonders of technology and the world reshaping and blooming into something new and exciting. But the truth is, our Woodstocks were happening all around us as we grew. Our new and exciting world was some old guy's boring present, and our past will be some spoiled, arrogant kid's 'Good old days'. We were just too stupid to realize it when it mattered. So we let it slide away. And then we ended up like me – sad and resentful of our younger selves for all they can still do and we can't."

Finally, I got up. I went to the old man and I knelt in front of him. "I'm sorry I brought you over."

"It's okay," he said. "I knew you would. After all, I did it, sixty years ago."

I looked at my own eyes. Despite the wrinkles around them, they still looked pretty much the same. The old man 
shook his head and sniffed a tear away. "Now let's go back to your lab so you can send me back to my own time, 
so I can hate you in peace."

I hugged my own eighty year old version and leaned away and nodded. "I'll enjoy it," I said. "And I'll know I'm living in the good old days, I promise."

He got up with difficulty. "No, you won't," he said. "The good old days are only ever good when they're gone. That's what makes them good. When you're living through them, they're just... days."

He slow-stepped ahead of me towards the lab. Then he spoke without turning his head: "And days go by really fast, man. They go by really fast."

#### [WP] You have the ability to reverse time by 6 hours whenever you're about to die. You're currently on a 10 hour flight on a plane that's about to crash.

Score: 3545

I was back in my seat, around six hours before the accident, watching the in-flight entertainment, and wondering how something like a plane crash could become so boring so quickly.

The plane loses an engine, all the warning lights start to go off, the plane tilts down, a smell of smoke, and I'm back here. Every time.

This is at least the ninth time I've looped, and after going through most of the good in-flight movies, I was down to the slim pickings when I had an idea.

I go back whenever I'm about to die...right?

The knife from the airline food packet would have to do. Most of the passengers were asleep at this point, so nobody noticed as I plunged the plastic blade into my chest.

---

Six hours ago. In the terminal. Waiting. 

It worked. **It worked**.

My head was spinning with possibilities, and I still had the knife. There was only one option.

Stab.

Six hour ago. In bed, asleep before the Five AM flight.

Stab.

–-

Six hours ago. Getting ready for bed, brushing teeth.

Stab.

---

Six hours ago. I was watching TV.

Stab.

Six hours ago.

Stab. 

Six hours ago.

Stab. Stab. Stab Stab Stab Stab...

---

It's at least 2010.

I think I've de-aged, but my memories are intact. I've still got the knife. I don't know what to do.

I can predict the future. A real life psychic. I can mold my life to be the best one possible. Killing people just to see what happens, then going back and doing it again. Stock markets, speculation, investments, unexplored possibilities revisited, old loves rekindled-

But that was for later. For now, I had only one question. How far back could I go?

I readied the plastic knife, and started all over again.

Stab. Stab. Stab.

#### [WP] A man orders a "cheese pizza with no crust" from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine.

Score: 3206

At the sound of the doorbell, I heaved myself from my seat. 

I moved over to the door, ready to go on an angry rant about the time. Who the hell thought two in the morning was a good time to turn up at your house? They could’ve woken me up! They didn’t, but they could’ve, and it’s the thought that counts.

I opened the door and my words died on my lips. A man in a pizza deliveryman’s costume stood there, smoking a cigarette and flanked by two burly men in tracksuits. Behind them, a bright red SUV was parked, its lights off but engine still gently running.

“Uh…hi?”

The pizza man dropped his cigarette. “Show us the money first.”

I glanced around. “Am…am I being robbed?”

The man snorted. “Robbed? Hell no. We’ve got the best prices around.”

I looked at the symbol on the man’s hat and came to a sudden realisation. “You’re from Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour!”

“Hell yeah, I am. Now where’s the money?”

“I called you guys six hours ago.” Prank-called them, to be specific, asking for a ridiculous order. Come to think of it, I hadn’t even given them my address.

The pizza man snorted. “What, you thought we were gonna come in broad daylight? And people don’t normally ask for such massive amounts.”

“I only asked for a cheese pizza with no crust.”

“Man, what do you mean ‘only’? It would take years to get through a cheese pizza without the crust. What do you normally buy?”

I rolled my eyes. “A Hawaiian pizza with no cheese or pineapple.”

The pizza man’s eyes widened. “Holy shit, dude. Are you some kind of millionaire?” He turned back to one of the men. “This guy’s a real buyer; go get the product.”

The man nodded and headed back to the SUV. He rooted around in it for a minute before turning the lights on, revealing a myriad of logos for Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour that I somehow hadn’t seen before.

He returned soon, clutching a briefcase, which he handed to the pizza man, who laid it on the floor and clicked it open, revealing a pristine pizza box. Slowly and carefully, he stood, and then handed it to me.

“It’s all in there, dude.”

What the hell were these guys on about? I opened the box.

 “Guys, I didn’t order a box of flour.”

#### [WP] Everyone is born with a disability and an ability. A test is done at birth to determine these, if they aren't already apparent. You, well, you were born with crippled legs and have the power of super speed.

Score: 2830

See, what most people don't realise about super speed is that it doesn't just affect your legs. Your entire body moves fast. People never tend to get that because you see guys like Ravel Alton sprinting at three hundred kilometres an hour down the speedway. I mean, it's more impressive *visually* than what I can do... but I like to think that my abilities are still pretty good.

"Checkmate," I smile, knocking over the white king with my own rook. Valentin, my opponent, stares at me in shock. By the look on his face, my guess is that his ability was mind-reading. It's a good way to become a chess champion, I'll give him that. 

But he can't keep up with me.

See, from the femtosecond his finger touched the first piece, I started running through the possible moves in my head. All of them. 

Do you know how many possible positions there are after each player moves three times? More than 9 million. That goes up to 288 billion after four moves each. But when you can't move without a wheelchair, and when you have a brain that can scan and memorise information faster than anything else on the planet... and when you also have a lot of time on your hands... you can memorise everything. Every perfect game. 

Not to mention, of course... Valentin might be able to read minds. But he can't process information as fast as I can. Which leaves him unable to comprehend the million, million, million thoughts I have every nanosecond.

I can't run. But that doesn't mean I'm not *fast*.

#### [WP] A group of Viking encounters a Siren at sea, her voice is luring the men to their doom - except one. Now it's up to a closeted gay Viking to save the day.

Score: 2439

Bjarke heard a melodious voice sail over the sides of the longship, weaving promises in the minds of those around him.

For the love of Odin, he thought, rolling his eyes. It's a damn Siren.

He looked at his men, who were entranced by the hypnotizing voice and moving close to the railing. If he didn't act soon, he'd lose his whole daft crew in seconds to the cunning beast. Bjarke spent the next several minutes strongarming his magicked crew into the belly of the longship before bolting the door shut from the outside. Lucky for him, his mother had been a witch and he was able to knock them out with a simple spell. That would prevent any of them from hacking a hole in the side of his ship. He worked hard to build it and Bjarke wasn't about to let some song-drunk idiot sink it.

The lilting voice grew stronger as the Siren tried to beckon the men. Bjarke stepped up to the railing.

"For Thor's sake, shut the hell up, you hussy!" he shouted over the gray water.

He saw head pop out of the water, rage written on her beautiful features. In an instant, the silver-haired Siren was at the side of the longship and scowling up at him.

"Hussy!" she shrieked. "Listen here you sansorðinn! I may be a lot of things but a hussy is not one of them. I will drag you down to a watery death."

Bjarke give her an amused smile. It would be a joy to tease this creature.

He brought his meticulously cared for nails to his face for inspection before saying, "What could you possibly need with all the men on my ship if not to be a hussy."

The woman sputtered in shock before summoning a wave to push herself onto the boat's deck. Bjarke yelped in surprise as he was soaked from head to toe. Great. This was one of his nicest shirts and now it was covered in seaweed and salt water. Blinking the stinging water from his eyes, the Viking saw the Siren stand up, her scaled tail disappearing now that she was no longer in the water. She stood before him naked, her long silvery strands of hair covering her breasts.

"You listen to me," she hissed, poking him in the chest with sharp fingernail. "I am Iona, a magnificent creature of the sea descended from Ægir himself. I will not be reduced to the image of a wanton woman by the likes of you."

Bjarke merely stared at Iona, unperturbed.

"Why are you not affected by my singing," the Siren asked, suddenly curious. "You are a male of a hale and hearty stock. You should have been one of the first to respond to my beckoning."

Bjarke's eye twitched. Yes, she would think that, wouldn't she. This was a secret he had kept close always. A secret that, if revealed, would come with a price. He was not ready to lose all he had worked hard for.

"Yeah, well. Not all of us are tricked by your charms."

Iona pursed her lips and circled him like a vulture.

"Hmmm," she said, tapping a finger to her lips. She glanced down towards his groin. "Are you lacking the needed equipment?"

Bjarke glared at her.

"I have perfectly working 'equipment' thank you very much."

Iona's perfectly shaped brows raised up high in realization.

"You're fuðflogi," she said, breathlessly. "That makes so much sense."

The Viking shushed the Siren harshly.

"Yes," he said in a hushed voice, despite the fact they were the only two conscious on the longship. "But no one knows."

"It is not an evil thing to desire the love of another man," Iona said to the burly, bearded man.

"Not everyone sees it that way," he said gruffly, running his hand over his braided blonde hair. "I will have to marry soon or else they will know."

"I will make you a deal," Iona said, taking sudden pity on the man. "I will help make you the most feared viking in the world if you take me away from this Odin-forsaken spit of land I've been stuck on. "

Bjarke looked at the silver-haired maiden curiously.

"You are a Siren," he said. "Can you not travel the waters freely?"

"Not as freely as you think," she said, sadly. "If I am captured in my human form, I am bound to them and the magic chaining me to this barren place will be split. I will instead by chained to you until you die."

"I would not wish that on anyone," he said.

"It is what I wish. It seems it would not be so bad to be chained to you until your death," Iona said thoughtfully. "I will appear as your wife and help you claim the world. Then we will both be free. I am able to mask my voice as to not charm your village. All you need to do is bind me to you through blood."

Bjarke looked at her, considering her offer. From his belt he drew a knife, slicing a shallow cut down is arm. He held it out to Iona, who mimicked his actions.

"Deal."

#### [WP] You're a 12 year-old in a world domintated by magic. A small, feeble man appears on your doorstep claiming: "You're a scientist, Henry"

Score: 2355

Henry and Roy shuffled into the cafeteria along with the other forty first year students who would be starting at the East Brighton Preparatory Academy. The other students, already seated at the tables, barely looked up from their meals. It didn't look much like the Great Hall of Hogwarts that he had seen in Mum and Dad'said photos. Instead of a thousand floating candles and a stormy sky, Henry just saw dirty ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights. And there were no long wooden tables with silver platters of food, but instead scuffed red plastic tags and dented aluminum trays heaped with something that almost looked like macaroni and cheese.

"This must be the Sorting!" Henry whispered eagerly to Roy. "My father told me all about it!" He searched the room for any noticeable banners to see what the different houses were, but he couldn't see any. No matter; the muggle's version of the Sorting Hat would surely explain it. 

"Sorting?" Roy grunted. "Sorting *what*?" He was muggle born, after all, so of course he wouldn't know how it was done at Hogwarts.

*Do the muggles not do sorting?* Henry wondered. That didn't make sense. Haggard had even brought him to a Muggle library so that he could learn a bit more about his school before the first day; they'd used a machine that Haggard had called an "internet." There, he saw pictures of mascots and all the bright colors, just like the Gryffindor lion. And while they were at the Muggle's version of Diagon Alley (Called "Shopping Mall,") Haggard had explained that all the boys would be split up to live in different areas of the school. There had to be a sorting, right?

"You know," Henry tried to explain, "Like, where they split us all up and decide what house we're going to live in."

"Ohhhh." Roy nodded understandingly. "Yeah, 'at's what *this* is for." The young girl in front of Roy turned right then and passed a stack of papers to him. They weren't the yellowish parchament that Henry was used to; just plain white squares covered in black writing. Roy took one for himself and then passed the stack to Henry. 

Henry studied the options, each with a little blank check box next to it:

> Windsor Building, Dorm A

> Windsor Building, Dorm B

> Churchill Building, Dorm A

> Churchill Building, Dorm B

"Errr...." Henry wasn't sure if this was right. Where was the Hat to make the decision? "You just pick one?"

"Yeah," Roy answered, seeming a bit confused. "Wotchu think, Henry? Want to room together?

"Sure!" He didn't have to stop and think about it. Regardless of what House they chose together, it would be good to be with a friend.

"Well, my brother Doug was in Churchill B 'is first year," Roy explained. A roguish grin spread across his face. "'e said that it's got a pretty good view into the girls dormitory across the quad! I say we grab that one!" The girl in front of Roy turned around and shot daggers at him along with a look of disgust. She was likely trying to figure out which dorm was *not* across from Churchill B.

Henry looked back down at the paper. "Well... what attributes does House Churchill fit best? Because I think that I'm fairly studious and intelligent, but my *father*'s house was known for being brave and those things tend to run in the family." He frowned; this really would be easier if there was just a hat to the decision.

Roy's face screwed up in confusion. "Henry, you're a weird bloke. What the hell are you talking about?"

"You know..." This was so frustrating! Henry'd never had to deal with Muggles before. "Isn't our house supposed to match our personality?"

Roy laughed. "It's just a place to live, Henry. It'll be a bunk bed and a desk with a little lamp on it. Probably broken, if what my brothers all told me is true. That's about it."

"Oh." Henry looked down at his paper. "I guess Churchill B will be fine then." He looked around for someone passing out feathers to write with, but there were none. Just some little orange sticks topped with what looked like bubblegum. Roy took one and pressed it against his paper, and it made a mark in the box, so Henry copied him. Just like that, it was done. That was the muggle version of sorting. 

Roy and Henry turned in their forms and were shepherded into a different line. They were given trays and walked past a counter with a glass sneeze shield. A frumpy old woman ladled heaps of orange goo onto their trays from a big metal bin that was indeed labeled "macaroni and cheese." Henry couldn't see a single noodle in there. Then they found their way to tables and sat in no particular order; Henry didn't even know who the other members of Churchill B were yet.

"So this is the feast?" Henry asked, poking at his goo. Roy had already devoured half of his portion. 

"Yep!" Roy said. "But don't get used to it. My brothers said the food gets worse after the first night. They're trying to make a good impression and whatnot." He followed that sentence by shoveling another forkful into his mouth. 

Henry looked down at his orange blob. He decided he didn't like being a scientist very much.

#### [WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.

Score: 2311

Before me stretched an impossibly long hallway. Big, imposing, steel bulkhead doors lined the concrete walls. Sickly lights that were evenly spaced along the hallway provided illumination. Everything was in a state of decay. The lights flickered on and off. The steel doors were rusted and some of the tiles on the floor were missing. Bloodcurdling screams could be heard all around you along with twisted laughter and grotesque fapping. It was hard to think in all of this noise.

Satan lead me down the hallway. He had a smug grin plastered on his face and it hadn't changed once since I first met him. The demon was completely red. His entire body was completely red. He was also naked. I didn't dare to ask why.

There were little circular windows on the bulkhead doors. In one room I saw an emaciated old man surrounded by food. Cakes, freshly cooked meat, ripe fruit and glistening wine. It all looked like something right out of a commercial. The man was trying to shove as much food in his face as possible, only to gag and hurl it back out.

In another room there was a woman covered in bloody red eyes. She tore at them with her fingers, screaming as she did so. In yet another, a teenage girl was being surrounded by six little toddlers. Each of them were eyeless, skinless little things that poked at her with hot iron pokers. There seemed to be thousands of these little rooms.

Satan put one burning red hand on my shoulder and guided me onwards. He grinned smuggily. His smug levels seemed to have increased tenfold. I tried to ignore what was poking me in the thigh. Satan led me to a door that looked like all the rest.

"Well, sport! This one's yours. I know it might be a bit hot in the summer, but atleast you don't have to worry about heating bills!", Satan grinned smugly. He pointed finger pistols at me. I stared at Satan. A man behind me screamed as he was being flayed alive. 

Satan shoved me into my personal cell. "Enjoy enternal damnation, Mrs. Pierce!", he said as he disappeared with a poof. The bulkhead closed on it's own and I was faced with my worst nightmares.

Snakes. Thousands of them. They were a piled up on eachother. When I entered the room, they all hissed to greet me. One particularly large cobra was as thick as a tree and as long as seven men. The cobra rose to face level and hissed at me. I slowly raised my fist.

And booped it. On the nose. So many sneks and an enternity to boop them all. My face lit up with a smile. I hugged the cobra, cradling it in my arms. I never noticed how Satan called me Mrs. Pierce. Too many sneks. 

. . . M E A N W H I L E . . .

In front of Mrs. Rachel Pierce was a large football field. The bulkhead door spun shut behind her. The sky was blue, the birds were chirping. Handsome, sweaty football players tackled eachother on the field. When they noticed her, they passed the football to her. She jumped and caught it with both hands, clutching it to her chest. 

"Oi! You weak-legged cunt! Come join us for a game!", the incredibly buff football player yelled at Mrs. Pierce.

And yes, Mrs. Pierce's legs were particularly weak in this moment. This was her fetish. This was like, all of her fetishes.

She let out a small "Yesss!", before joining them with a smile on her face.

#### [WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.

Score: 2047

*Chris this, Chris that. Chris, you're so cool. Chris, let me help you with that. I'm sick of this shit.*

Chris Mayer, the freshmen who just joined high school, was loved by everyone immediately. The girls, the guys, the jocks, the losers- everyone wanted to be his friend. Me? It was my senior year. 

One day, I was eating lunch in a bathroom stall and just grew sick of it all. Sick of the unfair bullshit, the way people were nice to him but hated me. It was just because of his cancer, I knew it damn well. Worst of all was the way he smiled at me, or waved and said hi to me like nothing was wrong. It was him I hated most. 

June 19th: the day I graduated from high school. My uncle was there, but no other family, and certainly no friends. Yet there that little bastard was, IV rack in hand, cheering and clapping for the senior class. Someone dedicated a speech to him. Everyone gathered around him after the ceremony. My uncle left halfway through, before I even got on stage. 

I left before the midnight party began, just after sunset. Since my uncle had abandoned me, I was forced to take a bus stop that was almost a mile away. I took a shortcut through a side alleyway to the building our graduation had been held in, where I found Chris bent over and retching violently.

"Oh, dear," he said weakly, forcing a small laugh. "I came here so no one would see me like this. It's pretty bad these days."

No words formed in my mind; there was only an animalistic rage swirling, mudding my thoughts. I pummeled the living shit out of that frail, little boy. Every punch was vindication, every tooth knocked loose a symbol for my shattered dignity. Soon I was just taking out all my angers on him; my family, my loneliness, my uselessness. He was an emotional punching bag I'd made literal.

By the time I stopped, it was too late. Fuck, there was so much blood on me and the road, and his twisted little body. And yet, through labored breaths, through broken bones and missing teeth, he tried to smile. He tried to say something to me as well, but the blood pooling in his throat left the words inaudible before he started choking. 

I ran. I didn't call for help, I just ran. No one caught me, somehow, and he died that night in a hospital bed. Not from the cancer eating away at him, but from my fists. I cried the whole night, and couldn't sleep for three days because every time I closed my eyes, I saw his mangled little face trying to smile. That whole time, it was *me* I hated, not him. 

That night, I went home and punched myself in the face as hard as I could. I wanted to give myself a taste of what I'd given the poor boy in his last few hours, to feel what he felt, but no matter how many times I hit my face... I felt nothing. I checked a mirror to see if I'd just broken myself, but I looked sharper than ever.

Ever since then, I've haven't been able to hurt someone with a punch. In fact...I heal them, like my hands are imbued with the life I stole from him. Hands I'm afraid of, because I know he's haunting me.

I don't know how...

...but I wish they'd worked that way on the day I graduated.

Dan always had the coolest parents.  He could do whatever he wanted and they never seemed to care.  Most of the time they weren't around.  When they were they just told us to have those microwave meals and "take care of ourselves" like we were adults too.  My mom never let me have those microwave meals, she said they were bad for you, and she was always nagging me to do my homework.  Not like Dan's parents, we could do whatever we wanted there.

I remember when we would make pretend armies and wage war for control of the Carpet Kingdom.  The cans were our infantry, the small bottles were the cavalry and the bigger bottles were the artillery.  We would have huge armies and fight over the whole house, from one end of the carpet to the other.

Today his parents had let him set up a swing in their house.  He had attached one end of the rope to a light fixture and the other end kept his feet dangling off the ground.  I gave him a push and he swung back and forth.  "When do I get to go?" I asked.  He didn't say anything, but he never said much.  I couldn't wait for my turn.

"This seems kind of weird," Kendra was sitting in a reclining leather chair. Behind her were several people in long judge costumes complete with powdered wigs. "I don't know anything about the worth of someone's life or where they should go."

"Never had a religion or a code of ethics?" one of the judges raised an eyebrow. Kendra couldn't really tell them apart, but there was only one that spoke. 

"Not that I remember," Kendra began to play with the hem of her dress. "But a lot of it is blank. I don't...I don't *think* I did."

"That's ok," the judge waved his hand. "Sometimes we just like to get outside opinions."

Kendra thought there was something seemingly off about this, but couldn't put her finger quite on what. She swallowed as the chair turned back around and she looked up at the screen. 

It was like watching life through someone's eyes. There were little snippets of action - the world opening up like a flower in bloom and seeing two faces looking down at her. A man in a mask and a woman who held her close. 

There was the sound of crying and babbling. A muffled argument late at night while a mobile spun lazily above her head. The sound of a woman singing and the surprising feel of a hand in hers. 

Kendra jumped, pulling her hand from the armrest into her lap. Behind her there came laughter. "Don't be alarmed," the voice of the judge. "This will feel quite real at times."

Slowly the world began to shift from horizontal to vertical. Trees that had seemed massive began to shrink. There was a man's face that peered down at her with disappointment. A sharp pain across her face and around her upper arm. A whisper that wound its way into her ear. *Don't you ever tell a soul.*

A young child that sneered at her and taunted her with cries of *chicken legs* and *freak*. The running of a sink and hearing sniffling sounds that reached her own ears. 

Smiling faces. Angry faces. Faces filled with disgust. The feel of her own greasy hair as she dragged a trash bag full of things to school. The pity in teachers' faces. *Poor girl. Parents just can't keep it together.*

A small dark space. A sniffling cry. A begging to be let out that poured from her own mouth. The sound of a key and the smell of mothballs. The twisting of a doorknob and a tray of food shoved inside. 

"Please," her voice begged. "Please!"

A man who held her hand and told her it would be alright. The embarrassment of finding red between her legs in the middle of a science class. The chilly inside of a car on a winter's morning as she pulled a sweater tight around herself for warmth. 

Sitting on the side of the road with an empty cup. Looking at the faces of those disgusted with her. Walking into a store and shoving her pockets full of things. Her own hand brandishing a knife at a woman on the street. 

A bridge at night. A whooshing wind. A splash of ice. 

The picture faded. Kendra sat still and raised her hand to her face to find it wet. The chair spun again until she again faced the men in black. 

"So what do you think?"

Kendra started. "What do I think? I don't know. I think it's horrible. But I don't know if it's good or bad. Just sad. And the ending..."

"You feel sympathy for her?"

"Of course. Only pain and suffering could drive her to an end like that."

"What about her sins?" The man gave a wry smile. "What about the theft? The sloth? The knife?"

"I feel nothing but sympathy and sadness for her," Kendra said. 

"Do you think you could forgive her?"

"Forgive her? What has she done to me?"

"Could you forgive your mother for leading such a life? Your best friend? Your child? For taking the easy way out?"

"She suffered so." Kendra paused. "Of course. I just wish there was another option. To try again. I wish I could hold her hand and tell her it wasn't her fault. I wish I could give her happiness."

"What about yourself?"

Slowly the memories bloomed in Kendra's mind. She sat stunned as they flooded back. Her eyes began to sting and her throat began to tighten. "That was...that was..."

"Can you show yourself the same kindness and forgiveness you would show to someone else? Can you allow yourself to see the pain and desperation that *you* felt without the judgement or the self hatred?"

Kendra stared at them and said nothing. It felt as though someone had reached into her chest to squeeze her heart. 

The judge smiled. "Ah yes. It's much easier to see our pain when we see it through someone else's eyes. Why don't you try again? See if you can show yourself more kindness."

The judge reached out to push a button. Then, as though she had been pulled into a vacuum, the world went black.

#### [WP] The entire Star Wars series, all 7 movies, are released as one book, written by Dr. Seuss.

Score: 1907

A long time ago, and so far far away,

There was a rebellion in space, so they say!

That old Evil Empire was up to no good

They kidnapped a princess, you knew that they would!

And then with the might only money can buy,

They set out to make a Death Star, in the sky!

That dastardly Emperor!

That Scoundrel! That Fiend!

Could nobody stop him? Would no one intervene? 


But the princess was crafty - and with luck she escaped! 

SHE wasn't held back by a bit of a scrape!

Though she didn't get far, she did get far enough

And she sent out a droid with a message - times were rough!

Though she knew that her plan had no chance of success,

It was all she could do - A New Hope, for the rest


And as luck would have it, her plans met with a teen

They flew all the way down to the planet, Tatooine! 

When Luke picked them up, he had no way to tell

That this was the start of his personal hell


He went to a master - a man named Old Ben

And in fear for his family, he went home again!

But when he arrived, he found they all died

So with nothing to hold him, to the stars he did fly!


Soon they met with a smuggler, a man named Solo

He said he could take them where they had to go!

But while flying along on their journey to space

Old Obi Wan feels something - pain across his face!

"I sense a disturbance" He said with no doubt

"As if hundreds of people had suddenly cried out

And then they were silent - I do not like this" 

Luke looked on in horror, he knew something's amiss

"Wait, that's no moon! It's a space station!" he said with a hiss!


Before they knew it, and before they could react

They were suddenly captured - they were under attack!

Though they managed to hide, in the smuggler's den

They had no way to escape - they were trapped in a pen!


"I'll disable the beam, you distract the guards

I have unfinished business aboard this Death Star"

Old Ben was Kenobi, a Jedi Knight supreme

And he could feel Vader on board, like a dream



They fought and they ran, sneaking between the guards

It seemed that victory was here - luck in their cards!

And with the princess they managed to escape

"But wait, that was too easy - it had to be fake!" 

"Too easy - you're joking, that was incredibly hard!

And Old Ben got killed! Our victory's marred!

Despite her objections, they went on their way

Down to the rebel base, to enter the fray!

But Leia was right - it had been a trap!

The were tracked to the base! The rebellion was scrap!

"If we don't hurry, soon they'll kill us all! 

But look at these plans - we can blow up that ball!

We'll need pilots with skill, we'll need pilots with grace

To fire proton torpedoes, right here, at this place!

This mission is hard - without doubt, some will die

But it is our only hope - so fly pilots, fly!"


And so Luke joined their ranks, and he jumped in a ship

To fly down a trench - pray a wing doesn't clip!

And though many were killed - in fact, most happened to die

Luke made it to the end - and his torpedoes did fly!

He shot without computer, Someone said "Use the Force!"

And with that mysterious power, he struck at the source!

With luck and with skill, sacrifice and Hope,

The Death Star exploded - Luke's a hero! Don't mope!

From farm boy to Jedi, an unknown to the best

Luke's journey wasn't over - it's just the start of his quest!

FADE IN:

INT. A DARK ROOM

*A young man sits on a large blob of slowly undulating plastic. This is DAVE. Each time that he shifts his weight, the whitish mass beneath him adjusts itself slightly, forcing him to move in a constant search for comfort.*

**T'AAR:** (*O.S.*) I'm so sorry about the wait, ma'am!

*A diminutive alien walks into view. This is T'AAR, a bureaucrat, who is carrying what appears to be a rectangle of softly glowing light.*

**DAVE:** It's "sir," actually.    
**T'AAR:** Oh, I'd much prefer to stick to the formalities, ma'am.    
**DAVE:** "Sir" is a formality.

*T'aar glances at the glowing rectangle.*

**T'AAR:** Really? What does it mean?    
**DAVE:** Uh, well... it's the masculine form of "ma'am."    
**T'ARR:** You distinguish by gender in your honorifics?    
**DAVE:** I guess?    
**T'AAR:** Interesting. Well, ma'am... uh, sir... I understand that you've registered a formal complaint with the Galactic Transportation Authority.

*Dave suddenly looks desperate.*

**DAVE:** No! No, it's like I keep telling everyone: This is all a big misunderstanding!    
**T'AAR:** I'm sure it is, ma... sir. We'll see about getting it sorted right out. What was the nature of your complaint?    
**DAVE:** I didn't make a complaint!

*Once again, T'aar glances at the glowing rectangle.*

**T'AAR:** References to intercourse are considered expletives in your culture, yes?    
**DAVE:** In some situations, yes, but...    
**T'AAR:** (*Interrupting*) Oh, wait! This is back to that whole "gendered honorifics" thing, isn't it?    
**DAVE:** ... What?    
**T'AAR:** Sorry, just an observation. To the point, though: You *did* shout "Screw GTA!" over an all-systems broadcast, did you not?

*Dave's desperation gives way to nervousness.*

**T'AAR:** (*CONT'D*) Once translated from your tongue, "GTA" becomes an initialism for...    
**DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) I didn't know *aliens* would hear it! I was just mad about a video game!    
**T'AAR:** "Video game?"    
**DAVE:** It's... it's entertainment. We use computers to simulate the world, and then we... you know, we play games.    
**T'AAR:** Oh, yes, we do similar things when we're designing ships.    
**DAVE:** Well, there's a little more to it than that. Like, in GTA, you drive around stealing things and shooting people.

*T'aar's enormous black eyes widen further.*

**T'AAR:** Sorry... you *shoot* people? With weapons?    
**DAVE:** It's not real!    
**T'AAR:** I should hope not. This is entertainment to you?    
**DAVE:** Yeah. It seems kind of weird, right? What with all the war going on.    
**T'AAR:** What war? Your species isn't space-faring.    
**DAVE:** Oh. Well, it's... we fight each other.

*A moment of silence passes.*

**T'AAR:** Is this a joke?    
**DAVE:** What? No!    
**T'AAR:** You honestly fight amongst yourselves? Why?    
**DAVE:** There are lots of reasons. Resources, religion...    
**T'AAR:** (*Interrupting*) What's that?    
**DAVE:** A can of worms that I'm not going to get into right now.    
**T'AAR:** ... Your species fights over worms.    
**DAVE:** No! We mostly fight over land!    
**T'AAR:** What land?    
**DAVE:** *Any* land!    
**T'AAR:** Ma'am, you're not making any sense.    
**DAVE:** "Sir."    
**T'AAR:** Yes?    
**DAVE:** ... No, no, *I'm* a "sir."    
**T'AAR:** Oh, yes, you mentioned as much. Now, please elaborate.    
**DAVE:** Look, we have these different countries, okay? Some of them don't like each other.    
**T'AAR:** So they go to war.    
**DAVE:** Yes.    
**T'AAR:** In video games.    
**DAVE:** No, for real.    
**T'AAR:** You *physically kill each other* because people on one piece of land don't like people on another piece of land?    
**DAVE:** Ye... yes?    
**T'AAR:** And this has something to do with worms?    
**DAVE:** N... well... look, it's complicated.

*T'aar's voice adopts a patronizing tone.*

**T'AAR:** Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it's very complicated. Just wait here for a couple more minutes, okay? I'll be back shortly.    
**DAVE:** No, wait, what about...

*Before Dave can finish his sentence, T'aar disappears into the darkness.*

**T'AAR:** (*O.S.*) Make yourself comfortable!

*Dave shifts around on the blob of undulating plastic. Eventually, he gets up and sits on the floor.*

**DAVE:** (*To himself*) Well, it beats visiting the DMV...

FADE OUT.

#### [WP] You applied for a job at google, everything goes well and only one interview remains: They'd just like an explanation for your search history.

Score: 1833

"Well, Mr. Powell," the interviewer adjusted his glasses, "Your references all seem to be in order, and everyone spoke very highly of you."

The last knot in my stomach unraveled. *Thank god*. I mean, I knew that I would have nothing to worry about. Otherwise, why would I have listed those people as references? But still: it was nice to finally hear. I'd been through days of testing and seen the applicant pool whittled down from two hundred to just three of us left, applying for two spots. 

"Just one last thing." He removed a large (like, book-sized) manila folder from his desk and slammed it down in front of me, making the whole desk shake. "Let's discuss your search history." The sentence that *every* young man fears, though I'd been expecting it to come from my girlfriend, not a potential employer. 

"I..." He slid the folder over to me and then tapped his fingers together like Mr. Burns. I extended one finger and flipped the top of the folder open, like there was something disgusting inside that I didn't want to touch. 

First page was categorized as "Dangerous." It was a pretty broad term that included things like that time that I'd worked the graveyard shift and decided to learn all I could about the Kennedy Assassination. Then there was the times that I'd googled how to build bombs, propaganda techniques... you know, things that would make me seem like some sort of supervillain or terrorist. "Well this is all..." I stuttered, looking back down at the page as though some explanation might jump out at me. "Look, there's...." I was just curious, I swear!

He cleared his throat and nodded down, asking me to flip to the next bookmark. I turned to the next section, titled "Porn." I don't need to even go into detail, but let's just say that there were some *unorthodox* searches that would probably send my mother into a coma if she ever read this page. Even reading the searches without seeing the results made me feel like I needed a shower. "I can't be the only one who has looked at..." I glanced back down at the page again. Ok, maybe I was.

"Now, is this really the sort of person we want working at Google?" the interviewer asked.

I bowed my head, and I was just empty inside. I'd gotten so far through the process. It was in my grasp... and now it was slipping away. "Look, it's probably too late to change your mind. But isn't this *why* we have the internet? So that we can explore curiosity without judgment and get real answers instead of asking someone who doesn't really know either? Should we *really* be condemning that?"

He snorted. "Oh, *that's* what you thought the issue was?" He leaned over his desk and tapped the right corner of every page, showing the *Bing* logo. "We don't care what you're searching for, we just have doubts about your *judgment.*"

I gave a sigh of relief and closed the folder as fast as possible. I didn't even want to see what other sections were in there. "I was only able to use Internet Explorer from my work computer, and Bing was the default that I couldn't change." I explained through a nervous smile. Hopefully he wouldn't make the connection that all of those searches had been *while I was at work*. 

"Ah!" He slid the folder off the side of his desk, stood up, and shook my hand. "Well in that case, welcome aboard!"

After yet another boring day at school, I got home, ready to make food and spend the entire night procrastinating. As I walked up, I noticed an abnormal number of cars littering the area, some even double-parked on our street. *Must be some kind of party. Damnit, Dad.*

The front door was unlocked, and the main room was entirely empty, but I could hear some commotion upstairs and slowly creeped up to see what was going on. There were at least fifty people packed into the upper floor, like sardines. I recognized a few of them as aunts or uncles, though some I'd never seen.

"Oh, sweetie, you're home. Come this way," my Aunt Jane said, planting a fat kiss on my forehead. She dragged me through the crowd and into my father's room, where my dad was bundled under the covers with an IV running into his arm.

"Hey, buddy," he said softly with a weak smile. I walked up to him and furrowed my brow.

"Dad, what's going on? Why are all these people here?"

He grabbed my hand and patted it. "I've been trying to keep this from you as long as possible, but I can't anymore."

"Dad, what are you talking about?" I asked wildly, heart pounding against my chest as if trying to break free. "I'm confused."

"Hi, Confused," he said, gripping my hand. A single tear flowed from his left eye. "I'm Dying."

"Everyone shut up and watch!"  An old man commanded.  

I felt a bead of sweat run down my forehead.  Every eye in the building was trained on me.  With a final twist of my hand I removed the tomato can's lid and placed it on the counter.

"He didn't cut himself?"

"How did he not spill it?"

A chorus of questions erupted around me.  Hands slapped me on the back in congratulation.  They happily paraded me to my next task to see if I could accomplish it.  Pouring laundry detergent.  Thunderous applause again as I did not spill a single drop on my white shirt.  The people were becoming more and more fanatical with every passing second.  Women were throwing themselves at me, men wanted to be me.  I felt like a god.  Until I felt something hit me in the back of the skull.

"Billy Mays here.  You know why I have called this meeting."  Billy Mays shouted.

Billy May's shouting woke me up, and amplified my splitting headache.  I tried to move but my legs and arms were tied to a chair.  

"What? Where am I?"  I said groggily.

"Where you are doesn't matter.  What does matter is you. Ruining. EVERYTHING!"  Billy's fist slammed down onto the table spilling drinks.  The other people at the table cursed quietly and got up to get paper towels.  

"No you morons, the sham-wow.  Jesus."  Billy shouted.

"Now.  Where was I,"  he paused for a second, "that's right.  Torturing you."  He stood up and approached me with a nasty looking pair of pliers.

"I see you admiring my pliers.  Well this is a six in one multi-tool that can tear you so many new ones you couldn't believe it.  And only for four easy payments of nineteen ninety nine.  A steal really."  He backhanded me, my teeth felt loose and my head rang.

"Why are you doing this?"  I pleaded.

"Because if people realize they can do things without all this useless shit, we will be ruined!"  He back handed me again.  I spit out a bit of blood.  The straps holding me down felt like they were getting looser.  I shifted in my seat.  Sure enough the strap holding my chest and arms slid down a fraction of an inch.

Billy saw me struggling against my bindings and laughed.  "Those straps can hold down a rhino.  I know I used them during my last trophy hunt."  He said wickedly.

"Grab me the clean.  We're going to drown him in it."  One of the others grabbed a large white and blue bucket and walked it over.  White water sloshed over the side with every step he took.  Billy squeezed his eyes shut and pressed his hand to his forehead.  "I swear to god, look at what you are doing!  Now you have to clean it up!  Use the two in one mop vacuum.  Cuts down on cleaning time by fifty percent!"  

While Billy was distracted yelling at his incompetent help I had been getting out of my bindings.  The straps on my feet fell away as I stood up, and the one that was on my chest and arms had fallen low enough I could undo the clip with my hands.

The man walking the bucket over saw me first.  

"B-b-b-"  He tried to stammer out.  

I threw a strap around Billy's neck and pulled tight.  I kicked the back of his knees out and he fell.  His face growing more blue with every second.  The others in the room did nothing.  They watched in horror as Billy's eyes bulged and his body spasmed for the last time. 

I stood over the corpse staring them down.  As one they fell to their knees and prostrated themselves in front of me.  

"Please don't hurt us!"  They cried out.

"No.  I have a better idea."

The infomercial ran on every channel every day in between peoples favorite shows.

"Introducing JOHN!  Are you sick and tired of not having something to worship?  Your god not doing a good enough job answering prayers?  Well look no further than JOHN!  He can do anything!  The best part?  To become a member of the Church of John all you need to do is send in just one easy payment of nineteen ninety nine!"

#### [WP] A young child summons a demon, but they only want a friend.

Score: 1586

"Are you sure about that?" the demon asked from inside the pentagram that had drawn on the floor in dust and candle wax. He'd arrived from the pits of Hell with horrid horns and terrible teeth, but all of that was gone now. He looked like someone you'd run into on the street, if you happened the run into pitch black shadows with yellow eyes.

Megan nodded.

"That's your command?"

Megan nodded for a second time and then coughed. The machine to her right beeped in protest.

"All right," he said. The glowing circle that was holding him in broke as he took the deal that Megan had offered him. He was to own her soul as soon as she died, but he was going to be her friend until then. 

Megan smiled and then waved him over to the bed she was sitting on. The demon looked from her to the foot of the bed and then plopped himself onto it. He stared at her, his eyes acting like a pair of headlights. He was frankly confused. Demons weren't exactly well versed in the 'best friends' department, but it was his job now. 

"Now what?" he asked.

Megan shrugged and laid down on the bed.

"I don't sleep," the demon explained.

Megan made a circle on her chest with her fist, and then closed her eyes. The Demon waited until morning.

The next morning was similar; the demon asked what to do, and Megan shrugged again. Frankly there wasn't much that you could do in the hospital without one of the nurses wagging a finger at you. Megan basically needed to stay in her bed, and that meant the Demon was going to as well. He did all of the talking while they were there. The Demon only left when the teacher came to remind her how to speak herself. 

In the afternoon the Demon brought her ice cream. She didn't ask how he got it or how he knew that her favorite flavor was chocolate. Megan just let him know that she loved it. He started to bring it every day.

Against the odds Megan ended up getting better, and the Demon was relieved. She was allowed out of the hospital and back into her school. She saw Sally, who knew what was going on, and the other girls who didn't have any idea where she went. Megan's mom had given her this little board that she could write on and clear. It was easier to talk like that than it was to use a language she barely knew. 

The other girls eventually stopped talking to Megan as much because she couldn't really talk back. Sally stopped talking to Megan because the rest of her friends weren't. The Demon still talked to Megan. He knew what she was saying no matter how many ways she said it. Sometimes she said things wrong but he didn't try to correct her. He just smiled with black teeth.

The Demon got Megan ice cream on her birthday again. It was almost their thing now, and as long as it was late at night nobody knew she was getting extra treats. She was ten, which meant she was pretty old.

When she was thirteen, they finally moved her schools. She'd taken to signing to the Demon when people were around, and that just wouldn't do. Her parents said something about isolation, and she didn't agree with them. The Demon didn't either, but she told him that her parents weren't bad people. He already knew that. 

She went to a school where everyone could sign, but nobody else liked the music that she did. In fact, none of them were into music at all. The demon continued to spend time with her, but she had to write to him now. The rest of the kids could hear her hands.

When she was 16, the Demon helped her learn to drive. Her father was trying, but he wasn't very good at it. The Demon wasn't a very good driver either; he'd never done it before, and it made things a little hard. Megan got used to it.On the way to university when she was 17, Megan got into a car crash. It wasn't that bad, but they needed to go to the hospital. The Demon sat beside her in the ambulance.

The nurses ended up putting her back in the same room that she'd summoned the Demon in. The cancer that had taken her voice was back, and it wasn't very happy about her beating it the first time. She lit up the CAT scan like a Christmas tree. She lost in early December.

The Demon didn't cry when Megan stopped breathing. He was calm when she flat-lined, and the Doctors started to panic. She'd been in a lot of pain for the past while, and he hadn't liked it. 

He held out a hand to her once she was pronounced dead, and she grabbed it while also staying still.After all, she'd lost to cancer, but she'd promised her soul to him, and they were friends.

#### [WP] The evacuation of Earth is complete. You decide to do one final fly over of the world to see the monuments deserted. However, you slowly realize something about them that no one ever has.

Score: 1440

Parts 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 are linked below!

*****

The radio crackled to life, snapping me from my hypnosis on the waves of endless clouds. "Charlie Unit, report when you make visual contact, over." I confirmed, thrusting the yoke forwards to duck beneath the clouds as my wings sliced a path through them for a moment before I emerged below. 

"Visual with Earth confirmed. She's ugly as ever. Over." The grey landscape made me shudder; mountains and hills steamed with escaping gasses, reminding me to snap on my oxygen tank before the air became too toxic to breathe. What were once luscious forests and deep blue seas were now fossilized wood and empty basins large enough to fit the entire evacuated population a thousand times.  Famine had come first as the food supplies and water ran out. Wars followed as countries jockeyed for power of the limited rations with the traditional powers emerging victorious. But in the end, the celebration of conquests was short-lived as leaders came to grips with reality and realized remaining on Earth meant certain death. That's how we wound up in outer space; searching desperately for a habitable planet as we wandered aimlessly in the barely adequate motherships.

"Steer for 29 dot 9792 north, 31 dot 1342 east. Should see pyramids if they're still above ground. Do you copy?" I confirmed, repeating the numbers back to them, and sped towards the ancient monuments, long since abandoned as the land grew brittle and inhospitable. The pyramids were smaller than I remembered from pictures, courtesy of a thick layer of ash and dirt that had built around their base. The Sphinx peeked out nearby, only its eyes visible now. They stared at me ominously as I touched down; the last living creature to be on our once beautiful planet. The scientists claimed that the Earth's core had grown cold but no proposed solution worked and everything had fallen apart as we watched and warred like savages over the rapidly dwindling supplies.

"Visual contact confirmed. Pyramids are intact. Landing now. Out." I slowly hovered to the ground near the largest pyramid, taking care to touch down on a solid-looking patch. My orders were to only make visual contact but I figured no harm in exploring a bit. I had never had the chance to visit the pyramids while civilization bloomed. An item to cross off my bucket list now, it seemed. Donned in the safe-suit and with the oxygen tank strapped to my back, I grabbed the grapple I had smuggled aboard my craft and started the short but arduous trek towards the pyramid. The world reeked of noxious fumes that found their way to me in spite of the helmet I wore. And death. It smelled of death and looked of death and everything emanated death. I gagged softly before regaining my composure.

The pyramid loomed above me, massive in spite of the portion buried below. With a grin and a habitual glance around for any superiors who might reprimand me, I shot the grapple towards the top of the pyramid and steadily made my way upwards. Ashen winds whipped around me, stirring up vortices of the dust that had dealt death to billions as we scrambled to evacuate. I reached the top short of breath and sweating as the Sun beat down mercilessly on the endless wasteland. Looking out, I could see where the city once stood, only the top of buildings signalling that we had ever even lived here. Morbid and disgusting yet oddly beautiful.

I struggled to catch my breath, awed by the enormity of the emptiness we had left behind. Just a couple years back, the ground below would have been bustling with thousands of tourists as they gaped at the massive structure. Now there was nothing; not even Nature had survived the brutal apocalypse. Leaning back against the apex of the pyramid, I jumped and nearly became Earth's final victim as the top caved inwards, revealing a passageway into the depths of the abandoned monument.

"Base, this is Charlie Unit..." I paused, still struggling to understand what I was seeing.

"We copy, Charlie Unit. Is there an issue? All we needed you to check was that the pyramid was in fact intact. Nothing more. Over." The voice sounded harsh over the intercom, scolding me even as I took in the last of our planet. I shook my head numbly as I cautiously shone my flashlight into the abyss.

"I... I'm at the top of the pyramid," I started slowly, knowing I would be punished for my transgression upon my return to the motherships. "And... Well, the top just opened. There's a passage way into the pyramid... Permission to enter? Over." I stepped inside, knowing permission would be denied but that I had to see where the passageway led, the boy in me urging me to explore. I thought back to my history lessons back when the Earth was friendly and painted blue and green. No teacher had ever mentioned a passageway at the top of the pyramids or even a way to enter the massive structures.

"Permission denied. Abort mission immediately. I repeat, you do not have permission to enter the pyramid. Do you copy?" A tinge of desperation edged the voice as it repeated itself. I scowled and would have spat had my breathing apparatus not prevented me. Ignoring the orders from base, I carefully stepped down the stairway as it spiraled downwards into the darkness.

#### [WP] We've explored more of the lunar surface than the bottom of the ocean. NASA knows what's down there, and it trying to get us off Earth as fast as possible

Score: 1383

It's called the Fermi Paradox, the fact that in a universe that should be teeming with intelligent life we have heard nothing from our neighbors. That where space should be a cacophony of cultures all shouting to the cosmos 'we exist' there is only dead chill silence.  It should not puzzle us,  every day when we see the flash of sinister movement outside our windows or hear the sudden creaking of the floor elsewhere in the house we pause and even our breathing stills. When we are afraid we go still and silent, and all of those civilizations in space are afraid. They are so tremendously, very, afraid because they REMEMBER. 


We humans call our planet Earth, soil, so integral is the land to our identity it seems that nothing else exists but the oceans are larger and they came first. Before life ever awkwardly flopped its way onto soil it grew in the depths, before humankind ever used its wits to become the fiercest killers on land yet others were using theirs to become the butchers of the sea. 


It is humankind that has forgotten, forgotten that the land was no prize to be claimed but rather the distant shore to flee too. That for all that we are, we fled those even more intelligent and more malicious than ourselves. 
When those on land go missing humans spin tales of aliens coming to carry them away, of tests and needles. When ships go missing we do not question it, we feel no need to spin such theories because deep in our collective unconscious we know. The depths are deadly, do not venture there. 


We have ventured there, of course, our sonar echoing and hulls straining to hold themselves together. Initially assumed remnants of some ancient civilization it was NASA scientists and their more modern understanding that finally put meaning to those lines and shapes as launch facilities. Those scientists that finally identified  the gunships, the missiles, the bombs. The great slaughtering race the galaxy fears is not on some distant shore looking towards the heavens but rather beneath our very own waves. 


The cold war was a sham to build enough bombs, the space race necessary testing and the later near collapse of the space program all a ruse to hide the construction of the generation ships. Project Victus is nearly complete, if all goes well soon the ships will rise and humankind will flee the smoldering cinder that Earth has become. We only pretend to fear the day we leave a dead world behind us. It's our greatest hope.

#### [WP] You work in tech support. One day you receive a call from someone you begin to suspect is God and, boy, is he mad.

Score: 1372

There were two beeps in my headset as the call came through and immediately I could hear muffled swearing down the line. I always preferred being friendly, but sometimes with difficult calls it was better to be slightly sharp and officious, to keep people from getting too carried away; I called it my bitch voice. 

"Hi, you're through to the faults team at MegaNet, my name is Emily, can I take your account number please?" The voice was still muffled and so I tried again a little louder. "*Hello*, you're through to Emily, can I *take* your account number. To my left Jack looked across and smiled, he knew my bitch voice and could sense that this was going to be an interesting call. 

My voice must have filtered through this time and there was the noise of the phone being brought up suddenly to the callers face. "Oh, uh yeah, what do you need from me?" 

I let the silence go just long enough to show my displeasure. "Your account number, *Sir*." 

"Shit, account number... uh, look Emily, I don't have a clue. The problem is that my wifi is out and I need to get it up as I have people coming round and..."

"*Sir*," I interrupted, the bitch voice growing ever less friendly. "Without access to your account I am unable to help you. If you do not have your account number to hand then can you give me your address?" 

The phone went muffled again, as if he had pressed it against his chest. "She wants the address." There was laughter in the background. "Uh, no honey, that's not going to work, I'm not going to be on the system with an address." 

I looked across at Jack, who was smirking as I rolled my eyes. "Sir, *all* accounts have an address, it's where we connect your internet."

There was a long sigh. "Uuuuuh, okay Emily, tell you what, we'll use an account number." 

"Oh, you have your account number now do you sir?" My voice could've cut glass. 

"Just go ahead and put one into the box and pull it up." 

I waited for the rest of the numbers. "It's an eight digit number sir and can be found on your bill or on your..." 

"Just throw it in sweetie and hit your big white enter key underneath the picture of your cat stuck to the monitor and see what happens." Smugness oozed from his voice 

I took a breath to stay calm, he was right about the picture, lucky guess. "Sir, if you won't give me your number then I am unable to..." 

His voice lowered and became soft. "Do it Emily." My fingers had moved without my conscious involvement and an account was showing on my screen. 

I blinked and peered forward. The details were... correct and all in order, but just a little... difficult to see. I leaned back and rubbed my eyes and tried again. I could *see* the account details, name, address, all of the usual and I could understand them, but at the same time I had no idea what was in front of me. 

"Uh... I'm going to have to ask you a few security questions Sir." I waved frantically at Jack and pointed at my screen. He pushed off his desk and trundled across to me, the wheels on his chair squeaking as he moved across the grey industrial carpet.

He came back immediately. "No, let's just get on with this." 

"Okay, no problem, how can I help." The words had *come* from me, but again I felt as if they had bypassed my actual involvement. Nevertheless I didn't seem to be able to take them back and all I could hope was that this wouldn't be one of my calls that got monitored. Jack was squinting at the screen, moving his head in and out, but seemed no more able than I was to see anything.

The caller sounded slightly annoyed. "First up, tell Jack to piss off and stop looking at your screen." 

I jolted back in my seat and looked around. "Is this a joke? What's going on?" 

They sighed. "No, just... look, my wifi router is broken, the little lights are flashing but I get no connection. What do I do?" 

"Uuuuhhhh, have you tried turning it off and on again." 

There was a pause. "Oh shit." The phone went muffled. "Did we turn it off and on again?" He came back a moment later. "Hang on." 

I heard muffled thumps and then thirty or so seconds later he eturned again. "Shiiiit, that worked Emily. Man I feel stupid as hell. Tell you what, to make up for wasting your time I'll do you a favour." His voice lowered again. "What do you desire more than any other thing in the entire world." 

A million images flooded my mind; money, fame, power, all seemed within my grasp, but it wasn't what I wanted *most* and I couldn't lie, not to him. 

"I want it to beep once, not twice when a new call comes through." 

Laughter flooded down the line. "You got it girl." 

There was a click as he hung up and I was left staring at the account that I couldn't read, until a second later it flicked away and the normal screen returned. I looked to Jack, who was still sitting beside me, looking puzzled. My mouth opened but I had no idea how to explain what had just happened.  

There was no time to figure it out and with only ten seconds between calls it was probably better not to try. My phone beeped once and I was connected to the next caller.

#### [WP] You are a professional assassin for the CIA. But you are also a double agent. One day, you are assigned with killing a foreign agent. This foreign agent is your other alias.

Score: 1323

"I want confirmed kill in twenty-four hours, understood?"

I sat completely still on the other end of the line. It was secure, as was all of my communications with the CIA, but this one was the most important call I had ever received. "Understood, sir."

"This is *the* target we've been hunting for the past twenty-two years. You remember him I'm sure, he disrupted you in Venice. He's finally slipped up."

"I'm going over all of it now, sir. The file is secured."

"Good luck."

"Thank you, sir."

I hung up the phone with a satisfied clunk and took one of the longest, and deepest, breaths I had ever taken. It had been a long time since I heard the name that my *Commander* had just spoke on the phone. Even longer since I even cared about it. And yet, here I was, with the file a few feet from my shoes, delivered by an unsuspecting intern, in a brown manila envelope.

I was in South America. On a mission to make sure a drug deal in the area went sour, which would ultimately end in the entire area spiraling out of control. I had already seen parts of my work begin, with fires spreading and civilian evacuating. I was done. And my next mission was to be all that bigger.

I had been with the CIA for twenty-seven years, acting as a professional assassin for the better part of the last two decades. Highly trained, extremely dangerous, and in any part of the world at any different country. I already knew where I needed to go when I heard him tell me the name. I wasn't looking forward to it to say the least. To be quite honest, I wanted to go home and visit my family in America.

But orders are orders and I as grabbed the envelope off the floor I knew this order was going to be the hardest one to accomplish. I slid my finger under the seal and opened it in one swoop. The file was thin, only a few pages. *Nikolai Vinokurov*, former KGB agent operating in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, who went off the grid after that. The file didn't contain a photo of him, but his trail had slipped up. 

In South America.

Convenient.

I skimmed through the file. All of it was still there. The only addition they had added to it was an addendum at the end of the last page, after classifying him as a priority target. I read through it once.

*Transmission intercepted in Brazil on July 17th, 2017. Encryption was heavy, but trace contains Russian backwater company located in the city. Most likely used as a proxy. Mission Alert: Target location identified.*

I had screwed up. I, of course, needed to send my superiors the mission details of disrupting the drug cartel; one in which they had long agreed was necessary. But I had messed up. The proxy wasn't secure or I had used the wrong pass phrase with the Russian business. Ever since the dissolution of the KGB in the early 90's, the general pass phrases and such just seemed like ordinary conversation to other native Russians. I had lost more than half my contacts in those days.

Now, I must've lost more. And I knew if I had messed up here in South America, it would seen be traced. The age of spies had ended long ago and I was lucky enough not to end up on the chopping block like the rest of my comrades. I had survived all of it. The Red Scare that lasted well into the 70's and 80's. The age when spies became obsessions in pop culture. The age of information. It was all in my past and as far as I knew, I was just about the Russian's last spy in the CIA.

I had considered giving it up. Just abandoning all transmission sources with the KGB and the Intelligence Service in each decade. When the times got tough. Russia was as much my home as the boat that took me to America when I was a teenager. The *real* Nikolai Vinokurov had died in South Vietnam, and I was called upon to take his place when I was only twenty. I had grown up in America, played with Americans, dated Americans. Hell, I had married an American. But I was always loyal to the Motherland. I was always a compatriot in their fight.

When the other spies began to be outed, when men and women I recognized from training were shown in newspaper and TV I panicked, but I did not slip up. I faltered, but I did not lose the fight. Yet now, holding Nikolai's file in my hand once again and seeing everything they said *he* did, and not knowing all the things *I* did as him. Well, right then and there I knew. I wasn't a Russian. I was an American.

Faking a death would be easy. We were trained how to do that long ago. But I didn't want to fake *my* death. I didn't want to fake Jeremy White's death. I wanted to kill Nikolai Vinokurov. I wanted to finish him and be done with the spy life.

I wanted to go home and see my wife and kids. To say hello to my neighbors and cut my lawn. I wanted to smell the fresh air of America because it was the only air I had memories in. Russia, it was just a figment in my mind. My home country yes, but not my country. Not my people.

As I stood there, in that shotty little South American apartment with Nikolai's file in my hand I realized something. Something I had realized a long time ago but never wanted to admit I think. I knew, then and there, that the world didn't need spies anymore. Countries didn't need double agents. Countries needed peace; and the people just needed to survive.

#### [WP] Write a seemingly normal story, except for the last sentence, which makes the entire story creepy

Score: 1284

I lie in bed, listening to the rain gently pattering on the skylight.  How did I get so lucky, I wonder?  I roll over gently, smiling at the sleeping form next to me.  The love of my life, she lies there sleeping.  She's on her side, facing away from the window - she never did like nighttime storms as much as I did.  I caress her gently, from her shoulder down to her hip, but I stop when she starts to stir - as much as I love her, I'd hate to wake her.  Though she doesn't have my insomnia, she still never gets enough sleep.  Someone has to look out for her health.  So I resume my quiet introspection as the wind stirs the damp leaves outside.  How lucky am I, to have been with the woman I love every single night for two years?  Never a night apart, even when we travel.  It fills me with so much joy that I think, for a moment anyways, that tomorrow might be the day.  Tomorrow, I might finally find the courage to introduce myself to her.

#### [WP] Aliens have finally reached Earth and, per Intergalactic Law, have sent their most average champion to win the planet. A device is sent to find the most average human to accept the challenge and duel for the fate of Earth. It's you.

Score: 1242

The gigantic stage was, frankly, a little unnecessary in my eyes, but they kept telling me over and over again that the TV networks had demanded it and so I had no choice. It had only been three days since they had come for me, the government van pulling up to my door and then the thunderous knocking until I answered. I suppose I could have said no then, but when the President of the USA asks a favour… well, it becomes tricky to refuse. 

The alien ship had landed in the middle of London, crushing about a square mile of densely populated housing, but that had soon been forgotten as soon as they stepped out onto their little balcony and started their broadcast. For Earth it was the first communication from a species born on another planet, but they didn't seem to be particularly worried. 

Hundreds of TV cameras focussed in on the tall green creature as it gracefully extended six arms from its body and grasped a piece of the ship that had unfolded up to where it’s ‘head’ seemed to be. It looked from side to side and then leaned in. A complex series of grunts and hums emerged from its body and for a moment there was a tinge of disappointment from the crowd, before the translation kicked in and it blared out in English from somewhere behind the alien. 

“**EARTH**, you have been challenged to the *ULTIMATE TEST OF A SPECIES.* The triphosphic people of Merillium have send out a CHALLENGE and YOU MUST reply. If you accept then you will need to nominate the statistically most normal human to fight to go up against the representative of Merillium in the *ultimate challenge*.”

“Should you prevail, you will be given your choice of technologies, including anti-gravity, interstellar space flight and the secret to getting stubborn stains out of cloth and fabric without bleaching. *What is your answer*?” 

It’s hard to know exactly what it accepted as its answer, but the massive cheer that followed its speech seemed to satisfy it. Most people who were there on that day now claim that they were just happy that they alien hadn’t immediately begun vaporising people and hadn’t even really been able to hear what it said, but the die was cast. 

That led to me. We had 24 hours to prepare and a mammoth task was undertaken by governments all over the world. After mass analysis of billions of people it turned out that I was the most “average” of all of humanity. Average height, weight, intelligence and even, sad to say, genital length, I was right in the middle of them all. 

Soon I was on a flight, heading for London with a dozen generals at my side, all briefing me on what to look for, what to say and how to act, but no one seemed to have any idea what I was about to come up against. By the time I arrived they had bulldozed several streets in front of the ship and created a wide flat area with a *massive* stage set up on it. Hundreds of cameras lined every area and the crowds had been pushed far, far back. 

I stood in the middle of the stage with Helena Campano, Spanish TV presenter and the chosen host of this unique TV spectacle and listened as she babbled away into her microphone. My eyes were glued to the ship, just waiting for something to emerge. At last, a crack appeared and a great ramp began to swing down, it was time. 

The green alien came first, dragging behind him a white box and then after him came a yellow creature that seemed to hiss in the air as it walked. Many scientists had speculated that a triphosphic alien would have difficulty surviving on our planet and so it seemed to be proving, but still they moved forward until they stood opposite me. 

Helena had moved back and I could hear her speaking rapid Spanish somewhere behind me but it was the alien whose voice was loudest. He seemed to still connect to his ship and the translations blared out at incredible volume. 

“WELCOME, this will be a single round fight TO THE DEATH.” He paused as if expecting applause but none was forthcoming. “PREPARE yourself human.” 

He stepped back and I was left facing the yellow hissing… thing. It was a shambling, roughly humanoid alien, with large black eyes at the top of its head and long arms that hung low, almost to the ground. I backed away, trying to get some sort of distance on the creature in front of me, but it shuffled after me quickly. 

A fight to the death? This was not exactly what I had signed up for… but it had been a possibility. There had been soldiers at one point, I think maybe SAS and they had tried to teach me some basic moves, but it had all been a blur. What was it they had said? Something about hitting hard and fast and hoping like hell. 

It came closer and on instinct I took a low clumsy swing with my foot and connected on what might have been its leg. It paused, looked down at where I had hit it and then exploded into a yellow cloud that covered the surrounding area in a thick yellow goo and sent the first alien scurrying back to my side. 

“CONGRATULATIONS humanity, your representative has been victorious and now it is time to choose your prize.” 

They had all been very specific about this and as the alien shoved his microphone type object in my face I spoke clearly. “Interstellar space flight, please.”

I was surprised that my voice was not amplified like the aliens, there was no noise at all from the giant speakers and just some grunts from the beast that went untranslated, but it replied almost immediately anyway. “WELL DONE and excellent choice human. You have chosen the secret to getting stubborn stains out of cloth and fabric without bleaching.” 

My head twisted around and I could suddenly see angry faces all around the stage. “Wait, what? No, hang on...” 

It ignored me and moved over to the white box and pulled out a brightly coloured package. Its voice had dropped low and silky. “Whether you are fighting an alien species or just keeping the kids clothes clean, you can trust in XXIXAK cleaner to get oil, blood or even Merillium goo out of any of your materials.” 

I felt a hand pulling at my clothes and a second later it had pulled off my jumper and stuffed it into the white box. “Look at how it keeps the colours fresh and the clothes crisp.” it pulled out my jumper and it was indeed very clean looking, but I felt it would be a poor move to compliment it. 

The alien looked around. “Now, as a species, how many packs can I put you down for?”

#### [WP] A modern teenager is transported into a fantasy world, where they are forced into a quest with young witches and wizards their age. Fortunately, they've got a backpack full of high-tech gizmos to help them along.

Score: 1164

I stared at the wizened old man in front of me. I didn't even know how I had gotten here - wherever *here* was. I remembered opening my notebook for Chemistry, only instead of yesterday's notes about covalent bonds there was a bright purple portal that sucked me to friggin' Narnia or whatever.

"A noble quest? Seriously?" I rolled my eyes. "How cliche can you get? Wait, wait, don't tell me, there's an ancient prophecy saying that some unknown hero will come from a far-off land and defeat the ancient evil and bring a new era of peace and prosperity to the land?"

The old man paused with his mouth open for several seconds. Yeah, that confirms that. Stupid prophecies, never liked the things.

"It doesn't matter if there's a prophecy, Taylor!" he finally snapped. "If nothing else, do it for the knowledge that you're helping us, that you're bettering yourself!"

"Blah blah," I said, rolling my eyes again. "Whatever. I'll do it. Now I've seen how these stories work, you've probably got a group to help me already picked out, right?"

"You.... You have helped other lands from evils such as this?" The man laughed with joy. "Then perhaps we have hope after all! Come, come meet your fellow adventurers!"

He grabbed my by the hand, and I almost tripped over my backpack, which I suddenly realized had been dragged through the portal with me by snagging on my leg. I bent down and threw it over my shoulder. It would probably be more comfortable than whatever packs these people had. And besides, my iPod and my Kindle were in there. Wherever the "ancient evil" was, we weren't going to be getting there any time soon, and I had no intention of getting bored.

We reached the back of his cabin and I saw two other children around my own age, sparring. One was a tall handsome boy wearing heavy armor and twirling a sword as though it were a natural extension of his body, and the other was a scrawny girl with long flowing robes who was deflecting his blows using some form of magic. I couldn't help but laugh at the cliche-ness of the whole situation, which drew their attention to us. They approached us, both glancing me over before turning to the old man.

"Is this the best you could bring us?" the boy asked haughtily. "She doesn't look like she could last a minute in a fight!"

"Hush, Thomas," the girl said quietly. "You cannot see her aura as I can. There is something different about her, an aspect to her aura I have never before seen."

"Yeah, yeah, we start off disliking each other until the first accident on our little quest, at which point we realize that everyone needs everyone else and we all hold hands and sing Kumbaya," I muttered. "So what's this quest all about, anyway? 'Ancient evil' doesn't exactly narrow it down. What're we dealing with? World-eating dragon? Immortal demigod? A boy band?"

The old man gestured us to a table, where a map had been laid out. Pointing to a fortress shaped like a skull - I swear, I could not make this up - and said "Here is the stronghold of the Necromancer of Rek'shan. He has held the world in his grip for generations, only pockets of resistance capable of -"

I interrupted him. "... Capable of standing against him, surviving in secret until true heroes can yadda yadda yadda. Great. Does he have a weakness or anything?"

The old man pointed at the boy. "His sword is forged from star-metal, from the star that fell when the Necromancer rose to power. The planets shall align in mere weeks. Should he be stabbed with this sword in this time, he will be defenseless."

Typical.

_____________________

It took us two weeks to get to the fortress. Two weeks of living outside, not even making a fire so as to hide from... whatever they called the legions of doom or whatever, it was awful. There was a part of me that was glad to be about to fight the Necromancer, if only because it meant we would be inside.

"There are three doors, tests, barriers to entry," said Athgar, the witch-girl, as we slowly approached the main gate. "Legend says that the first door is opened by a test of magic, so I'll be the one to do that. The second door is opened by a test of resolve, so that will probably be Thomas. The third door is a test of knowledge, so... We'll see who can deal with that."

"What, you don't think it'll be one test for each of us?" I asked sarcastically.

"Need I remind you of three days ago," asked Thomas, "when you mistook poison elm for maple when relieving yourself? I hardly think you can be counted on for a test of knowledge."

My retort was cut short by movement at the gate. We had arrived, and the test was beginning. Two large gargoyles flanking the gate came to life at our approach. One opened its mouth to speak.

*If ye seek entry, a test you must pass. Only those strong in magic can succeed.*

Agathar stepped forward. "Let my magic be tested!" she said loudly. The second gargoyle responded.

*Make ye a light to shine into my eyes. But be warned: if the light doth enter my brother's eye, ye shall fail.*

Agathar paled. Turning to us, she whispered "Guys.... I don't know if I can do that... They're so close, anything I do to one would be seen by the other... The only option I'm seeing -"

"Oh for crying out loud, get out of the way," I snapped, bending down to dig through my backpack. Why is it that everything you need falls down to the bottom when you need it?

Standing up, I turned to the gargoyles and aimed my laser pointer directly into the statue's eye. Magic, photon receptor, it's all the same deal. The gargoyles stirred, then returned to their positions alongside the gate.

*Your magic is strong. You may pass.*

The gate swung open.

__________________________

"Okay, the test of resolve," said Thomas. "Seems to be something behind this door, can you hear it?"

I could. It was like a faint screaming. Stepping forward, I put my hand flat against the door.

"Definitely a lot of noise in there. You can feel the vibrations."

"The Hall of Wailing!" Agathar exclaimed. "It's full of banshees.... I thought it was a myth! Supposedly they'll only stop their wailing if someone can open the door at the other end of the hall. They usually drive people insane before then though."

"How do we get me through?" Thomas asked.

"Well, in the stories an ancient druid got through by filling his ears with beeswax, but we don't exactly have any of that... We could try making do with cotton, but... Taylor! What are you do- AAAGGGGHHHH!"

I opened the door and slipped through. Apparently the noise was deafening, even outside. I hoped they would be okay, but for the time being I had bigger things to worry about.

The hall was bigger than I had expected. Must have been two football fields across. Above me I could see the spectral banshees, mouths agape, screaming endless screams. When I finally reached the opposite side and threw open the door, they and their screams vanished into nothingness.

I turned and began to walk back, but my companions were already entering. Apparently their hearing wasn't gone permanently, that was good. I leaned against the doorway and waited for them to reach me.

"By the gods, what were you thinking?" Agathar shouted at me. "You could have been killed!"

"More importantly," said Thomas slowly, "how didn't you?"

I pulled my headphones out of my ears, and reaching into my pocket, turned off my iPod.

"I went through a Scene phase when I was younger. Never cleared this thing off. So I threw on some Evanescence. I figured if you're already listening to one wailing banshee, what're a few more?"

The human slid out from under the ship, blinking as he came back into the light. The expression on his face made me worried that I would be stuck here for even longer; I had already been on this technology-forsaken world for half a local rotation, and I had no desire to spend any more time than was absolutely necessary.

"How long's it been since ya put oil in this thing?" he asked.

I blinked.

"Ummm.... In local time...." I quickly punched some numbers into my wristband calculator. "It's been.... two thousand and sixty three rota... days."

The mechanic's eyes widened. "It's been six years since ya got yourself an oil change?! Well there's your problem! Can't imagine the hell you've been puttin' on your engine.... Well that should be an easy fix at least. Mkay, gimme ten."

Before I could ask him what "Ten" meant, he had grabbed a large black bottle and disappeared back under the ship.

A short time later he slid back out and signaled for me to climb into the cockpit. Upon seeing that I was settled, he placed a pair of headphones over his ears and told me to try to start the ship. Once again, I heard the sputtering sound of the hyperdrive failing to complete initiation. I shook my head. Another failure. And this planet was supposed to have the best mechanics.

I turned to thank him for his attempt, only to see that he had climbed up next to the window to stare in at the control panel.

"Whassat blinking light?" he asked.

I looked where he pointed. "That's the hyperdrive light, the whole reason I'm in here in the first place."

"Oh!" he said with glee. "Well why didn't ya say so? I tell ya, people come in here all the time sayin' their stuff don't work and they don't know why, when it's sayin' it right there! So, this light, it's not s'pposed to be blinking, is it?"

"Well.... No," I said, confused. "It's supposed to be solid, but that means there's a problem with the engine."

"Kid," said the mechanic with a laugh. "That ain't an engine problem, that's a computer problem. And there's only one way to fix a computer problem."

He leaned in close.

"Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

#### [WP] It is illegal to contact the humans, as they wear an evolutionary scar from their time as prey. It is known as "fear" and it makes them volatile and unpredictable.

Score: 1108

Most species in the Council have always been the dominant species of their respective planet. The Garth were the first predators on their planet, and were such efficient hunters that no other predatory species was able to evolve. The Mik'thar, with their hive mind, were able to arrange ambushes that no animal on their world could withstand.

The Terrans, however, are only recently the dominant species. They are a young species, only existing for a thousandth of a galactic cycle, and their dominance has been only a tenth of that. For ninety percent of their existence, they were both predator and prey. They would hunt what they called a "mammoth", while at the same time watching behind themselves to ensure that they were not being hunted by a "sword-tooth tiger". This unique development gave the humans something that no other known sapient species has.

It gave them fear.

I see you whispering amongst yourselves. I imagine what you are saying... "Does he mean to say that we do not feel fear?" You do not understand.

The species of the Council feel fear in the highest levels of consciousness. We determine that there is a way in which an endeavor could fail, and, in hopes that it does not, take action to avoid failure. We call this desire to avoid failure, fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection. On a battlefield, some may experience fear of death, but even that is primarily used to focus on the most reasonable course of action.

The Terrans are different.

Their fear is not the result of higher-level thought determining that something could end badly. Their fear is tied deeply to their evolutionary history, and as such is biological, existing on a subconscious level beyond many Terrans' control. When a Terran feels fear, it is not a tool to seek the most reasonable course of action.

It is a tool to ensure survival.

Fear throws a Terran back into the middle of their species evolution, to the time where every rotation was a struggle for their very survival. The Terrans have many terms to describe this sort of survival struggle. "Dog eat dog", referring to their world's *canis* species, for example. Perhaps most chilling, "Kill or be killed".

Fear for Terrans is not a rational process. This on the screen is a picture of what the Terrans refer to as a "spider". Spiders are generally smaller than a Terran's thumb, and yet it is estimated that five percent of Terrans have a deep-seeded fear of spiders. Other common fears are enclosed spaces, high places, and darkness. None of these are rational fears, and the Terrans themselves admit so. They simply accept the fears as a part of their lives.

It would be one thing if they simply had irrational fears that existed on a subconscious level. Every species in the Council has its quirks. The problem is that their fear runs deep enough, is old enough, that it has affected their evolution. When Terrans feel fear, there is a part of their brain organ that begins to excrete [adrenaline]. Their brains naturally produce combat drugs!

The Terrans feel fear deeper than any other species of the Council, for irrational reasons, and become unpredictable and combative when they do so. It is my proposal, therefore, that we cut all present and future ties with them, for preservation of ourselves.

I am sure you feel the same fear that I do.

#### [WP] A "popular" girl falls in love with a "nerdy" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him

Score: 1101

Samantha couldn’t help herself.  Every boy in the school was chasing her.  A lot of them had already had her and wanted more.  She enjoyed teasing them.  It was all too easy.

&nbsp;

They say forbidden fruit is the finest.  After gorging herself on so much adoration, it was the only thing that Samantha could taste at all.  It was no surprise then that she found herself falling for the first boy who simply didn’t seem to care about her.

&nbsp;

At first she’d assumed it was just because he thought he had no chance with her.  It was true of course, there was no way she’d even bother speaking to a loser like him, she’d thought.  It still irked her that he wouldn’t even throw a glance her way.

&nbsp;

It annoyed her enough that she broke her cardinal rule and actually stooped to speaking to the little mouth breather.  She teased, she flirted, he barely looked up from his textbook.  He was getting good grades, it’s not like he had anything else going for him.  He was distinctly average, no skills, no friends, nothing to make him at all noteworthy.  Yet he somehow thought he could ignore her advances?  This wasn’t going to stand.

&nbsp;

Subtlety went out the window as the months rolled past.  At first she’d been worried that pursuing him would make her look bad in front of her friends.  By the end she didn’t care, this was a point of pride for Samantha and she was going to break his resistance.  They mysteriously ended up in the same group for every project, she sat with him at lunch and tried to strike up conversation, shot him glances across the room and everything else she’d ever read about in Cosmo.

&nbsp;

Rumours started to swirl around the school.  It didn’t take a sharp eye to spot her pursuit of the poor little nerd.  Mixed with the level of envy that constantly swirled around Samantha’s clique it made for an explosive scandal.  Everyone was talking about Samantha and her would-be paramour – everyone but he himself.

&nbsp;

He shrugged off confessions, ignored thinly veiled propositions and just generally remained oblivious.  He had to be doing it on purpose, Samantha decided.  Well, if subtlety – what little she’d exercised – didn’t work, then maybe she’d just come out and say it.  It was social suicide, but what had started as a minor annoyance had wormed its way deep enough into her insecurities that she no longer cared.

&nbsp;

She cornered him behind the bike shed during their lunchbreak.  She’d spent so much time sitting here with him, suggestively playing with the hem of her skirt and the buttons on her blouse while he stared at his goddamn textbooks.

&nbsp;

Samantha took a deep breath and prepared herself to throw away what little dignity she had left.  This had gone on far too long.

&nbsp;

“So, you know how prom’s coming up?” she asked, twirling a loose hair around her finger as she smiled coquettishly at the only man who’d ever resisted her substantial charms.

&nbsp;

“Uh, yeah,” he croaked.  Even his voice was awkward.  It was absurd that he wouldn’t leap at the chance to get with this.

&nbsp;

“Well, I don’t have a date, do you?”

&nbsp;

“Ugggh, no.”

&nbsp;

“So maybe we should go together.  I think you’re super cute.”

&nbsp;

“Er, Samantha, I…”

&nbsp;

“You will!” she excitedly finished the sentence for him, “great!  You can pick me up at six.  I’m going to wear pink, so pick a tux that compliments it, ok?”

&nbsp;

“Uggh, Samantha, I’m…I’m gay,” he finished with an apologetic shrug at the crestfallen cheerleader.

Score: 1096

"Oh no", cried Leltarth, "not on the rug, not on the rug!" 

The bipedal little thing looked quizzically up from the wet patch on the floor, then smiled, burbled, and fell slowly onto its face. Leltarth sighed and gently pushed it upright with one of her spindly insectile limbs. A com-pad nearby began pulsing, informing her that Konnal was checking up on her progress.

"Accept call" she clattered. The misshapen blob looked up with eyes wide, then started to cry loudly. Leltarth rattled her leg spines in frustration, which the creature seemed to find soothing.

"Leltarth, how is your evaluation of the forerunner paleospecies progressing?"

"Not well, I'm afraid. The clone is completely helpless. At first I thought we might have made a mistake, so I went over the reconstruction and cloning transcripts but they're all perfect. But, well..."

"Yes?"

She thrummed her legs nervously as she fought with herself over the controversial hypothesis, the baby staring in rapt attention, apparently fascinated by the gyrations. 

"Konnal, what if their larval form was born with only minimal instincts? What if they didn't have the level of intergenerational memory transfer we take for granted?" 

Konnal remained silent, then cautiously spoke.

"It's an *interesting* idea with some precedents among known pre-sentient species, but do you really think its likely that a civilisation could reach the level of technological sophistication we've seen out there? They'd have to spend..." silence again as he made rough calculations "...the first decade or so of their lives just to become somewhat functional, and even longer to reach a point where they would be contribute to building something like the temples on Ull, or the rings of Nihar." The baby began chewing its own foot.

"That's more or less the conclusion I came to. Can you imagine such a society? The burden of raising each new child? And the fragility of it all! But it could make sense of certain peculiarities we've seen. For example, it certainly sheds a new light on the sheer volume of external recordings they left- if an individual died, anything they had failed to record would be lost. And I think I have some interesting new ideas about their so-called 'temples' which explain their layout and certain artifacts. To me, such sites are starting to look more like places where one generation could train the next. Just an idea at this point of course, but I think it might bear further study"

Konnal mused on his colleague's ideas. They were radical, certainly, but maybe she had a point. But there was a problem, wasn't there?

"Leltarth, this is fascinating but you realise what this means for our original project if true?"

Leltarth whistled sadly.

"Yes. If they did not transfer their knowledge genetically, cloning is a dead-end. We may have to fall back on analysing their written records, which could take centuries."

She turned back and gazed, partly in reverence and partly in disappointment, at the tiny human clone who was busily trying to eat the corner of her desk. It was going to be a long few decades.

I remember dying. It was like watching the world get foggy and fade out. 

Then I was standing in a room with a sign that said **Welcome to Hell!**. The sign was flashing, lighting up in red and traveling around the colors like some sort of Las Vegas Strip joint - catching your eye and blinking. I stood and watched it for a long time before a sharply dressed man came out to meet me.

"Welcome to Hell!" he said. "My name is Sunny, and I'll be your guide today."

"Your name is...nevermind. Hi, Sunny." 

"Hello! If you'll just follow me we can begin our tour!" 

I followed Sunny. He walked with an odd gait - like one leg was longer than the other. He led me through another tunnel and out into a large room with high ceilings around its edges. 

"On your left you'll see our day spa, where you can bask in the glory of hellfire for as long as you'd like. On the right we have our hospital &mdash;"

"Hell has a hospital?" I asked.

"Well of course! It's very up-to-date, we have the latest research and development techniques for the psychological torture of the criminally insane! Now if you look ahead you'll see our space program building &mdash; "

"Wait wait wait. *Space* program? Hell has a *space* program?" 

"Oh yes," the man nodded. "Why Hell is on the forefront of interplanetary travel. We're *this close* &mdash; " he held his thumb and index finger close together " &mdash; to visiting another galaxy. Wouldn't you believe it!"

"How is that possible?" I asked as the man led us past the space program building and down a different street.

"Oh, it's easy. Everyone who believes in evolution ends up here. We've had to make quite an adjustment since Darwin but now we're on the technological forefront of almost everything!"

"Ah," I said as the man led me to another building. 

"And this is our robotics lab. They develop people like me to do the mundane tasks, so that you residents can bask in the hellfire and watch basic cable all day long!" 

I pursed my lips. If Hell had everyone who believed in evolution, I wondered what Heaven would be like.

Score: 1064

"*No* crust?" the man grunted back. "You sure?"

"Yeah!" I was slightly drunk, and I found it amusing. At worst, I'd end up eating hot tomato sauce and cheese slop with a fork while watching cartoons. "And make it snappy! I'm hungry." I'd specifically picked the '30 minutes or less' place, though I'm really not too good at telling time when I'm inebriated. 

"You *sure* that's what you want?" 

I hiccuped and confirmed that yes, this is what I wanted. I was giggling, but the pizza place didn't find it as funny as I did.

"All right. Keep an eye out. We'll be dropping it off soon."

I headed back into the living room, which had a perfect view of the street nearby so I could see him coming. I put on Rick and Morty and settled in with another beer. It was anyone's guess as to whether I'd manage to stay awake in the half hour that it would take for them to bring my pie.

--------

I jerked awake at the knock on the door, spilling my beer. *Damn!* There was another knock in rapid succession, and I could see a black SUV waiting in my driveway with the lights on and the engine running. Right. Pizza guy. It all came back to me. I downed what was left of the beer, resolving the clean up the puddle later, and headed to the door. 

The pizza guy wasn't the normal acne-ridden scrawny high schooler. Instead, it was a grown man, maybe 25 or so. He wore all black except for a golden belt buckle and a thick gold chain around his neck that looked like it could have been used to safely secure a golden junkyard gate. All it needed was a padlock. And this guy certainly wasn't scrawny: he was built like a linebacker, probably over 250 lbs. He should be guarding a line outside a nightclub, not running pizzas over here at 2 AM. 

"I got your... pizza... right here," he said, holding up the thin box. There was a giant bulge in the middle of it, stretching the cardboard. And it certainly didn't *smell* like pizza at all. I took the box in my hand to open it up... and there was no pizza in it. Just a ziploc bag full of powdered sugar. 

"This isn't what I ordered, man." My words slurred a bit, and I had to lean against the doorway for support. "Remember? I wanted a pizza with no crust."

He glared at me, glanced around, and pushed the box lid closed again. "Are you fucking crazy?" he growled. "Don't open this out here!" He shoved me through the doorway and followed me inside. "This *is* what you ordered. A *pizza* with *no crust*." He made air quotes and nodded down at the box when he said it. 

I hiccuped again and looked back down at the box in my hands. "Whatever, dude." I was hungry enough to eat a bag of powdered sugar anyway. It didn't sound half bad: maybe I could make some pancakes, though that would risk burning my house down. Which is why I'd decided to order a pizza in the first place.

"So where's the cash?" he asked, filling up the doorway into my kitchen. 

"Oh, right." I reached into my back pocket and pulled out my wallet. I had to blink a few times to separate the ones and the fives from the twenty; everything was starting to blur together. *Shouldn't have had that last beer.* "Here you go!" I held out the $20 toward him; that should about cover it. 

He looked down at the bill, and let out a bark of laughter. Even his *laugh* was mean. I'd have to request the high school kid next time I ordered something from this place. I didn't like this delivery guy. "You've got to be kidding me," he said. From his waistband, he pulled out a pistol and casually waved it in my face.  

We both stared at each other for a moment; I had a bit of a hard time staying balanced. "Ugh, fine," I told him. I slapped another 2 dollars into his hand, even though the 20 should have been more than enough. "Here's a little extra for you. But next time, make sure it's a *real pizza* instead of sugar, man."

He scoffed. "Nice try, pal. That's gonna be $9,000. *This*," he waved the 20 in my face, "isn't quite gonna cut it."

I gave him a dumbfounded look then glanced down at my wallet. I didn't have that much money in there. Nor in my bank account. Nor would I have that much in *years* of saving.

"Well," I responded, pulling out my phone and showing him the time, "Good thing that you all have that 30-minutes-or-its-free guarantee, right?"

It was astonishing, really- until recently, man thought that no sound could permeate space.  But the needle like voices of the Floysians seemed to disregard the laws of physics, and their sheer volume cascaded down from miles above, where their small artificial a planet orbited.

At first, it had seemed like a great idea.  The aliens brought new technology, and resources, and production power unheard of in Earth.  They were a valuable asset and had come to the USA *first*.  

"We, the Floysians, have taken great interest in your country, specifically your constitution,". Said the Floysians leader as he shook hands with the president, "And we so admire it that after years of oppression from the other galactic civilizations, we wish to join your country, in a peace keeping manner, for the good of us both."

Of course the president had accepted.  He'd had no choice, reaching out to shake the leader's tentacle with a smile on his face, flinching at the screeching sound of the Floysian's voice.

"We reiterate our admiration for your first amendment- that of free speech.  Truly, it is a progressive notion, and one that has been withheld from Floysians for years."  

*Of course everyone should have a right to free speech,* the president had thought, *the other civilizations must be barbaric*

But that was before he *knew*.

The Floysians were prevented free speech not because of *what* they wanted to say, but rather *how much* they wanted to say.  The noise level from their planet rarely dipped below fifty decibels, and rose each day as new Floysians were born.  And unless America wanted to deny their new citizens free speech, they had no choice but to accept it.

Because the Floysians were never shutting up.

^(PM_ME_UR_PMS 12437 points 3 hours ago)  
A couple of years ago, in my home town of Pittsburgh, there was a murder that went unsolved despite what you'd think would be an easy case. It was pretty fucking brutal, actually- this guy, he beat the living shit out of a guy in his forties, smashed his head right in and left it there like ground beef. It was really, really gruesome- my friend was a cop and said it's the single worst thing he's ever seen. No one ever found out who did it, or why, really. But the guess is that it was some kind of drug deal gone south or someone mentally ill who just snapped. 

It's just really scary to think someone can do that and just wander the streets at night.

   >^(throwaway6392976 18526 points 46 minutes ago)  
Okay, I've heard enough of this shit for the past several years, now. I'm routing my IP through a proxy, but I don't even care how risky this is because I'm just tired. I'm tired of seeing people talk about me like I'm crazy, or deranged, or some kind of crazy asshole.

>Moreover, I'm sick of people talking about that fucking piece of shit like he was a victim, like he was just some poor guy that got caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time. His name was Dean Harroway, and I knew him, growing up. Wouldn't call him a friend, but we knew each other. This guy, this fucking prick, he used to joke with me like it was so funny...he'd bump into me sometimes, on my way home from work, so drunk he couldn't stand straight. He'd tell me about... how he was popular with the ladies. The...really young ladies. You see, he was a kindergarten teacher at the local elementary school. I tried to tell the police, but with no proof of anything they just brushed me off. Most people knew him and loved him, thought he couldn't do it.

>But one day, my daughter came home crying, shaking and detached from things she once loved. I'm not saying anything more than that.

>So I took a hammer to his head one night, when he was drunk, alone in his apartment. I smashed that fucker's brains right in, after smashing his kneecaps and fingers and feet to a pulp. And with every scream, I felt vindication. I felt justice for every little girl he'd made scream. 

>I left my family behind, knowing that at least they were safer this way. I traded my life, time with my baby girl, to protect those he harmed. Sure, sooner or later it would've surfaced and he would've gone down...but the law can be slow, sometimes. I wasn't going to let even one more girl get hurt just to do things the nice way.

>Some people don't get the nice way.

The lights on Ambassador Tel’s suspension tank remained static for some time.  Like the rest of his species, his- *it’s* - body was a tangled web of translucent strands like a jellyfish crossed with a ball of yarn.  

In their home waters, under that warm tropical sun, even a mild current had the strength to tear them in two.  This was of course by necessity, forming a crucial part of their reproductive cycle, but left them totally unfit for any sort of non-aquatic travel. 

So for one to undergo the invasive process of suspension, giving up months of their life to be cocooned in a steel tank filled with supportive, tear resistant gel had been my first clue to their desperation.  On a hunch, I had pressed the issue and asked the Ambassador how their recent conflict had been proceeding.

The indicator lights on the Ambassador’s tank stayed static for nearly fifteen minutes.  I was almost to the point of calling one of their aids to check the translation equipment when the lights began to flash and the Ambassador’s synthetic voice spoke.

“Ambassador Stewart, to put it simply, the war has been a catastrophic failure.”

I paused mid sip of my tea, then set the dish down. The directness surprised me, we were so often censored from extra solar affairs.

“Surely it’s not nearly as bad as that,” I responded, “You’re the largest of the local regional powers.  You had the clout to keep us unmolested since we were still building mud huts!”

The lights flashed, “No longer, our control has shrunk to less than one hundred cubic light years.  All that remains are the Home Waters, several extrasolar depots, and you.”

I felt alarm.  A feeling I had not had in a long time.

The lights flashed again, “Before you respond, let me ask you something.”

“Of course.”

“Why do you think we only sponsored your colony on Alpha, as opposed to just giving you the tensor shift mechanism out right?”

The tangent caught be by surprise.  I was still hung up on the thought of what type of enemy could conquer thousands of star systems in a few years time.

“When you contacted us, for the first time that is, you said it was imperative that we maintain our own path of technological development, that if we just borrowed, copied, or stole from others we would just blunt our own ability to innovate.”

The tanks lights lit up in a combination that indicated humor, “We lied.”

“Oh?”

“You’re brutal, short sighted, and violent and we wanted you controlled and suppressed so you didn’t burn across the galaxy like a cancer.”

“Oh,” was all that came out from between the surprise and shock.  

“We’ve watched you for thousands of years and never once have you come anywhere near what the civilized species of this spiral arm call peace.  Even now your General Adi in the South Pacific is butchering his people, and that’s only the most prolific instance of similar acts of brutality across your planet.  Even your most ‘civilized’ countries wage war every other decade!”

My diplomatic training roared back to the forefront of my mind, “Ambassador, these condemnations represent a serious shift in tone from our previous meetings.  While I respect that we have cultural differences-”

“It does not matter,” the Ambassador’s synthetic voice interrupted, ”I’m here to give you the tensor shift mechanism.”

Confused, and with the beginnings of anger at these shifts in the conversation, I coldly asked, “Why?”

A pause before the lights flashed again, “Because our war is about to become your war.  We ask this of you.  We offer the mechanisms partly because you will need it and partly in payment.”

“Payment for fighting your war?” I asked, real anger bubbling through.

“Payment for the right to beg your mercy when it’s all said and done.”

The man stood, teetering on the edge of the bridge. The wind whipped at his coat's lapels and flung his thinning hair around. Another strong gust would push him over, sending him hundreds of feet below into the icy depths of the Trenton River.

I sighed. Another day, another job.

***

Serendipity is the superhero name I chose for myself. Nobody else knows it. Why not? Well, I don't know about you, but I don't have the money or know-how to sew my own fucking superhero costume. I don't have super strength, or super speed, or the power of flight, or telekinesis. As such, I've gotta protect myself and my identity. 

It's not that I believe some supervillain is gonna get me - it's just that I don't want to have to deal with the feds. I would've named myself Anonymous, but I'd rather not associate myself with the dipshits on 4chan.

Anyway, I forgot to tell you what my power actually is. Silly me.

About two years ago, I was out on the school baseball diamond playing catch with my friend. I'd just gotten a new glove and had been dying to test it out. I threw the ball to her, punched my mitt a few times, and raised it to catch her return throw. 

Before the ball met my hand, I heard someone yell, "Rooter! This is comin' to you, bud!"

I whipped my head around, my body and arm turning with it, and a small, soft package landed in my mitt. Just before I could see who threw me the item, or what it even was, the baseball my friend threw thunked me in the head.

It knocked me out.

When I came to, my friend was shaking me urgently.

"Dude! Avery, dude!"

"...Fuck," I groaned, embarrassed that I'd taken my eye off the ball and paid the price for it.

"Dude, why the fuck did you bring that to school? Put it away!"

I looked up at her in confusion, and then down at my mitt, where she was looking. Inside it was a small bag filled with a fine white powder. Flour? 

I opened it up and put my finger in. It didn't feel like flour, and even though the thought was ridiculous, I immediately knew what it was.

"Is that... fucking cocaine?" I asked incredulously to no one in particular.

I stashed the bag in my pocket and tried to explain myself to my friend, but she wasn't having any of it. I lost a friend that day, but I gained something new.

Serendipity.

So yeah, there you have it. For some fucking reason, every time I raise my hand to catch something, somebody, somewhere, yells one of my nicknames and a drug or drink is thrown into my hand. Doesn't matter when or where, or how the law of physics would permit it. 

Quite frankly, I stopped caring a while ago. Unlimited free booze will do that to you.

***

"Just what I needed after a long day," I said to myself with fake enthusiasm. I massaged the bridge of my nose and inhaled deeply. "This fucker better be thankful."

I raised my hand, and right on cue, someone yelled, "Stick! Heads up!" With reflexes honed over the past two years, my fingers closed over yet another soft bag.

It was filled with pre-rolled joints.

"All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic," I half-sang to myself, quoting the Biggie Smalls tune. I flicked on my lighter and took a deep hit. Suicides were always tough.

The weed hit me quick and hard as I strolled over to the railing on the side of the bridge and swung my legs over. The man standing at the edge turned his head and saw me, surprise registering in his eyes.

"Who... who're you?" he asked. "You don't look like a cop."

"I'm not a cop," I replied, grinning. "Fuck the police."

My response must've startled him.

"Then... who are you?"

"I am the walrus," I replied, quoting Donnie from The Big Lebowski. The man continued to look confused. I chided myself for continuing my habit of quoting lines from my favorite songs and movies that most people didn't pick up on.

"Kidding. I'm just an average every day citizen of this fine town, and I was wondering why you're standing here," I said.

"Why do you think?" the man laughed, bitterly shaking his head. "I'm 54, I lost my job, my wife's cheating on me, and my son hates me. There's nothing left to live for."

"Shiiiiiiit," I said, half in response to his situation, half in response to the wave of high that rolled over my body. This was some good weed.

"Yeah, you can say that again," he muttered morosely.

"Shiiiiiit," I said. "Well, why not take a puff before your tragic demise?" I offered him the joint in my hand.

"I've never smoked weed before," he replied, cautiously eyeing it.

"You've also never killed yourself before. Right? First time for everything, man," I laughed, shrugging. I prayed to myself that this would work.

"Fair enough."

The man reached over and gingerly took the lit joint from my hand, sucking on it a bit and coughing.

"Do it softer than that, dude," I said. I couldn't help but chuckle.

The man tried again, this time getting a good lungful of smoke before he started to cough violently.

"Oh shit, nice hit." 

I took the joint from his hand and took another hit. Damn, this was good weed. The man kept on coughing as I tried to blow smoke rings in the blustering wind.

I leaned back against the railing, and my heart leapt as the man mirrored my actions. I hadn't looked down this whole time, but I didn't want to think about falling hundreds of feet to my death. I get free drugs whenever I want, but I wouldn't survive anything like that.

The man turned to me, his eyelids a little heavy, his eyes a little red. He had a goofy half-grin on.

"This makes me feel funny," he chortled.

"That's kinda the point, man," I said. "Anyway, tell me about this bitch of a wife you have."

"Well... Hey, what's your name?"

"Avery."

"Well, Avery, she's not really a bitch. She's just lonely, I guess. She tells me I work too much and-"

I interrupted him. "Being lonely isn't a justifiable reason to cheat, dude. Sorry. Continue."

The man seemed thoughtful for a moment, and forged on.

"Well, she said I worked too much, and that I wasn't filling her needs. So she had a fling with a younger guy from her work."

"Fuckin' bitches, man. Can't trust these hoes," I said, hoping he'd pick up on the slang I was using.

He laughed again.

"Yeah, I guess not," he said. "She was kind of annoying anyway. And she'd never give me a blowjob."

I guffawed, surprised at his last statement. I tried to stop and make some witty remark, but the weed took its hold on me, and soon I was laughing so hard tears were forming in my eyes. The man seemed like he couldn't help but laugh either, and soon we were both doubled over on the side of a bridge hundreds of feet above a churning, over-polluted river, sharing a joint and watching thousands of people pass us by without a second glance.

We continued on, just laughing, and pausing, and then bursting into laughter again until the sun began to dip below the horizon.

"Damn, that's really cool," the man said, watching the giant burning ball of gas's rays illuminate our atmosphere in hues of pink and purple.

"Yeah man," I said, taking another hit of the joint. **Damn**, this was some good weed.

"Hey Avery?" the man asked. I turned to him.

"Yeah?"

"I'm really hungry."

I smiled and reached over to smack his shoulder. "Let's go get something to eat, man."

FADE IN:

EXT. A TRIBAL MEETING GROUND - NIGHT

*Several figures huddle around a campfire. The flickering light reveals that half of the individuals are humans, whereas the other half are cat-like creatures. One of these latter beings rocks back and forth in place, staring at a silver box in front of him. This is HMRRH, a chieftain.*

**HMRRH:** Let me make sure that I understand this. When I speak, this... thing... listens to me, then allows you to understand me.

*One of the humans nods. This is BARTLET, a diplomat from Earth.*

**BARTLET:** That's correct. It also translates my words into your native tongue.    
**HMRRH:** Interesting. Thank you for clarifying.    
**BARTLET:** Are you interested in how it works?    
**HMRRH:** Not really, no.

*Bartlet looks slightly shocked by this.*

**BARTLET:** Are you sure? It's actually pretty fascinating.    
**HMRRH:** Yes, I'm sure it is. Maybe you can discuss it with our shaman later.    
**BARTLET:** "Shaman?"    
**HMRRH:** Apparently it can't translate everything.    
**BARTLET:** No, no, I know what a shaman is. I just don't understand why you'd want me to talk to one.    
**HMRRH:** Well, it's kind of her job. Anyway, I'm much more intrigued by stories from the other side.    
**BARTLET:** "Other side?"    

*Hmrrh points skyward.*

**HMRRH:** You know. Up there. Where the dead people go.    
**BARTLET:** Oh, gosh... this is awkward.    
**HMRRH:** What?    
**BARTLET:** We didn't come from any kind of "other side." We're from another world.    
**HMRRH:** Yes, I'm aware.    
**BARTLET:** Then what's all this about dead people?

*Hmrrh scrapes his teeth against themselves. The translator box emits a fair approximation of laughter.*

**HMRRH:** I didn't realize I'd be sharing such common knowledge with my creator!    
**BARTLET:** What?    
**HMRRH:** You see, every creature has a light within them, visible in their eyes. When their bodies cease to function, the light escapes and travels upward. Even now, you can see these sparks in the night sky.    
**BARTLET:** Sorry, what was that about "creator?"    
**HMRRH:** Everyone knows that creators often live amongst the dead. Some have argued that creators *are* the dead, and that they live in reverse from those on the ground.    
**BARTLET:** "In reverse?" I'm sorry, something must be wrong with this thing.

*Bartlet lightly kicks the translator box.*

**HMRRH:** Consider: A person is born, and their light begins to glow when they first open their eyes. When they die and their light departs, it is no longer bound by the rules of this world. It may exist at all places and times at once, even before it came to be.    
**BARTLET:** That's... actually a fairly advanced concept in physics.    
**HMRRH:** I'll take your word for that. To continue, though: Since a creator can see their work before it is complete, they are therefore able to devise its creation. We call this "inspiration." Those who would be creators often function best when they can see the lights of those who are above them.    
**BARTLET:** I have to confess, that makes sense in a weird way.    
**HMRRH:** So, it's correct, then? You come from the land of the dead?

*A moment of awkward silence passes, during which time Bartlet looks uncomfortable.*

**BARTLET:** Okay, look, I'm just going to be blunt: Those lights up there are stars. They're not dead people. My friends and I came from a planet that orbits one of those stars.    
**HMRRH:** Which one?    
**BARTLET:** It's not visible at the moment.    
**HMRRH:** I see. Or rather, I don't. 

*Hmrrh scrapes his teeth together.*

**HMRRH:** (*CONT'D*) Go on.    
**BARTLET:** Right. Well. There are more stars than anyone could ever hope to count, and many of them have planets around them. It's difficult to get from one planet to another, though, because the distance between them is enormous.    
**HMRRH:** I'm not hearing anything that refutes what I've told you.    
**BARTLET:** What?    
**HMRRH:** You came a great distance from a spark of light in the sky. As I have already told you, the sparks need not conform to the rules that governed them in life. Furthermore, you say that there are more of these sparks than can be counted, just as there are more people than can be numbered.    
**BARTLET:** That's not...    
**HMRRH:** (*Interrupting*) Besides, now that we know creators can retake physical forms after death, well... one can only imagine how much life must be out there.    
**BARTLET:** There's that "creator" word again. You do know that I'm just like you, right?

*Once again, Hmrrh scrapes his teeth together.*

**HMRRH:** Yes, I'm well aware. Again, though, consider: Your life was given to you by a spark in the sky, was it not?    
**BARTLET:** In a way, yes, but...    
**HMRRH:** (*Interrupting*) And that spark has doubtlessly existed for far longer than your... planet, was it?    
**BARTLET:** Yes.    
**HMRRH:** So, the spark was once a life - perhaps one not even born yet - which gave rise to more lives. They, in turn, became light again, then once more became life. This is a power reserved for those who can create. Thus, you are a creator.

*Understanding finally dawns on Bartlet's face.*

**BARTLET:** Oh! Oh, I think I see. You're not saying I'm *your* creator; just *a* creator.    
**HMRRH:** No, no, you are my creator.    
**BARTLET:** What?

*Hmrrh places a clawed hand on Bartlet's wrist.*

**HMRRH:** I have claimed you as my own. Worry not, though: I have no plans to keep you here.    
**BARTLET:** I'm so confused.    
**HMRRH:** This much is evident. Please, have some rest. No doubt our shaman will wish to discuss your magic with you tomorrow.

*Hmrrh stands and leaves a bewildered-looking Bartlet near the fire. He walks away from the lit area, and encounters a second member of his species. This is SCISSHS.*

**SCISSHS:** That was painful to overhear.    
**HMRRH:** Be patient with them. As you know, creators are often too enchanted with their own works to know the ways of the world.    
**SCISSHS:** That's one explanation.    
**HMRRH:** Have you another?    
**SCISSHS:** Isn't it obvious?

*Scisshs looks over at the firelight, watching as Bartlet awkwardly shares food with the others. He spills some on himself and flaps his arms with a comical motion.*

**SCISSHS:** (*CONT'D*) Gods are just stupid.

FADE OUT.

The body of this contender remained still, unmoving. Usually, when the undead were killed, their ashes would fade, and they would be reborn nearby, ready for another attempt to defeat me. Yet this Champion remained still. In the sky, the sun had faded to almost nothing, its fire nearly gone. 
Shifting the halberd in my hand, I stepped forward, pushing aside the great doors that I had guarded for so long. I made my way up the path, entering the dark shrine with purpose.

"All right," Dean thought, putting the helmet on. "I hope this works."

By his side, the stray dog tried unsuccessfully to remove his own helmet.

Dean pressed the 'Converge Conscience' button and closed his eyes. He felt a jolt of electricity going through his 
body, and then everything went dark.

Then Dean opened his eyes, and suddenly he was watching the room from very different point of view. He was watching everything from four feet off the ground.

"Yes!" Dean thought, amazed that the incredibly fishy-sounding device he bought off of a Craiglist's announcer by the username 'Dude-with-cool-stuff' had worked. "Yes, it worked!"

"Dude, what's going on?" a voice sounded in his head.

*Huh… that's weird.*

Dean lifted the dog's front paw and pulled the helmet off of his newly acquired canine head. He barked once, just for the fuck of it.

"Hey! I didn't bark! Who barked?"

That voice again…

"Wait, what's going on?" Dean asked himself internally.

"Dude, what the hell?" the voice answered.

"Who are you?"

"I'm Barkie. Or… I don't know. That was the name they gave me at the pound, before I escaped. Who the hell are 
you?"

"Oh shit," Dean thought. "You're the dog?"

"Yeah, I'm the God-damned dog. Who are you!?"

"I'm the guy who bought a device from a crazy scientist to transfer my conscience into a dog's head," Dean 
thought-replied.

"Oh. Okay. I don't understand anything you just said, but can we go out and find some food?" Barkie replied. "I'm hungry. I'm usually hungry. Like, all the time. It's weird, right? I wonder if other dogs are always hungry too. You know where we can find food? Should we look for some trashcans we can turn over? What do you think?"

*Shit… this is going to be hard.*

&nbsp;

Dean walked himself out of the house and looked around the street. He started for Beverly Hills, where Ed now lived.

"Hey, human dude, where are we going?"

"Shut up, stupid dog."

"Is there food where we are going? I'm kinda hungry. Have I said that already? I feel like I said that already. Don't get me wrong, it's just that I don't usually have anyone to talk to. I mean, I bark to other dogs, but that's pretty much it."

Dean ignored the dog. Okay, this wasn't part of the plan. The dog being able to communicate with him was 
definitely not something he expected. Still. He was going to go through with it. The plan remained the same.

He was going to find Ed and kill the shit out of him for what he had done to him back at the Warehouse. Then he 
was going to find Murphy and Tracy and all the others and do the same to them. Talking dog or no talking dog.

"Dude, are you thinking about killing people?" Barkie's voice sounded in his head. "That's not cool, dude. I don't wanna kill people."

"Shut up. Let's just keep walking."

They would pay. All of them. And Dean would get away clean, because, well, who on Earth would believe that a 
man transferred his mind to a dog so he could kill his ex-partners in crime and not go to jail? That sounded like 
something out of that weird Writing Prompts forum Dean visited sometimes.

Dean reached Ed's house just as Ed was stepping away and heading for his car. A God-damned Lamborghini. That 
bastard had double-crossed Dean and taken all the money for himself, and now he was driving a Lambo! The asshole!

"All right… steady now, Barkie…"

"Dude, seriously, don't bite the guy to death. That's so not cool. Let's just find some beef jerky. I love beef jerky. They have it at the trashcan behind the Seven Eleven near --"

"Shut up. I get to control the body, not you."

"Come on, man, he seems like a nice guy. I don't wanna kill humans. Humans are awesome. They play fetch with 
you and they give you food and –"

"Shut up!"

Ed was almost by his car. Dean took a deep breath, pulled back and charged for –

**"Cat! Cat! Cat!"**

"What?" Dean thought-exclaimed. "What are you talking abou –"

But Dean was no longer in control. Against his will, the dog's body charged in the opposite direction, heading for 
what appeared to be a Siamese cat by the neighbor's mailbox.

The cat spotted Dean and, in a quick movement, turned back and made a run for it.

"We'll get him, man, we'll get him!" Barkie yelled, as they doubled their speed.

"Stop, you idiot! I don't wanna get the cat!"

"But we must get him! He's the cat! We must get the ca – aaw, shoot, he climbed over the roof. How do cats 
climb so high?"

Dean sighed internally. He noticed he was panting hard. The cat disappeared over the edge of the roof. Dean turned back. Ed was inside his Lamborghini already, and a second later, took off down the suburban road.

"God damn it," Dean thought to himself. 

"How do they do it? It's amazing," Barkie thought. "I can't climb the freaking stairs without fearing for my life and 
these cat dudes are all over the place jumping everywhere." He paused. "I guess that's why they get all the 
Youtube attention. Damn, I wish I was a Youtube star. Those guys have it easy."

"God damn it, you stupid dog, you let Ed get away!" Dean thought-yelled. "Because of a stupid cat!"

"Yeah! Cats are stupid!" Barkie agreed, excitedly. "Come on, let's go around the house and get him!"

"No, that's not what I – God damn it, is this thing malfunctioning? Why are you in control now? Stop it, I don't 
want to chase a cat, I don't –"

But they were halfway around the house already, and Barkie was thinking "Catcatcatcatwhereisthecatcatcat" on 
repeat.

"I hate my life," Dean thought, bitterly.

**"CatcatacatCAT! FOUND THE CAT! I FOUND THE CAT DUDE, LET'S GO!"**

And off they went again.

#### [WP] A "popular" girl falls in love with a "nerdy" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him

Score: 865

"For the last time Samantha, cut it out! This is getting so weird!"

The girl withdrew her hand from the boy's arm, hurt flooding her eyes even as she brushed her dark hair away from her now bright blue, speckled skin and then huffed with frustration.

"Sam, come on. No one has been into Avatar since like, 2011. And how long did you spend on that weird blue alien costume anyways?"

"Na'vi." The girl corrected him mechanically, reflexively.

"Okay, Na'vi -- whatever. Either way, showing up at my place in these outfits... it's got to stop. Weren't you dating... what's his name, Brad? Kyle?"

"Derek, his name was Derek. We're not together anymore." Sam's voice was soft and quiet as she supplied the name, her gaze downcast at her feet.

"Look, Sam, we used to be kind of friends. I mean, we didn't hang out and you share NO interests with me, but it was fine having you around the gang. Can't we just go back to that? Showing up in dirty storm trooper outfits isn't--"

"Sand trooper." Again, the correction was automatic; mechanical and fast.

"Right, right. Sand troopers. Those are the ones from.. uh..." Mark paused, his brain blanking on which Star Wars the trooper variant had first appeared in.

"A New Hope."

Sam supplied to answer so easily and smoothly that it caused Mark to pause, and he looked back at her blue, artfully done face with suspicion and a sudden spark of insight.

"Released?" He queried.

"1977."

"Produced by?"

"Gary Kutz, but Rick McCallum did the special edition."

"What was the character name for the opera singer in Fifth Element?"

"Diva Plavalaguna."

"In what movie are ancient mythologies the result of alien interference in early human history?"

There's a momentary pause now by Sam, but the lapse is fleeting before her eyes flash with challenge and she angles her chin at the boy standing in front of her defiantly.

"Stargate, 1994, directed by Roland Emm--"

"WOW Sam! You're a total NERD!"

Mark dissolved into a fit of wild laughter, and if her face hadn't been covered in paint he would have seen the furious blush that bloomed over Sam's pretty features. She shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as he regained his composure, leaning against the doorframe of his front door, wiping tears of humor from his eyes.

"Have you been HIDING that all these years?"

Sam's mouth worked silently for a moment, trying to drudge up words stuck in her throat before she finally pushed them out past her lips.

"YES! Okay?! Are you happy? I-I like you so much because you like all the things I like! But my parents always said that Star Wars and Alien and Iron Man were things meant for boys, not pretty little girls in dresses. And then, well, then I was in cheerleading and they would have made fun of me! But when we graduated that all stopped mattering and I-I-I---!"

She was near tears herself now, but not the same mirthful kind Mark had shed. Seeing this his features dropped into guilt and he pushed away from the door frame, tentatively laying a hand on her arm.

"Okay! Okay, I get it Sam. Come on; lets watch a movie or something. You're going to have to sit on a towel though, I don't want that blue stuff all over my couch."

"Thanks Mark. Really, thanks."

"Don't mention it, Sam. Like really, don't mention it. You're totally going to mess up my street cred with the gang."

She was giggling now as he gently directed her past him, into the apartment and the closed the door with a muffled click.

#### [WP] - You are an angel of heaven. Angels are tasked with creating animals to populate the earth. You are called into God's office to discuss your finished project - the platypus.

Score: 863

Kabshiel waited in the hall to be ushered into the Presence.  He was worried; this would be the first time being unexpectedly summoned, and he wondered what he might have done to warrant this attention from the LORD.  Rapt in thought, and concerned that his actions might somehow be counter to the praise the LORD may want, he didn't notice Adnoai until the archangel was nearly upon him.

"He is ready to address you, Kabshiel," the mighty prince of Heaven said to him.

"Is it bad?  Please brother, tell me.  I only wish to know how I might have offended our Father."

"The Mind of our Father is not known to me in this matter brother.  I'd hedge on the idea that you are well and truly fucked though."

With a heavy sigh, Kabshiel straightened up, adjusted his robes, and set forward to prostrate himself before the Throne of Heaven, and receive the guidance and orders of the LORD.  Standing before the magnificence of the Presence alone for the first time in his long existence alone, he trembled before the might of His being, the attention of the Lord of Creation turned and focused solely upon his form.  The power was overwhelming, and was nearly crushed by the force of that great Will.

Prostrate, Kabshiel said, "Oh God, My God, Father of All, Lord of the Heavens and Earth, Creator of Creation itself, I am humbled before your presence and have prost-"

"GET UP.  THIS IS AN OFFICIAL VISIT, BUT WE CAN DISPENSE WITH THE FORMALITIES.  ONCE AGAIN, MY BELOVED SON, YOU'VE CAUGHT MY ATTENTION."  Unnerved by the interruption and breaking of protocol, Kabshiel slowly, cautiously stood up and risked to look upon the Presence.

"Father, hae I displeased you?"

"KABSHIEL, YOU'VE BEEN DOING WORK ON THE GREAT SOUTHERN ISLAND UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT OF SANDALPHON.  YOU IMMEDIATELY SHOWED CLEVERNESS WITH YOUR WONDERFUL CREATION OF THE WALLABY.  IT IS A BEAUTIFUL AND CLEVER CREATURE, AND WAS SO ADMIRED THAT SANDALPHON IMMEDIATELY TASKED NAYA'IL WITH TESTING A LARGER VERSION WITH THE KANGAROO.  THIS PLEASED ME, AS I AM SURE YOU REMEMBER FROM THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE BROUGHT TO MY PRESENCE."

"Yes, of Father of Wisdom."

"OH SHIT, JUST CALL ME BY MY NAME.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TIRING THESE NEW TITLES YOU LOT KEEP COMING UP WITH CAN BE."

"Of course-"

"ANYWAY, YOU AGAIN SHOWED THAT YOU HAVE HIDDEN BEAUTY IN YOU WITH YOUR NEXT OVERSEEN CREATION, THE CASSOWARY.  IT HAS VIBRANT COLORING IN ITS FACE, AND IS BOTH MAJESTIC IN ITS PRESENCE, WHILE DARINGLY MADE AS A FLIGHTLESS BIRD.  THOSE AREN'T VERY COMMON, YOU KNOW, AND MAY TEND OT BE PRETTY SPECTACULAR FAILURES.  THE FACT THAT IT STANDS UP WITH THE OSTRICH WHILE NOT BEING AS STUPIDLY RIDICULOUS AS THE EMU SAYS A LOT ABOUT YOUR TALENT.  LOVE THE EMU THOUGH; IT'S SO STUPID."

"Thank you, My Lord-"

"THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO USE MY NAME.  ANYWAY, I NEARLY HAD IT IN MIND TO HAVE YOU WORK HAND IN HAND WITH RAPHAEL, YOUR CREATIONS WERE SO PLEASING.  HE'S BEEN DOING WONDERFUL THINGS WITH INSECTS, BUTTERFLIES PARTICULARLY.  SO, I ORDERED SANDALPHON TO LET YOU TRY YOUR HAND AT YOUR FIRST UNGUIDED CREATION."

"Yes, and thank you for the chance to let me prove mysel-"

"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU MAKE HERE?  WHAT IS THIS?"  Upon this divine utterance, a small, furry form plopped into existence in front of the Divine being, at the foot of the Throne of Heaven, in the Temple of the Lord, at the middle of Heaven, in the Center of Creation.

"Well, I haven't come up with a final name yet, but I'm leaning towards 'Platypus'."

"HAD YOU PARTAKEN OF ASMODEI'S MUSHROOMS BEFORE PUTTING YOUR WILL TO WORK?  THIS THING FOLLOWS NO RULES WHATSOEVER.  YOU'VE MADE A FURRY, FLIGHTLESS BIRD THING THAT IS ELECTROSENSITIVE.  AND POISONOUS.  AND UNBELIEVABLY AGGRESSIVE.  IS IT EVEN A BIRD?  IT LAYS EGGS.  I HAVE WISDOM BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION, MY CHILD, BUT EVEN I CANNOT FATHOM WHY YOU WOULD JUST SLAP THIS FUCKING THING TOGETHER LIKE YOU DID.  PLEASE, ENLIGHTEN ME."

Dumbfounded, Kabshiel opened and closed his mouth a few times, reminiscent of a dying fish, before mustering enough self-awareness to say, "Well, Lahiel had been doing wonderful things with monitor lizards, and he even made a tank of a beast with a nose protrusion made of fingernails!  I had hoped to please you with my imagination,-"

"IT'S FUCKING WEIRD.  IT DOESN'T MATCH THE THEME OF YOUR ASSIGNED LOCALE.  THINGS HERE ARE DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL, NOT JUST UNUSUAL.  YOU NAILED THE SECOND EDICT SPOT ON, BUT SERIOUSLY."

"I had seen so many violent creatures on the Southern island.  So many things with lethality hidden under their beauty and majesty.  I had only hoped to provide a creature with mercy in its being, devoid of the seeming cut-throat malice so prevalent in the fauna there.  Heck, even a lot of the flora wants to kill everything around it.  The poison was to give it a means of defending itself and thriving as a testament to the wonder of Your grace, that even in a landscape so harsh, peace can be found in a creature such as this."

"WHY IS IT SO WILDLY AGGRESSIVE THEN?"

"Sandalphon insisted upon it, Lord.  She said it had to be, to meet the requirements You had laid down for her."

The Lord's demeanor softened from displeasure into compassion for His child.  "I SEE NOW, MY CHILD.  YOU HAVE TRULY SHOWN INSIGHT INTO MY PLAN.  GET RID OF THE WILD AGGRESSION; IT LOOKS FAR TO SILLY TO BE A MURDER MACHINE LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW.  SOFTEN UP THE FUR, AND MAKE IT PERSONABLE AND FRIENDLY TO MY CHERISHED CREATION MAN, AND YOU CAN KEEP IT."

With joy radiating from his very being, Kabshiel exclaimed, "Oh thank you Lord!  I had hoped you would be pleased!"

"OK, OK, CALM DOWN.  AND MAKE ME ANOTHER CUTE THING FOR THERE.  THE PLACE SORELY NEEDS IT."

"I think I know just the thing, Father!  I've been playing around with an idea that might fit the bill.  I'm hesitantly coining it the Koala..."

I bowed my head and looked at my hands. I fiddled with my fingers. I heard my companion lean back in her chair. 

"That is an... interesting request."

I looked back up. She had one leg crossed over the other, one arm draped over the back of the chair. The thumb on her hand not clutching the chair was between her teeth. 

Considering what I'd just asked her to do, she was hideously casual. She looked like she was mulling over what she wanted for dinner.

"I'll talk to my superiors."




Every one of our councilmen had gathered, plus one human. We watched out windows and on displays as our enemies approached, their ships painted with bright streaks and images of death. We blanched. Our human companion sipped her drink. A tiny smirk crossed her face.

"They have no idea what they've done."

Our city was perfectly still, pale buildings reaching upwards higher than any human building. It looked dead already. We looked beaten. They didn't stop.

"Open fire."

The order was icy cold. Everything they did was cool and calculated and cunning.

*crack*

The first tremendous slug from their ships came from above. It slammed into the flagship at over 60,000 kilometres per hour. She collapsed inwards, towards the hole torn through her hull. And then she fell, slow and burning, from the sky. I heard later she landed in a shallow lake in the middle of a public park.

We heard the sound of the slug hitting our pavements, followed by the flagship hitting the ground.

*crack, crack, crack*

The slugs no longer made individual noises. So many were fired at once, it was like a hailstorm.

Ships fell. The few troops who landed alive were torn apart by humans who willingly threw themselves from their ships with nothing but a small propulsion jet to slow their descent. The fleet our enemies had sent was destroyed utterly in less than 40 seconds.

The human in the chamber sipped her drink again.

"That's it? I guess we got them by surprise." Everyone else was silent.


World after world fell, and we reclaimed them. The humans had no interest in taking our cities for themselves. They slaughtered the enemy, gave the all-clear, and left. Every time, without fail. They took back all our worlds, but by that point, it wasn't just pest control anymore. It was *their* war now. They pushed to worlds that weren't ours or anyone else's to reclaim. They expanded their territory right around ours. What had once been a defence force was now a full-blown invasion. They chased and chased. Cold and calculated. Circling, striking, taking what they wanted and destroying everything else. The homeworld was nearly reached before we'd even begun to recover.


"Call them back." His huge eyes bulged out of his bowed head as he kneeled before us. "Call the humans back. You've taken what's yours." The council talked among themselves.

"The humans... are acting of their own accord. There is nothing we can do for you."

*"We have made a terrible mistake."*

"I didn't mean anything by it!"

The human screwed up his face. "What's that?"

"I... I didn't mean anything!"

He tilted his head to one side. Oh my Simulator! Was that a sign of aggression?

"I didn't mean anything!"

"Anything... by what?" he asked. "I only asked what you were looking at. Was it the TV? This is my favourite show," he said. "Have you seen it?"

I stepped back. "I didn't see anything!" I said.

"Dude," the human said.

What was a dude? Would it come and claim my foetuses? They were gestating in my sac. How could I protect them? I'd only just accepted them from their mother. How could she forgive me?

He pointed at the screen. "The show. Have you seen it? It's great. It's about a cop. He plays by his own rules, but he gets the job done. You know?"

"By his..." I stuttered, "... *own* rules? Not the rules of the Law?"

He nodded, sipping a filthy brown liquid from an open container. "His *own* rules. Look at this bit. Best episode ever."

I turned my attention to the screen in deference to him. Perhaps this show of obsequious powerlessness would quell the raging fires of violence within him. Lit up by the primitive lights, I saw a human strike - strike! - another human in the face and demand to know where a missing child was. The victim of this crime asserted that he knew not where the missing child was; yet the first human struck him again. Again!

I turned away.

"The vehicle," I said. "When..." I cleared one of my throats. "When will it be ready?"

The human stepped towards me. I tried, how I tried! I tried not to flinch. The Discussion Warriors of Planthentintrix would have been proud of me. I belonged on the Stern Debating Battlefield of Fharginord alongside them - and if my salient argument should fail to stand up to cross-examination? Then to rest in the Eternal Fields of the Fallen.

"Give it an hour," the human said. "It's only a blown flange. We'll have it taped back up. It'll get you to Alpha Centuraui."

I laughed with relief. "An hour?" I asked, incredulous.

"Sure," he said. "If that. Oh, look! Look! Watch this bit. It's great."

The human on the screen raised a weapon to his victim's knee-joint. He demanded to know where the hostage was again. I gripped my abdomen in fearful anticipation. My foetuses quivered beneath. The victim, excreting droplets of effluent in fear, somehow explained where the missing child was.

"How did he come by this information?" I asked.

The human looked up at the screen. "What?" he asked. "Dude, he knew all along. He was the guy that took him."

Such deceit! Such wickedness! Packaged as entertainment and presented as enjoyment! Such...

The human on the screen hit the child-taker with the butt of his weapon. At this point, I kind of felt like he deserved it. 

"What will he do now?" I asked.

The human looked at me, the corners of his mandible-less feeding hole turning upwards. "He's going to get the kid back," he said.

"Playing by the rules?" I asked, my voice tremulous.

"What?" he asked. "No, man. Of course not."

I relaxed, confused, and docile. "Dude," I said. "That's awesome."

"It's a Tuesdayyy!" Sang LuciLeo before work to LumiLeo, "You know what that means? My night with the wife! And it's gonna get *kinky*."

They were in their apartment, a one bedroom on the seedier side of town where their chance of meeting a friend was nonexistent. LuciLeo smoked a cigar on the couch with one hand, a handle of jack in the other, while LumiLeo sipped red wine and flipped a page of his book. 

"You know," said LumiLeo, "I think she enjoys the sweet loving more. You're just jealous your methods can't compare."

"And you're just jealous today is my day for bangin, and your day for workin." Retorted LuciLeo. 

He was right, of course. According to their calendar, which LumiLeo had made since he was the more trustworthy of the two, even to LuciLeo, LumiLeo had work duty. That meant while LuciLeo had the day off, LumiLeo would step into the office and do what he did best- inspire his coworkers, compliment his boss, and complete his deliverables. Tomorrow, LuciLeo would return and put the fear of God back into his underlings, take the boss out for strippers and booze, and fudge some numbers. It was the ultimate combination, the perfect good cop / bad cop. 

And since the incident, only six months before, they'd been promoted twice. Adding that to LuciLeo's drug dealing, their salary had quadrupled. 

But that wasn't the only place their life has improved. 

Their sex life was off the charts, the wife never knowing what to expect. LuciLeo learned to shred on the guitar, and his band had already been headlining at a few of the seedier clubs. LumiLeo estimated he was halfway to enlightenment. 

And now it seemed strange to both of them, that when they were combined, they had always thought the other held them back.

Score: 777

"Okay, let me have it."

Not quite what I would have expected coming out a kid. Sitting in the hospital bed, kid looks like ET. The picture they used when they proposed this whole idea...it was a lot more flattering. His head didn't look so...big.

"Cadeceus?"

The woman to my right, dark haired a nice rack that made her reporters badge just sway in ehen she turned. Oh right, the reporters. My publicist said it would be great publicity once I told her about my powers. I'm a healer, pretty damn valuable honestly, like a unicorn. But only if I punch someone. And not halfheartedly, I've got to punch them **really** hard like I hate them. When I told her the specifics she went white as a sheet. She jumped the gun; organized an healing event. 

Cancer ward at the local children's hospital. I was legally obligated to punch the cancer our of these children. Now all these people were waiting for me to go Muhammed Ali on a bunch of terminal children. As I looked at the kid, Ethan (?) was his name. Big old coke bottle glasses, staring up at me like a puppy. 

A poor terminally ill puppy, kept on staring at my namesake, the red caduceus symbol on my chest. Or maybe just my chest.

"Kid," I say with a forced smile, "this is going to hurt me a lot more than you."

The first blow knocked him out of the bed. That got some instinctual gasps out of the crowd, given they could hear the air snap. I got on top of him as soon as I could and landed another one square in the nose. It was always jarring putting all my force into the punch only to see nothing happening.

He started flailing a bit with the next few, so I--holy crap! The little turd actually tried to cop a feel! "Now you're going to get it." I growled.

It stopped being coordinated. I just wailed on him as hard as I could. Started hitting him faster and faster as the color started coming to his face for the first time in years, the hair that started coming for the first time, the soft cries being replaced by giggling. Now that? That just made me angrier.

But I'm no athlete honestly. I tired out in maybe a few minutes. Looking at him on the floor...the picture of health. Doctors actually clapping, the reporters cameras flashing. Some actually congratulating the kid, who was looking at me with a smile on his face.

I'm going to have to invest in a sandbag.

Score: 774

"Remember the plan this time, Han," Chewie growled as they rode the elevator up to the Death Star detention center. "We don't need another repeat of what happened on Seregar. They're going to call in about my transfer, so you need to use the communications jammer, right? Remaining undetected is the most important thing."

Han, standing to the right in full stormtrooper getup, nodded. Luke standing on the left side had no idea what Chewie was saying, but he didn't need to: Han had already explained the plan. At least, Chewie *hoped* he had. Even when he was willing to translate, it seemed like orders somehow got garbled. Chewie couldn't speak Basic so he wasn't sure if Han was translating correctly, but part of him was beginning to think that Han wasn't as fluent in Shyriiwook as he claimed to be.

The doors swished open, and Chewbacca entered the detention bay flanked by the two 'stormtroopers.' He clasped his hands together, pretending they were cuffed. 

"Woftushpo ofp hufutrumnes?" the human officer asked, eyes darting between Chewbacca and Han. 

*Play it cool, Han,* Chewbacca thought. The imperials would be suspicious if he spoke to a Stormtrooper, so he had to stay silent for now. And he had to rely on Han's improvisational skills, which was always a perilous gamble.

"Fulterhesto hogjowbiga moahwe tha ame no pa," Han replied, nodding toward Chewie. The imperial officer's eyes narrowed, and Chewie's heart skipped a beat. Something was wrong. The human suddenly gestured to the guards behind him, who ran forward with weapons drawn. Then he reached for the communicator. *Damn it!*

"Use the jammer, Han!" Chewie roared, knocking away the guard that came close. Gunfire richocheted around the room as both groups opened fire. Luke tossed Chewie a weapon, and he quickly dispatched one of the black-helmeted prison guards. "We need the officer alive though in case someone comes to investigate!"

Right as Chewie finished his sentence, Han shot the imperial officer in the chest, and he crumpled into a heap over the console. "IDIOT!" Chewbacca berated Han. "At least shoot out the cameras, then!" He aimed his own weapons at the various sensors around the room. That should buy *some* time. 

Finally the room was silent. Han rushed over to the beeping console and managed to silence it... but then began speaking into it.

"What the hell are you doing?" Chewie whispered, not wanting to be heard by whoever was on the other end. Han didn't listen, though. He kept babbling in Basic nonsense, until finally he got frustrated and shot out the communicator. *Oh, great,* Chewie thought. *That's certainly not suspicious or anything*. From the look on Han's face, Chewie guessed that they'd have company in a minute or two. 

They rushed back to the detention block and opened up the cell, revealing a female human in white robes. They all jabbered together for a while while Chewie kept a lookout. And just as he suspected, it was only a matter of time before red lights flashed: the lock was being overridden. "Put on your damn helmet, you fool!" he shouted to Han. Both he *and* the kid had removed theirs, and at the *worst* possible time. What is *wrong* with these people?

Together, they backed into the tunnel and kept firing, searching for some escape. There would be no stemming this flood of storm troopers; there must have been *millions* on the Death Star, and it was only a matter of time before one was smart enough to bring up heavy weaponry. 

"Guys, there's an access panel to a maintenance tunnel over there," Chewie shouted over the din of the battle. He pointed further down the tunnel where he'd spotted the hatch. It wouldn't be hard to remove. But it was like Han didn't even hear him. He was too busy chattering with the other humans. "Damn it, Han! Listen!" 

The female human shot a hole through some type of grate, then dove in. "Han, why didn't you tell her about the damn access panel???" Chewie roared to his companion.

Han just shouted something back in basic and gestured toward the trash chute. It was too late for Chewie's suggestion now, anyway: the stupid human acted without waiting to hear if anyone else had any suggestions. Chewie didn't know a thing about her yet, but she seemed like the perfect match for stupid headstrong Han. "God damn it," Chewie growled to himself as he followed the princess down the trash chute. For the thousandth time, he swore that he was ready to give up on this life debt and return to Kashyyyk instead of constantly risking his life with this human numbskull again.

#### [WP] You have the ability to reverse time by 6 hours whenever you're about to die. You're currently on a 10 hour flight on a plane that's about to crash.

Score: 766

I had six hours, again. Whenever I was about to die I got a chance to turn everything back and correct the mistakes I had made. I got put six hours into the past, and I could re-try. 

Of course, sitting in seat 17C wasn't going to help me. At the point I was forced back to I'd already been sitting here for four hours. I was on this plane at the start of my six hours. 

I'd just finished learning that no third of the plane was safe, and that i couldn't get into the cockpit to do anything. None of that was going to solve my problems. I had to think of something else. 

I put my headphones in before the baby behind me started crying this time.

The last time I'd had to use my power was when my parents had picked me up from the airport and we were driving back. Someone had run a red light and destroyed the side of the car that I was on. Solving that problem had been easy, I'd just made sure that I asked for food on the way home. I'd just gotten back from University so my parents were willing to spoil me.

The time before that had been getting my friends to call a cab. I'd just offered to pay.

Before that I really shouldn't have tried to drive that fast.

I die in cars a lot.

Either way, at this point I was sitting in a plane and there wasn't an obvious solution. Six hours was a lot of time, but time wasn't the issue, it was the fact that I couldn't really leave the plane. Telling them that I was sick wasn't about to get an emergency landing, I'd asked, and they weren't stopping for any good reason.

If I got into the cockpit I could at least try to land the damn thing. Asking didn't work, so I figured I was going to need to force my way in. I grabbed the pen that I'd taken with me onto the plane, and stood up.

Someone grabbed me before I could make it anywhere close to the cockpit, an arm around my neck and forcing me down. People clapped, and I was restrained in the back. All that attempt got me was four hours without music before I died.

17C, turn on the music before the baby cries. Don't get restrained. The seat doesn't change anything. 

17C, turn on the music before the baby cries. Don't get restrained. You don't know enough about the inner workings of an airplane to change anything from the bathroom. The seat doesn't change anything.

17C, turn on the music before the baby cries. Don't get restrained. You don't know enough about the inner workings of an airplane to cause problems from the bathroom. The seat doesn't change anything. The hostess' name is Tamara, she's nice. Her Dad works pretty close to yours. No, she won't give you her number.

17C, turn on the music before the baby cries. Don't get restrained. You don't know enough about the inner workings of an airplane to cause problems from the bathroom. The seat doesn't change anything. None of the people around you have anything useful in their bags. The person in seat 38A is sympathetic, but just thinks you're crazy. The man in seat 23B won't take out his headphones. Tamara doesn't care about the plane crashing but didn't think it was a funny joke. The terrorist thing doesn't work even once the restraining man goes to the washroom, Tamara has one hell of a chokehold.  The hostess' name is Tamara, she's nice. Her Dad works pretty close to yours. No, she won't give you her number. If you're drunk enough, you're pretty sure you can feel the first second of dying. You need to get off this plane.

"Excuse me," I said to the woman of 14C. She took out her headphones. "Can I switch seats with you?" I asked.

She looked down at her leg room. She was in the exit row which meant that she had extra. She shook her head.

"Look I-" I stopped myself before I tried anything weird. "My legs really hurt and I need to stretch them out, I can do a hundred bucks to trade seats with you-"

"I'll do it," the man beside her said before she could speak.

"I want the window seat," I corrected as he started to get up. He looked at her. She looked at me. She shrugged. I pulled out my money.

We traded seats and I enjoyed the extra leg room. I wasn't here for the comfort, I was there for the fucking door. Some fresh air. Something before I kissed the Atlantic again. I needed to wait until the man beside me ended up going to the washroom. I needed the extra second. 

"One, two, three," I whispered to myself before reaching up and grabbing the handle. It didn't WANT to move, but I was desperate enough to force it. The plane hissed and an alarm started to go off. It swung open just a touch and I got my hand out into the free air. It burned. The woman two seats over screamed.

I kicked at the door, almost shattering my ankle to break the safety. You were SUPPOSED to be able to force it open in case of emergency, but most people weren't crazy enough to try. The door got slammed shut on my arm as I forced myself out of the plane. I didn't react, it was better than dying the same way.

Then the plane was above me and I was in white. A second later I could see the blanket of clouds. It was cold. I was floating in breathless freefall for as long as I could remember. I was stuck in the middle of the air, and it was all of the sound. I closed my eyes.

"Be safe sweetie," my mother said on the other end of the phone. I almost jumped out of my skin in the taxi to the airport. 

"Yeah Mom, I will," I said without thinking about it. 

I was six hours before I hit the ground. I could change when I went back. I was alive, and my power just became a lot more than a reset button.

EXT. A GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

*Several sinister-looking figures eagerly crowd around a mausoleum. Some of these individuals are clad in cloaks or robes, others have adorned themselves with red paint and bones, and a handful of them appear to be dressed in laboratory attire.*

**AUCTIONEER:** (*O.S.*) When graveyards are left unguarded, the valuable corpses within are up for auction! Coming up: Burial Bids!    
**CAEDES:** (*O.S.*) Get on with it!

*Looking slightly dejected, a man emerges from behind the mausoleum. This is the AUCTIONEER.*

**AUCTIONEER:** Come on, guys, this is never going to take off if you don't let me do my thing.

*A man in a hooded cloak shakes his staff in the air. This is CAEDES, a necromancer.*

**CAEDES:** Sod your thing! Some of us have armies to raise!    
**AUCTIONEER:** Alright, alright, there's no need to get impatient.    
**CAEDES:** It's three in the bloody morning!    
**AUCTIONEER:** Well, we couldn't very well do this during the day, could we?    
**ELEANORE:** (*O.S.*) Why not? Any necromancer worth their bones knows that it doesn't matter! Or is this all to do with your precious "ambience?"

*A murmur of agreement moves through the assembled group. One of them, a woman in a white coat, storms forward. This is ELEANORE.*

**ELEANORE:** (*CONT'D*) Also, what was all that about "valuable corpses?" The last time we did this, all we got were chickens!    
**AUCTIONEER:** That's the risk we all take! You know that!    
**ELEANORE:** *You* buried them there!

*The auctioneer feigns a look of shock.*

**AUCTIONEER:** I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about!    
**CAEDES:** Oh, shove it. We all know this little game of yours is rigged.

*Another murmur is heard from the crowd, this one louder.*

**AUCTIONEER:** It is not! These are real graves, with unknown contents!    
**ELEANORE:** Yeah, unknown to *us*, maybe.    
**AUCTIONEER:** I have no idea what you mean.    
**CAEDES:** Do we have to spell it out? She's saying that you buy them beforehand, check them out, and then sell them to us.    
**ELEANORE:** Only after he's taken the best corpses for himself, though!

*The crowd shouts in angry agreement. The auctioneer starts to look visibly nervous.*

**AUCTIONEER:** Uh, look... should we... should we start the bidding at...    
**CAEDES:** (*Interrupting*) You know what? Maybe we should just kill *you*, enthrall your corpse, and then divide *your* army up amongst ourselves!    
**ELEANORE:** (*Shouting*) Get him!

*All of the assembled necromancers rush forward, tackling the auctioneer. A scream is heard as a geyser of blood splashes against the mausoleum. Caedes remains near the corpse as everyone else backs away.*

**CAEDES:** Well, I'm glad that's done.

*He glances down at the body.*

**CAEDES:** (*CONT'D*) Oi! Who took his eye? Lephaid, was that you? Hand it over.

*A diminutive man in a parka begrudgingly hands a slightly squished eyeball to Caedes.*

**CAEDES:** (*CONT'D*) Right. Now, then... let's have a *proper* auction, shall we? Do I hear one hundred?

"And from here on, I pronounce the noble nation of Dickbutt." 

Mark gleefully clapped his hands. Dickbutt was bigger than the United States, and looked like...well, a dickbutt. 

"Mark!" Mark's head snapped to attention. His AP Human Geography teacher, Mrs. Purples, was glaring at him. "Is there something you wish to share with the class?"

"Err...no," Mark said. Somehow, he sensed that Mrs. Purples would not be very impressed with his latest creation.

Mrs. Purples sighed. "As I was saying, physiological population density is viewed as a superior measure of population density because..."

Mark giggled, continuing to vandalize his geography book. Dickbutt needed a neighbor. He knew just what to add...

"And now, for weather..."

"I'm sorry to interrupt you, Janice, but I have breaking news!" The TV blared. The screen split to show another reporter, eyes wide and tensely clutching a mic. "A new nation has been reported to have sprouted up between the US and Mexico! No one knows where it came from, but its citizens are calling themselves the..." Here, he paused, looking a little nervous, as afraid he was going to be black-screen censored. "The...Dickbuttians."  

Mark's jaw dropped. The Fruit Loop that almost reached his mouth instead clattered with the spoon to the kitchen floor. His dad, watching the television in the living room, grunted inquiringly. 

"And between Mexico and Guatemala, a small nation that calls itself Your Mom, has also emerged." The reporter attempted a smile. "Well, however these nations came about, professionals all seem to agree that their naming seems to have come down to a middle school boy." 

Mark started, affronted. "HIGH school," he said. 

He rummaged in his backpack for his geography book. Could it be...? He opened his book to its maps section. 

"Well, I never liked North Korea," Mark said, whipping out his black sharpie.

"Her revolver is haunted by a psychotic little girl who murdered her birth parents and foster family. Doesn't run out of ammo, either. Kicks like a mule.

"How many bad guys, Marky-Mark?" Colt asks as he strutted stealthily down the bloody hallway, smoke pouring out of the barrels of 'Alice' and 'Eve'. 

"I COUNT SIX IN THE EASTERN CORRIDOR. THEY HAVE SEALED OFF EXITS 2 and 6. SWITCHING TO THERMAL-"

Colt fired another shot. "Make that five. And why's your volume so goddamn loud?"

"I DO NOT KNOW, AGENT TANNER."

Another voice comes on the comm. "It was me." Jessica sprints into the basement of the embassy and attaches explosives to the fuse boxes. 

"WHY WOULD YOU ADJUST MY AUDIO SETTINGS, AGENT KILROY?"

"It's for the time you blasted two million videos of *hardcore pornography* simultaneously on my desktop during the staff luncheon."

"...Go...to...Hell..."

Sighing, Colt fires two shots into the man's belly, tearing through his vest and rupturing his internal organs. "You first, *boy."*

"Ugh...tell my wife...she was a *bitch*..." Life fades from the man's eyes. 

The gunslinger hugs the opposite wall, peeking through the window. Five heavily armed guards patrol the area, with the ambassador tied up in a chair next to a service desk. "I see our guy. Looks roughed up. Five of those mercs are wit'em. Anyone listenin'?"

In the basement, Jessica whips out her revolver and fires two shots, taking out two mercenaries by surprise. They are reduced to ashes. A voice screams into the dark crevices of her brain. 

**"EAT THEIR FLESH! GRIND THEIR BONES! SNIFF THE POWDER!"**

"Great, another voice in my head." mutters Jessica.

"HAIL SATAN.^HAIL^SATAN". snarls the possessed gun. 

Colt reloads his weapons. "Sir Remington, we need a distraction. Jess, you ready with the light thingies? This ain't how we do things at the ranch, but it'll do nicely."

Jessica nods. "On it." She flicks open the detonator as she runs up the stairs. "Armed and ready."

"READY TO ENGAGE." informs MARK. 

"Ready to rustle and tustle, sweetheart. Sir Remington, where are-"

*"TO GLORY! TO BAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTLE!"* yells a knight dressed in full battle armor atop a prancing horse, crashing through a hole in the wall courtesy of some C4. Sir Remington slices and dices, severing arms and separating limbs with relative ease. Bullets pound into his chestplate, but Sir Remington is not fazed. 

For he is son of King Phillip III. Protector of the Royal Court.

"Tis a flesh wound! Bow down in fear, for Sir Remington is here!"

The mercenaries dive to cover, but are quickly delivered to the gates of the afterlife via a gauss sniper rifle perched 6000 meters away on a rooftop. "KILL CONFIRMED." responds MARK. 

"Copy that." Jessica presses the detonator, shutting off the power by overloading the generators. Colt puts on his night vision goggles, downs a bottle of whiskey, then goes in guns blazing, the room illuminated with brief flashes of fire and gunpowder igniting. 

One in the chamber.

One in the skull of a scumbag who thought he could escape Colt's aim. 

Sir Remington tramples a man to death, delivering the final blow with his mace. Jessica joins the fight, finishing off stragglers who may have survived the initial ambush. The shining knight gets off his mighty steed and unties the ambassador. 

"Who...who are you people?" asks the old man, scared out of his mind. "Oh dear..."

"I AM SIR REMINGTON! SON OF KING PHILIP III! PROTECTOR OF THE ROYAL-"

"Here we go again, with this fucking introduction..." complains Jessica. 

"Man's got heart, miss." says Colt, lighting a cigar. 

Back at base, the man in white stirs his coffee. "Team, report."

"Uh...everyone's dead." responds Jessica.

"How's the weather over there?"

"Rainy."

"That's England for ya."

"HAIL SATAN." screams the gun. 

"Oh, is that Jess's little helper? Tell her to be good."

Jessica rolls her eyes.

"I WILL EAT YOUR CAT." responds the psychotic spirit. 

"Okay, settle down now. See you on Tuesday. And you know what that means. Tacos are back on the menu."

#### [WP] A group of teens find a map that will lead them to friendship, only to find out that the real treasure is hidden pirate gold.

Score: 578

"You can't be serious Jake?"  Nathan looked at him incredulously.  "This is way too dangerous.  Where did you even find this map?"

Nathan looked down at the map in front of him.  "I told you Nathan, I found it online.  All it wants us to do is lower someone down the well to get to the chest at the bottom.  it's probably some kind of geocache thing."

"The rope looks fine," said Pete as he looked down the well and examined the winch.  It hadn't even crossed his mind that they wouldn't do it.

Jake, Nathan, and Pete had been friends back in the day at summer camp in Middle School.  Then High School had rolled around and with it, the notion that the escapades of their recent youth had been childish fantasies, and they'd fallen out of touch.  Fate had landed them at college within and hour of each other though and Jake had reached out to his two lost friends on Facebook.  

Everyone was excited about seeing each other again, but then Jake realized he was at a loss for what to do.  Putting years of education and practice at social interaction to use, Jake decided the obvious logical solution was to ask Google.  The top result for "Best way to reconnect with friends" had landed them on an adventure through the woods.  So far, it was working.  They all found themselves reconnecting with their old buddies as they scaled small rock faces and forded creeks as they would have at camp six years ago.

The directions had said not to read to the future steps until you accomplished the previous ones, but looking at the well, Jake wasn't so sure anymore.  They were pretty far out and no one know they were here.  Who knew where it would lead next.

Pete was already hoisting himself onto the edge of the old well though and fastening the rope around his waist, reinforcing it with straps from his pack.  

"Pete, this isn't a good idea."  Nathan's voice quavered with indecision.  He knew that what they were doing was always the preface to a story about a horrible accident, but he didn't want to be the wet blanket of the group either.  

"Don't worry Nathan, it'll be fine," said Pete.  "You two just grab that end and lower me and I'll call up when I get whatever's down there and you can pull me up on the winch."

Pete made it sound so simple.  Once everyone was at their stations, he pulled his feet from the edge of the well and let himself hang over the gaping hole.  "Alright, go for it," and down he went.

Jake guessed that they'd lowered him thirty feet or so before he called up for them to stop.  They fastened the rope on the winch and peered down into the well.  They could see his flashlight moving around but couldn't make anything out.  After a couple minutes, they heard him call back up and starting cranking the winch.

Pete resurfaced wearing a pirate hat and holding a cutlass.  Under his arm was a small chest.  "Guys check this out!  How cool is this?"

Jake took the sword from him as he pulled himself over the lip of the well.  To his surprise, it was real, and it looked old.  He swung it around a couple times.

"Jesus Jake, watch where you're swinging that!"  Nathan jumped back even though the sword was a good three feet from him.

"Calm down Nathan," came Pete's voice as he leaned over the tiny chest.  Nathan muttered a reply under his breath, but they all leaned in together as he opened the chest.  To their disappointment, all it held was a small, silver key.

"Some treasure," snorted Nathan.

"There's still a couple steps left," said Jake.  "It'll probably lead to something cool."

So, unfolding the next step and ignoring Nathan's complaints, they wandered deeper into the woods.
_____

Half an hour later found them at a large rock face.  Jake could hear the sound of waves crashing on the beach on the far side of the rock formation.  He'd been born inland, and it always amazed him how loud the ocean was.  

He and his friends for feeling up and down the rock looking for a tiny hole that was said to fit the key they'd found at the well but they'd been looking for fifteen minutes and hadn't had any luck so far.

"Wait...I got something," came Nathan's voice.  Even he'd gotten caught up in the idea of treasure and it had renewed his sense of adventure.

Pete and Jake ran over and Pete inserted the key into the hole.  It turned easily and to their amazement, a false stone wall slide away from the surface of the rock revealing a hollowed out tunnel.

"Dude.  Jake, this is the greatest treasure hunt ever," said Pete, his mouth hanging open.  To his left, Nathan didn't look so sure.

The list had recommended that they bring flashlights and they pulled them out.  Pete took the lead down the narrow passage followed by Jake with Nathan taking up the rear.  "It's just like the Goonies," came an awed whisper from Pete in the front.

As if on cue, a rumbling sounded in the Earth and Jake grabbed Pete's pack and pulled him backwards.  A boulder slid across the path in front of them through a concealed tunnel.  As they stared in stunned shock, it continued rolling back and forth before losing momentum and settling just off the path.

"Alright guys, that's it," came Nathan's voice.  "This is crazy.  Someone's going to get hurt.  I don't know what you found Jake, but we're not supposed to be here.  This is nuts!"

"Nathan, are you serious?" came Pete's voice.  "This is everything we always talked about when we were little.  We can't stop now.  We have to finish this."

Nathan stared at him in disbelief.  "Are you kidding?  Someone could die.  This isn't just a game anymore!  If you want to go on, go for it, but I'm going back.  Jake, you coming?"

Jake wanted to go back with Nathan.  That was the smarter thing to do, but Pete was right.  This was the adventure he'd always dreamed about, and now that they knew what they were up against, they'd be fine.  The boulder was hardly big enough to kill anyone.  Just would have done a bit of damage is all.

"I'm going with Pete."  The words stumbled out of his mouth and Nathan looked at him like he was crazy.

After a moment, Nathan's senses came back to him.  "Fine.  Be that way, but I'm leaving.  You can guys finish this stupid mission on your own."

"At least leave your light," said Pete as Nathan turned.  He threw it on the ground and walked away into the darkness.  "Well, mate.  Looks like it's just me and you," he said to Jake.  For some reason, that sent shivers down Jake's spine.

They continued through the passages avoiding a couple more traps, but still nothing lethal.  Jake was glad they'd seen them though.  It wouldn't have been fun to crawl out of here with a broken ankle.  

Finally, a light appeared in front of them at the end of the tunnel.  Jake released a sigh of relief and started walking towards it, but Pete reached out and grab his shoulder.  "Wait," he said quietly.  He used the end of Nathan's light to push a pressure plate on the floor and an arrow released from a trap and shot across the tunnel in front of them.

The color drained from Jake's face.  "Pete, maybe Nathan was right.  That could have killed someone.  Maybe this is crazy.  We should go."

"Jacob, Jacob" came Pete's voice menacingly in the dark.  "There's only one step left once we're out of here.  We're so close!  You can't leave me now."

Jake didn't like the way Pete was talking, but Pete was right.  They were so close.  Against his better judgment, he pushed onward.  

There were no more traps in the tunnel and the pair emerged victorious on the beach revealing the ocean that Jake had heard earlier.  Although it was beautiful, there was nothing here but some trees and it was far too cold to go swimming.

"Open the last clue Jake," said Pete.  Jake pulled it from his pocket and unfolded it.  

*If ye be wantin' me treasure, ye have to dig where the two trees cross.  Good work matey.*

Jake looked up from the note and found Pete pointing to a place up the beach where the branches of two trees crossed clearly forming an "X".

The pair tore down the beach and up to the tree.  They hadn't brought shovels, but that didn't stop them from digging into the sand with their hands.  The spot was far enough up that they didn't have to worry about the tide.  It didn't seem like it reached this far.  Finally, the corner of a chest emerged.  After a few more minutes of frantic digging, the full chest was revealed.

Pete patted Jake on the shoulder.  "Do you want to do the honors?"  Jake leaned forward and grabbed the latch of the chest, thoughts of wealth and fame tearing through his mind.  He unleashed the latch and pulled it open.  The glow of gold was interrupted by a flash of brown as a makeshift spear shot up and stabbed him through the chest.

Pete took him and laid him gently down on the beach, his breathing frantic.  But instead of helping, Pete turned back to the gold.

"Pete," Jake croaked out.  "D-did you know?"  It was becoming difficult to speak.

"I didn't know, but I suspected," came Pete's voice as he lifted a coin from the chest and examined it.  "But don't worry matey."  His voice seemed to shift.  "Ye won't be forgotten.  All's left to do is hunt down that traitorous vagrant Nathan and then it's off to the high seas."

#### [WP] A world in which Good and Evil are career fields, and heros and villains battle daily...from 9am-5pm. Except now two friends- a hero and a villain- have begun to suspect there's more going on behind the scenes.

Score: 565

The Blue Bolt slammed his third shot in so many minutes and shook his head, causing the turquoise mask to go slightly akilter. He made his way back to the table, already wobbling just a bit. One downside to having super speed is that you also have a super metabolism that processes alcohol into the bloodstream almost instantaneously. Across from him, Professor Geroth looked up from his newspaper. "You're going to destroy your liver like that, you know."

Bolt just snorted and waved a finger at the waitress to bring another round. "So? This is like... my third one already. Don't you all have access to lab-grown organs on the villain health plan?"

Geroth shrugged. "We do, but that doesn't mean I want to *use it* all the time. You know, I used to tell my minions not to hit you too hard. For professional courtesy and whatever. But if you're just abusing your body like this, I'm going to tell them to give it everything they've got."

"HA!" he laughed and eyed the waitress approaching with his booze like a dog staring at a treat in its master's hand. "When have your minions ever landed a *finger* on me? You know I'm too fast for them."

"Yeah, whatever." Geroth went back to reading his newspaper. "Hey, did you see this story?" He turned the front of the paper towards Bolt, who gulped down his fourth shot before the waitress had even put the glass on the table. 

A goofy, lopsided grin that Geroth saw most nights at the bar was spreading across the Bolt's face. He was officially drunk. "*See it?* I was there!" He pointed to the large photo taking up most of the front page, showing Gorillord being thrown through the side of a tanker ship down at the docks. Bolt wasn't clearly in the photo, but there was a blue blur right there in the middle that most people in the city recognized anyway. The large headline atop the page proclaimed: **BLUE BOLT DOES IT AGAIN!** "I thought you had super intelligence, man."

"Not that, you dolt." Geroth raised the level of the paper just a bit to point out one tiny article that had just barely made the bottom corner of the front page; most of it had been relegated to the depths of page A12. "A journalist who was investigating the First Republic Bank of Frian for money laundering was killed under mysterious circumstances. Killed in a car accident on the opposite side of the city... found in the driver's seat, and yet he didn't even own a car or have a license."

Bolt wasn't even listening anymore; he was locking eyes with a blonde who had just strolled past, and a nuclear explosion across the table probably wouldn't be able to break his concentration now. One upside to working for the Hero side is all of the public adoration; there was a reason that Bolt was still in his costume *hours* after his shift ended, while Geroth was wearing blue jeans and a tweed jacket over an unassuming sweater. "Yeah, so?" Bolt managed to answer, still drooling over the girl.

"Look, one thing about super intelligence is that you notice patterns, OK?" Geroth turned back to the paper and read over the article for the tenth time. "And I've noticed that every time *I* get a new assignment to hatch some evil scheme, it just *happens* to coincide with FRBF getting into some sort of trouble or doing something suspicious." When he looked back up, his friend was no longer sitting at the table across from him, but instead had flashed across the bar and had his spandex-clad arm around the blonde's shoulder. Geroth rolled his eyes and turned to the back page of the article, looking for anything useful.

"You're making a big deal out of nothing," Bolt said from across the table again. He had a habit of doing that: just zipping from one place to another like a hummingbird with ADHD. "We're on the front page like every day." He beamed a bit as he remembered all of his past exploits that were framed and hanging on the wall of his den. "So *of course* it's going to line up with every time that this bank gets into trouble."

"Don't you even care?" Geroth spat out. "The only thing you give a shit about is that girl's number!" He said it sarcastically, but Bolt grinned and raised his palm (covered in black sharpie) to show that he'd already gotten it. Geroth just rolled his eyes. "I thought you were supposed to be the *hero* here."

Bolt shrugged, already eyeing a different target in a short skirt. "I'm off the clock, buddy. I'll be a hero again around 9:30 AM tomorrow. As soon as I leave..." he squinted at the black sharpie on his hand "*Bethany's* apartment."

"Forget it," Geroth grumbled. He stood from the bar stool and stormed out of the bar, letting the wooden door slam shut behind him.

Halfway down the block, a gust of wind blew past. "All right, man," Bolt said from right beside him, slurring his words a little. "Let's do a little freelance work, eh? Will that make you feel better?"

Geroth grimaced, waiting for him to make some kind of joke. But Bolt actually seemed sincere. "We'll need more information..." Geroth said, more muttering to himself than actually talking to his hero companion. "I'll need to check previous newspapers to see how far back the correlation goes..."

Before he'd even finished his sentence, Bolt zipped off in a flash of blue and returned a moment later with a stack of newspapers, including *tomorrow's* paper. "The Herald's office was unlocked!" he said cheerfully before letting out a loud burp. "What's next, chief?"

#### [WP] A group of aliens is baffled by the fact we still have organized religions at this stage of development. To get answers, they abduct two spiritual leaders for questioning. To be more specific, they grab Pope Francis and the leader of ISIS...

Score: 515

"Sweet Sister Mary, what on Earth is going on here? What is that sinful *abomination* doing at the table with us?" Pope Francis asked wildly, his hat bobbing. There were three other people sitting with him, and two weren't even *people*.

"Surely, human, you can be a more civilized guest in this hall," an enormous, purple, furry being stated firmly. It looked like Yogi bear, if Yogi had been raised a meth addict.

"Oh, not you, sir. *Him*." Francis was pointing at Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, who spat on the table in response.

"I'd say he brought us here for a discussion amongst the enlightened, but you are here," Abu Bakr responded in perfect Spanish. The Pope raised his eyebrows, turning to the aliens.

"Yes, we noticed your species still cannot communicate amongst itself properly- I don't know how you can voyage into space but not speak with one another, though that is another issue entirely. We have set up a universal communication rig, so you can communicate freely," one of the aliens responded.

"What is it you would like from us?" Francis asked surprisingly calmly.

"Answers. We have been watching your species for some time now, and we would like to know a few things. First of all, why does your species have religion at this stage in development?"

Abu Bakr snickered. "Allah is the reason we exist. We aim to please him, by purging the world of those who would be unfit in his eyes."

Francis groaned, rubbing at his temples. "Look, your species seems very intelligent. I would love to discuss these issues with you, but this guy here, he's... well, you know. Insane? Religion is a vessel by which we explore ourselves, our souls, and connect with God. This man uses it as a vice to harm others."

"You did not answer my question. Why do you still believe in it? The books were written when your species still believed that Earth was the center of the universe. It has sections that don't make any sense at all, clearly written by men. Why do you still believe it?"

"It was written by men, yes," Francis answered, "but the message is God's alone. We are here to live proper lives and do what we can to help others. We are God's servants, and each day is a test of our faith. Time will not change that, not in any way."

"And you? What do you say?" The alien asked the ISIS leader.

"I say this man and his ideals are trash. Nothing but lies meant to lead people down the wrong path, away from Allah."

"You did not answer my question. Why do you still believe it?"

"Because it is the written word."

"Okay...that- that's the only reason why?"

"Yes, it is the written word and we will purge everyone who disagrees."

"If I may, this man is the worst representative you could have chosen," Francis interjected. "I have read the Qu'ran, three times now, and it is a book of love and unity. Too often to men mistake their personal angers for God's will, as if they are prophets themselves."

Abu Bakr tried to respond, but the alien disallowed it. "I see. Your species is...odd. It has appeared to evolve in stages."

"Stages?"

"Yes, stages. Those who have realized that their gods were made up to control and comfort the masses through human emotion, those who still believe it but attempt to better society with it, and those who still view it as a weapon. Staggered evolution, how incredibly odd. And to think, you can't even speak the same language. No wonder your species is in such constant turmoil. How you even made it this far is beyond me..."

"You insult Allah, you are an enemy combatant to me," Abu Bakr shouted, standing up. The quiet alien vaporized him with some kind of laser.

"Grngk, I told you no weapons! Look at what you've done now! The humans will hate us, we are supposed to be a diplomatic people!"

Francis leaned back, raising his eyebrows. "Now, normally, I object to that sort of thing, but...I think that in this case, we can make an exception."

#### [WP] You're a police officer in the late 19th century hunting down an escaped mental patient named Sherlock Holmes who is an alcoholic, drug addict, and self proclaimed detective.

Score: 510

The sounds of his foot steps on the cobble road echoed off the tight alley walls. When he was lost in thought he often took walks. Sometimes these walks took him much further from home than anticipated, and on a few occasions into areas of town he dared only to tread due to his position. For the last two months he'd been following this case. 

A man by the name 'Sherlock Holmes' had escaped custody of a sanatorium, and has sense gone on to elude police capture. At first they didn't think much of it. Just some poor loon who'd gone and broken out. His file said he had a thing for the bottle and was reported as having frequented opium dens. Then they heard how he escaped. It would seem that despite his diagnosis Holmes was quite the adversary. He managed to incapacitate a guard, secure a uniform, and altered his appearance just enough to evade suspicion. When questioned the guard at the gate said he saw a slight looking male nurse leave about an hour before Holmes was reported missing. The bastard managed to walk right out the door.

From there things only became more odd. Holmes, it would seem, has an affinity for solving crimes. In the two months since he escaped he has left hints, notes, and on one occasion risked his own capture to lead officers to criminals. Were he a copper he would have had an impressive number of collars. The citizens began to idolize him and meanwhile the police force caught hell from the chief of police all the way to members of Parliament. 

The officer paused and leaned against a wall. From his pocket he produced a cigarette and brought it to his lips. He reached for his lighter only to find it wasn't in his pocket. He began to feel about at his coat and trousers when the sound of a match strike alerted him to someone else's presence in the alley.

"Need a light," a thick cockney accent asked. 

He looked to his left. Just a ways away from him stood a man with shaggy hair holding a lit match. The flame illuminated just enough to show the patches of dirt on his face. Even from a distance the officer could smell the booze on him. 

"You shouldn't sneak up on a police officer, sir. Bad for my health and quite possibly yours. But it would seem I am in need of a light so your presence is welcome."

The boozy man chuckled sightly and snuffed out the match. He lit another and made his way over slowly. Once close by his gingerly brought the flame to the end of the cigarette and lit it. The officer took a drag and exhaled a cloud of smoke into the cool night air. 

"Mind if I join ya," the boozy man pulled a weathered pipe from his tattered rags.

"By all means. It would seem I'm in your alley anyway."

The boozy man hummed and chuckled wryly. He struck another match and lit his pipe with a couple of puffs. 

"So what brings you to my side of town, eh?"

"Just out for a stroll actually," the officer said exhaling more smoke, "helps me think."

"A good walk can clear the mind I suppose," his manner of speaking had changed slightly. 

The officer hummed in agreement. As his cigarette burned to ash he produced another and motioned for another light. This time the boozy man brought out a small, gold lighter and flicked it to make a flame. He brought it to the tip of the cigarette when the officer noticed something. That was his lighter. The cigarette fell from his lips and he looked at the boozy man.

"Where did you," he stammered, "how did you get this lighter?"

"That's a waste of a cigarette you know," the mans diction was clear now. His accent more refined and precise. 

"That is *my* lighter," the officer said snatching it out of the mans hand. 

"I procured it earlier when you were walking, John. You really should be more aware. If I can pick your pocket I'm not sure how you survive the hordes of street children."

John grabbed the boozy man by his collar and slammed him to the wall. 

"Now, now officer Watson," the man said, "let's not be so rash."

John slammed the mans back against the wall.

"Who the hell are you and how do you know me? You picked my pocket? When I never-," he paused. He eyes grew wide. 

"I most certainly did take your lighter but I was not wearing these rags. And I smelled significantly less like a tavern floor. Which is where I found this shoddy coat actually. A little soot from the fire place on my face, a change in speech pattern, and since I've grown my hair out there's no way you'd know me immediately."

"Holmes," John said gravely, "I finally got you this time."

"Yes, you were quite close the last time. Thankfully I was able to elude you and bring you right to that drug shipment. I was also able to take a little for myself, so really we all won."

"Well now I've got you in my hands and I'm bringing you in."

"You're not the least bit curious as to why I just turned myself in to you? I evade capture for 67 days and I just willingly give myself to the man who was closest to catching me?"

Johns brow furrowed. He had a point. There's no reason for this. Maybe he was done running? No that was too simple. Holmes wouldn't just quit. 

"I'll give you 30 seconds."

"I don't need that many to tell you there is to be an attempt on the lives of the police chief and his family sometime in the next hour."

Johns blood ran cold. Was he setting John up? Was this an attempt at escaping? But then again Holmes had "helped" capture almost 20 criminals now, and all of his hints and clues were correct in leading to their capture. 

"How do you know that?"

"I have eyes in the city. Information dead drops most everywhere. I know people who know people and gather intelligence as I require. This seemed important enough to warrant direct confrontation with one of London's finest officers. Not a great detective, mind you, but certainly a good officer."

John gritted his teeth. The information was processing in his mind. There was no reason he couldn't just take Holmes in and interrogate him for information. But he may not talk at all and if the chiefs life was truly in danger he wouldn't acknowledge it without evidence. Hell even with evidence he may not pay it any mind. But if his family was also in danger then it made matters even more pressing. Then there was the time constraint. 

"Well?"

John looked at Holmes. *Fuck* he said internally. 

"I let you help me on this and I guarantee your safety and escape. That's what you want, right?"

"Yes and no," Holmes spoke calmly, "yes you will let me help you, but I won't be 'escaping' so much as continuing to help you."

"I beg your pardon?"

"I propose a partnership. I like solving these cases and the thrill it brings but I can't do it in the open. I can act upon those criminals but I'd surely be deemed a vigilante or killed. Rather I will help you become a detective, you will bring them to me, I help you and you get a criminal off the street."

"So you're just a good person, huh? Why not become a cop if you wanted to catch criminals so badly?"

"Please if you want to solve crimes and get results you don't become a cop. The restrictions hold you back, and your outward appearance kills off leads and sources who don't speak to police. I like the thrill of the chase. The harder the better. Nothing more than that?"

"So the police chiefs life and the lives of his family have no barring on the decision then?"

"This is a *gift* Watson. I only brought this to you as an exchange. People die everyday and many of them do so very boringly. The fact this saves lives is of little importance to me but to you," he trailed off.

John tensed up and his arms shook. He exhaled sharply as he released his grip and shoved Holmes away. Holmes extended his hand.

"Partners?"

John eyed him warily. He stuck his hand out begrudgingly and squeezed Holmes hand as they shook. 

"Just tell me what is going to happen or who is involved and we'll go from there."

"Very well. This way Watson," Holmes turned sharply and began to walk briskly out of the alley. 

John stared at him and then began to follow behind. 

"It's 'Officer Watson'."

"Please, John, we're partners now. We can drop formalities."

#### [WP] Humans are known in the galaxy for being a bit dim, but also for being the very best mechanics around, and inexplicably able to fix machines beyond their comprehension. You have broken down on Earth, and having the apes work on your craft is both fascinating and terrifying.

Score: 504

Xel’thor had heard the stories about these earth men, apes really, being the paragon of mechanical ingenuity, but surely those had been exaggerations.   Passing through that asteroid field was a bad idea, Xel’thor thought.  The power failure to the deflector shields couldn’t have come at a worse time; the impacts from those asteroids must have knocked the crystal containment system out of equilibrium.  At least the two humans seemed willing enough to help, towing the cruiser to some kind of red wooden building.  

“Now don’t you worry Mr. Eltho, Clem here’ll get ya all patched in no time.”

“It’s Xel’thor”

“Pardon?”

“It’s Xel’thor, Norman.  See I took the time to listen and remember your name.”

“Now, there’s no need to be rude mister,” Norman replied.  Xel’thor stared at Clem and Norman.  Norman and Clem had been in the field when Xel’thor’s ship came crashing down, working on a large green tractor.  Great, Xel’thor thought to himself.  I need to make contact with my handler halfway across the sector two hours from now.  And now the fate of the Osgrellian Empire rests on a man wearing grease stained overalls without a shirt and an old man in a cowboy hat.  

“Clem, if it’s quite alright with you, I’d like to oversee the repairs.  You see, this ship and the contents of its data safe are actually quite important.  The-”

“Yeah that’s fine Mr. Elmore.  You can hand me shit from my toolbox.” Clem interrupted.

“...Great….Also, it’s Xel-thor.”

Clem plugged in a work light and slid underneath the cruiser.    Norman walked over to an old radio and turned it on.  The sound of country music filled the old barn.  “I’m gonna go grab some coffee fellas.  Clem, I’ll bring you back your usual.  Mr. Velcro, would you like some coffee while ya wait?”

“No”

“Alrighty then, I’ll leave you two to it.”

Xel-thor dozed off for nearly an hour when the sound of pounding metal brought him back to alertness.  It appeared to Xel-thor that Clem had merely started beating the side of the cruiser with some kind of large hammer.  
“What the *hell* are you doing to my ship?”

“See, you got quite a few dents here mister.  I’m pounding them out.”

“This may be a little too complex for you earthling, by this ship is powered by a Osgrellian crystal reactor.  They’re exceedingly-”

“Delicate” Clem said.

“...uhh yes.  Delicate.  Very delicate.”

“See I figured that.  That’s why I put it over there on yonder table.  Now, I may be just a humble mechanic, but seems like these dents are poking into that crystal’s containment doo-hickey.  So you aint going anywhere til we get these dents fixed.”

Xel-thor stood there speechless as Norman returned with two paper cups of coffee.  “Alright, I got one black for me and one double skinny orange happy-cino for you Clem.” Norman said.  “So was it like ya figured Clem? Dents causing trouble with the power core’s containment system?”

“Yeah, more or less.  This one had a crystal instead of the usual anti-matter though.” Clem replied, taking his coffee.  “Bigger problem is with the shields.  I gave the generator the old once over, but I don’t think there’s anything technically wrong with it.  Looks like it might not be compatible with the ship since it’s an aftermarket model.”  Both Clem and Norman stared at Xel-thor, sipping coffee.

“I was assured it was the right model….”

“Uh-huh.  Betcha that salesman was more than happy to look that up for you too, huh.” Clem said.

“Now, Clem don’t be hard on the fella.  Some folks is just a little slower than others.”

“I am *not* slow. I’m *very* important and am *very* smart.”

“Sure ya are Mr. Xel-thor.  So the way I figure it, I’ll set ya up with this older spare shield generator I got, rated for a ship of your class, and I’ll hold onto this one.  With parts and labor, I reckon that should square us up.” Clem said. 

Fifteen minutes later, Xel-thor’s ship took off and was in orbit in a matter of seconds.  Clem and Norm stood in the field looking toward the sky.  “You know that fancy shield generator was rated for his ship just fine, right Clem?”

“Well of course I know that Norman.  We gotta make money somehow though, Norm."

#### [WP] Reddit karma works exactly like mana in real life, the more you have of it allows increasingly greater spells and abilities you can wield. But nobody considered what the greatest negative karma holders might be able to do...

Score: 486

We called him Unidan. For aeons he was a force of good - a hugely powerful sorcerer and the wisest of all living beings. His knowledge was astonishing.  

Many called him an oracle and some worshipped him as a living God. They were right to do so for his power rivalled that of any God. Everyday he was worshipped with a million up-votes. Every day his power increased.

His reign was called *the Benevolence*. Just and kind and wise. If ever a darkness arose or trolls escaped from the lower echelons of the Earth, Unidan destroyed them in a raging storm of fire and flame. We thought he was protecting *us*. Later we found out the truth.

After a great period of time Unidan began to turn his malice on the innocent. He developed a mad thirst for power, a lust for control that compelled him to destroy any potential rivals. Good men died but he would reassure us it was for a 'greater good'. He was a master of manipulation.

We began to understand what he was doing. We tried to stop him, to weaken his power with downvotes. Humanity came together to destroy the evil we had created, but we made a grave mistake. No one knew the consequences of such negative karma. My god, if only we had known.

His reign of prosperity ended and so began the age of Malevolence. 

Unidan changed physically. He no longer cared about his facade. His eyes gradually blackened and it was said the darkness of hell could be seen within them. Giant scaled wings sprouted from his shoulder blades. Huge horns rose from his skull. Madness consumed him. 

He began the systematic genocide of the popular, for no mortal could be allowed to reach a level of power that could challenge him. Everyday, a random person with over 10,000 karma would be executed. It took years but he culled them all. He then began on the over 5000, then then 1000. People were afraid to give anyone karma as it might mean a death sentence.

The negative karma accounts worshipped him and became his followers.

Life was bleak and it was impossible to see a future outside of Unidan's grasp. 

But then, a hero arose.

This is his story.

Hi RatsAss24. It is good to see a new user - it has been a long, long time. I saw your post and anon is right, you must be careful talking about this kind of stuff. The one he refers to is called 'Unidan'. He is not a very nice person, and he is incredibly powerful. He can erase *your very existence*. 

**Reply to ChaosBill**    

Hi! Thanks for the message. Erase me? You mean my account right?    

**New message from ChaosBill**    

I mean he will literally kill you. You're new around here so let me explain. The more upvotes you get, the higher your karma levels. The higher your karma, the more powerful you become. The same is true of negative karma. Unidan has more negative karma than was thought possible.

**Reply to ChaosBill**

Wow. That's pretty scary. What can we do?

**New message from ChaosBill**

Hm. In the past we tried to fight him. The strong, like gallowboob, fought him in battle, but that was a mistake. Negative Karma is much stronger than Positive Karma.  Unidan was too powerful and defeated, then executed gallowboob. Then vargas. Then awildsketchappeared. Then all of the hyper positives.

Now there is only Unidan who controls such power. 

I shouldn't really be telling you this but there are a small group of us who are trying to bring him down...*from the inside*. We have a private subreddit - it has a invisibility charm that stops him from seeing into it. I will send you an invite.

Hi guys. ChaosBill invited me to the sub. Look, I have heard about Unidan. I want to help bring him down, and I have got a plan. He is not going to let anyone get *more* karma than him, that much is clear. 

But he won't mind me getting building up some negative karma if he thinks I am one of his believers...   then I post something so awful, so terrible, that my negative karma overtakes his! What do you guys think?

#### An 13 year old angsty pre-teen is given an actual sword that gets stronger with every kill, the only problem is it's at stage 0 and has the damaging power of a plastic spoon. [WP]

Score: 478

A boy found a small knife by the lakeside, in the forest that sat by his family home. It was small. Light. Pathetic. The boy could relate. He too found himself small, light and pathetic. 

"Then make it grow. Kill, and the knife will become more."  

Maybe the boy could also become more. The thin knife felt comfortable in his hand. They would grow together then.   

It started with bugs. He pressed the flat end of the knife on a line of ants into the summer stone. Their shells crackled and popped under the pathetically light weight of his, "weapon." The town girls pointed at him kneeling over a slab, digging his fingers underneath to try and flip it over. He's gross, they said. The other boys ignored him. If he wasn't going to rough house with them while the adults worked the fields, then they didn't care what the strange boy did.  

Under the slab, there were lots of bugs. The boy got to work.    

Twenty colonies later, it became more. The boy didn't *feel* like more though. It grew into a dagger without him. This angered him.  

So it continued with animals. The boy thrust the dagger into a cow. Then some chickens. When he would play in the forest by their family home, the boy hunted. It was easy, now that the dagger had grown into a rapier. He felt quick holding it. Fast. Light.  

The rapier became a sword. It grew without him, even as four deer lay several feet behind him. He continued to be 13, and small, and full of anxiety. Though the boy was fascinated by what he could do, he saw that it was not his power. Not anymore. The sword outgrew him. Now he was just small, light and pathetic.  

The boy cried by the lakeside, seeing now that only the sword became stronger.   

"Then return it to me."  

In his tantrum, the boy flung the sword into the lake that spoke to him. A hand caught it by the handle.  

"This will do," the female voice said.     

The boy ignored the lake. He was angry. Despite all the things he killed, he continued to be nothing. He was now a killer of deer, and chickens, and cows, and bugs. The lake was silent, leaving the boy to his self-pity. After all, the lake got what it wanted.  

This was how legendary swords were forged. In the furnace and fire of children with big dreams, who did whatever it took to achieve them. Excalibur was no different. One theory by how the sword was given that name, is that it comes from an Old French word. *Escalibor.*  

It means 'corruption of Caliburn.' 

The poor boy. Though the legendary sword would go on to accomplish great things, the boy was tainted and burnt by his failure. All he wanted was to accomplish great things of his own. Caliburn *killed* for that opportunity.  

An opportunity that was destined for another.

Score: 473

To my dearest friends, 

Hey, everyone back at St. John's, I know I was supposed to wait before sending a letter but I just have so much to say! Everyone in my new home is so lovely and wonderful, my dad tucks me in every night and my mom is teaching me how to sculpt! Clay is an amazing medium, with so much potential. Lovely birds, foxes and owls to daisies and petunias- I can make it all, now! Anything at all, I can create with the help of my mom. You wouldn't believe how kind she is, always providing me with fresh materials to practice on. 

I'm learning so much here, every single day! Seriously, I hope you all find wonderful homes of your own one day. Freedom is a magical thing, one to greatly envy! Love is beautiful, especially parental love, and I'm still trying to get used to it. Every day I grow a little stronger, knowing they're supporting me so much. Sleeping in a real bed every night is incredible, too! Here, they even have these great curtains that keep the light out- you know how much I love the dark.

Surely, you will all know the wonder that is family soon enough. Each and every one of you will know what it's like to really have a mom and dad. Nobody deserves to live like an orphan, not even if you think otherwise. Dreams can come true!

Here I've just gone and rambled too much, sorry about that. Everyone here tells me I talk too much, as well. Love you all! Please respond to this letter!

#### [WP] A "popular" girl falls in love with a "nerdy" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him

Score: 457

I leaned my shoulder against the doorway and stared. The room looked enormous without all of my Marvel posters lining the walls and all of my books stacked on their shelves. All that remained was my twin bed & small desk.

The door rang cutting short my farewell to my stripped childhood abode. It was Ava dropping off my Calvin & Hobbes comics. There was no way I was going to head to Berkley & let her keep them. 

She was fidgeting & wouldn't stop talking. She never stops talking. A few months ago she wouldn't even look me in the eyes if we passed each other in the hallways. But she hasn't left me alone since I started tutoring her in physics though. Tough shit. I didn't  care how much she batted her eyelashes at me. I never gave her a free class. Not a single one.

She was rambling more than usual. Something about Kelly Sherman's boyfriend or her dog. I'd clearly missed a vital part of the story because the next thing I know she suddenly blurts out, "I'm in love with you."

"Huh?"

"I'm in love with you... I know it sounds crazy... But if you could just hear me out--"

"Hear you out??? Ava. You've scorned me since eight grade. We've been neighbors since preschool. We were best friends until my dad was caught cheating with Principal Johnston and you considered me a social pariah. You told everyone that that was probably why I was valedictorian of our middle school class. You made fun of me because my mom had to use food stamps. I could go on for a good hour for chrissakes." She flinched.

"You can't hate me. Michael, you've been tutoring me for half a year. We spend every day together... You let me watch Return of the Jedi with you..."

"Look. I'm sorry but I tutored you because it was good money for little work. And I let you watch movies with me sometimes because you lingered and I didn't want to be rude. I never thought you'd misconstrue it as mixed signals or something."

She looked like she was dealing with Bernoulli's equation. Out of impulse I almost snapped my fingers at her like I used to during our sessions when she'd zone out. 

Then she did the last thing I expected her to do. Shit. She started to tear up. Over me??? Ava Costa does not tear up over dudes. She eats them for breakfast. She's destined to be the ultimate trophy wife meets black widow. I did not have time for this.

"Look, I'm sorry. I'm moving cross country today anyways. It just wouldn't work." My taxi honked. "I gotta go." She wiped the tears from her face as she looked up at me. She almost reminded me of my long lost best friend. The one who used to squeal when I'd climb up a tree too high. The one who wouldn't even be able to water ballon an elephant standing a foot in front of her. The one who bought me a piggy bank as my 10th bday present so we could "invest" into it for a year and have enough to buy ourselves Super Soakers our parents had prohibited. 

I picked my duffel bags from the floor and walked out, hoping I don't run into her during Christmas break.

#### [WP] You are the first boss of a videogame who, after accidentally killing the player in their first try, decide to take it upon yourself to fulfill their quest.

Score: 446

The hero had made his way through my keep, torn through my defenses, and brought ruin upon the men who had pledge their lives to me. I had heard of him, as had all the other great Lords, the man who said he would slay a thousand evils in order to bring justice to the world once more. He had good reason to say so. I had heard of his tale; the village in which he hailed had been put to the torch a year ago and his family had perished within. 

My own liege Lord was the one who had done it. He had risen up against other Lords and brought his armies through the countryside, burning the villages, taking the money, and providing food for his soldiers. The war was still ongoing, but he had sent other Lords back home, to quell rebellions rising within his lands.

The hero, as he such called himself, had marched into my throne room, and drawn his sword. He was a stout young fellow, who bore a fresh set of iron-plate armor with barely a scratch on it. A bow and quiver wrapped around his torso, and a sword, covered in blood, was gripped at his side.  "A minion of the Lord Guerknot. You shall be the first to fall among the rest."

I had sat waiting for him. There was no shame in a Lord protecting his home, with his own soldiers throwing their lives before he threw his own. They had pledged themselves to me and it was *their* honor to fall in my name. "I have heard a lot about you Warren. A commoner turned soldier. A man without a family."

He raised his sword, "You do not get to speak ill of the dead!"

"You were on the wrong side of history, Warren. That is all. The wrong side of a war."

"A war that shouldn't exist."

I stood at his comment. He was never pledged to Guerknot like I was, but to speak against my Lord's war was to speak against me. "A war that you perpetuate with killing. These men did not participate in the burning. They did not destroy your village."

"They serve the one who caused it all."

I scoffed. "They serve me! No one else. They guard the people in *my* kingdom, no one else's."

"And you serve Guerknot! You think such a man cares for them? For the people? For even you?"

I laughed. It was something that the war had caused me to think about a lot. I served Guerknot because my family was pledged to them, because it was *my* duty as the Lord of Mountain's Fist to serve him. But the war had caused peril in my country, in my land. Tribesmen were active once more, pillaging and raping my people when I had men across the globe fighting a war that was not theirs to fight. My own vaults dry of coin because I spent it helping the war effort. My fields worked to ash because the troops needed food.

My people going hungry, going cold, and going into the Earth because Guerknot wished to further his Kingdom.

"I agree with you."

He did not seem to like my response as he took an aggressive step forward. "Then why would you let me kill all those men? Kill *your* men!"

I took a few steps forward, stepping down from my throne, "Because the Mountain's Fist does not take kindly to intruders. But if you pledge yourself to me. If you kneel to Wymarc of the Fist then I will provide you with an army. I will let you take revenge."

He faltered. I could see it as he thought about the offer. "This is a trick."

"Tell me, once you killed me, did you intend on taking the throne?" I continued to walk down.

He did not move.

"You'd leave the Kingdom without leaders, and when the job was done, when you finally struck down Guerknot the Besieger. Would you take over? Would you lead the Kingdom?"

Again, he faltered as he realized the truth in my words.

"Let me give you a chance at your revenge. And together, we can take down Guerknot from the inside."

He sat there for a few moments, debating to take my offer. Part of me thought he was going to, that he was happy with only the *thought* of revenge. Yet his actions proved otherwise. He lifted his sword, anger in his face, and he shouted at me. "Liar!"

He charged me, running at me with sword drawn. 

I drew my own and took the last step to even myself with him. As he swung, I ducked and spun at the last second, my cloak flying with me, the symbol of the Fist covering the room. As he turned to face me for another blow, my sword buried into his chest, through his own iron-plate and into his flesh. It did not come out the other side, instead the Sword of the Mountain stuck inside of him.

"You will be with your family again. And for you, and for the others who have fallen," I whispered, "revenge shall be granted."

He took a deep breath, and for a second I thought he smiled. I could see he was losing it, regretting his decision, but happy to be going back to his family. "Thank you."

I pulled my sword out of his chest and took a step backwards. He collapsed immediately onto the steps of my throne and I looked down upon him. He had the right idea, revolting against the Kingdom of Guerknot, but he had done it all wrong. He did not have the army, nor the power, nor the name.

But I did as the Lord of a proud and prestigious House. I had an army that wanted to take back their lands. I had the power of several vassals. And I, as Wymarc of the Mountain's Fist, had the name. In that, I would take back my forefather's Kingdom.

One mountain at a time.

#### [WP] Death spared your life and made you immortal. Over hundreds of years, you have become friends. He's been very busy with work and you miss seeing your buddy. You spend centuries attempting to create world peace, stop war and cure diseases so you can spend some quality time with your only friend.

Score: 442

Death spared my life once. It was a long time ago - almost so long that I can no longer remember it. The only thing that I can remember is being sick and willing myself not to die. I had a family that needed my support. I was a doctor myself, lying on the floor of an examination room in my own sick and repeating it in my head. *I won't die, I won't die, I won't die.*

He appeared and I thought he was a fever dream. With his black cloak and his scythe - just the way that he had always been described. I let out a sob. "No. No, you can't come for me. Not yet. I won't let you take me."

Death had no face. "I'm not here to take you. I'm here because I've never seen someone with this...resilience." The fever dream shivered, moving in the light of the doctor's office. "Are you really alive?" 

"Please," I begged. "Spare me." 

The fever dream dragged a finger across my cheek - ice against my burning skin that made me convulse and jerk and twitch on the ground. 

Then he was gone. 

I healed from the illness - one of the rare few who did. As I cleaned the sick up from my office I wondered about the hallucination. At the very end of it though I had the opportunity to go back. I went and held my wife and my three children and I went to work and I earned enough money to keep them all happy in those desolate times. The economy came and went - my children grew - and I aged very well.

In fact, it wasn't until I was about sixty that I noticed I hadn't aged at all. My wife seemed to notice it first, remarking that my skin still seemed as smooth as it had fifty years ago when we'd met. She remarked that it seemed like I was still a young man. 

She left me soon after - thought I'd been touched by the devil. She took the children with her, and then I was alone. I quit my practice and lived off the streets, wandering at night and looking at all the homeless and the dying that laid out on the curbs. I threw myself into a river but the icy water did little more than make me shiver, climbing out some frozen popsicle of a man. 

The gun left but a mark in my stomach. The rope left but a burn around my neck. 

One day, the fever dream came back. But this time I was sat on a bridge and looking over at the sunset. He came and leaned against the barrier and I looked up at him and said, "You were never a dream."

"No. I was never a dream."

"How long has it been?"

"Seventy years, eighty?"

"But you haven't come back for me?"

"I made my choice with you. You are what you are. You can never go back." 

"Then I'll have to watch the rest of them die."

"It's the unfortunate consequence. A parent watching their children die. Then their grandchildren. Eventually the grandchildren's grandchildren. You won't die. You will never die. Sometimes you'll wish you did - I know that I've been lonely a few times over the years. Maybe that's why I chose you," he seemed to be speaking more to himself than to me now. "Maybe it was just a split second decision. But your determination to live was...*impressive*, at least." 

"And they'll all die."

"Yes. They will all die." 

I stared out at the river, and then turned back to death. But he was gone. 

He came every few months to see me after that. We talked sometimes. I made him tea from my house. I invested and played the new stock market. I went back to being a doctor for a while, and then quit while I waited for everyone who had ever known me to die. Then I went back to being a doctor. The technology changed, but people remained fairly the same.

Death and I played chess. Death and I read books synchronously and then spoke about them in enthused voices as we threw back shots of vodka. Death and I spoke on the eaves of war and then he would disappear completely for years. I spent the time reading tomes of books and watching the new media as it first came out - first the VHS and then the DVD and then the VR and the IR and the CR. I read the complete *Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire*. I went though all the classics when the books were published. I traveled and let my beard grow as I went from library to library. I touched the oldest of runes. I touched runes before they were runes.

Death always found me, when he was ready to see me again. We would sit and drink and play chess and talk about everything and nothing. Death would tell me about his job and I would tell him about being a doctor, and he would make a remark or two about how it was funny for friends to be a protector of life and a taker of it. 

He was my friend. 

Three hundred years after he took my ability to die the hundred-year war began. I didn't see death for a century. He came to me one day while I was sitting in former Cambodia - the A.A.C.S flag flying overhead with its eight points and its colorless, drafty tone. 

"Been a while," I said. 

"Up for a game of chess?"

"Are you going to leave again?" 

"Only if there's another war." 

There was another war, and then another. The war against the AIs. The war between the A.A.C.S and the N.A.C.U.S that ended in the death of almost two hundred million people. Death was busy, and I was lonely. I went back to sitting on bridges and looking out. I could see the bridges as I couldn't have four or five hundred years before - through the teachings of Aristotle and Plato and the wisdom of musicians, actors, and politicians. I could think of a hundred different answers to the meaning of life but I had no one to share them with. 

Death came back one day. "Chess?" he dropped into the chair like one of the corpses he collected and I pulled out my chessboard.

"I've missed you."

"Yes. It's lonely to go so long without a friend." 

"I wish you weren't so busy."

"As long as man exists, there will be someone for me to take. It's the burden that I was given."

"Given by whom?"

"By whomever is my creator. Yours too, I suppose. *The* creator." 

I mull it over in my head as Death takes one of my rooks. After all these centuries there's still nothing that we do but play chess. Game after game after game of chess. 

It dawns on me that if I want to spend more time with Death I need to fix the problem of war. 

Of course, there is the issue of what Death said. As long as there are people, there will be war. 

I have read many books. I have studied many subjects. I have been alone with my thoughts for many years.

I know the most simple solution to that problem.

The air smelt faintly of urine.

I leant into the wall, letting the cool bricks catch my weight. The night time rush that would periodically burst from the automatic doors and flood through the Underground station had slowed to a trickle. The pale, washed out corridors all but dried up. 

I pulled my coat tighter across my chest, but the shiver had nothing to do with the cold. The next tube was still a few moments away, and my mind had begun to empty.

I stared at my shoes, unable to grasp whether I liked the shade of brown. It was not as if I was undecided, rather the opposite, I was unequivocally convinced that I had no opinion whatsoever. It was a void that spread through my mind. I quickly became equally ambivalent about the upcoming electoral debate, about what I was going to eat for dinner, about eating dinner at all.

I slouched further down the wall until I was sitting on the damp concrete floor. The colour began to drain around me, like watercolours spread to thinly across a page. Soon I was left with only a wireframe, an indicator of where things should be but not ability to build anything meaningful within the empty space.

I rested my head between my knees pressing inward with my legs, using the pain as an anchor on reality.

I love chocolate.

A little girl skipped into sight, her face smeared brown and colour bleeding from her footprints, spilling across the platform. Her opinions filled my mind. I hated the smell. I feared the train tracks. I loved unicorns. Her mum followed in toe, running onto the platform and grabbing the girl’s hand. 

The tube screeched to a halt, and as the doors opened I could see once again, through the many lenses crafted by years of unique experience.

People pushed passed me, and I smiled as they built my world.

#### [WP] You have the ability to reverse time by 6 hours whenever you're about to die. You're currently on a 10 hour flight on a plane that's about to crash.

Score: 439

I made a decent living working for the government.  I never told them how I was able to do it, but I could predict major events and disasters hours before they happened.  But they weren't predictions, they were actually events I experienced.  That's my secret, I'm always reliving time.  Well not always, it's an odd power.

I discovered my ability when I fell through the ice while skating at a lake near our Minnesotan home.  I didn't have the strength to get back to the surface and I felt the lake sucking the life right out of me.  Suddenly everything stopped.  Time froze, and floating in front of my face read the phrase "Load Last Checkpoint?"  I hit Y...with my mind...somehow.  And suddenly I was back at home, waking up that morning.

I quickly learned the specifics of how my power worked.  The split second before I die, time will freeze and let me rewind the last 6 hours.  So when 9/11 happened, I stole my dad's gun and used it.  I called the cops, I called everyone, no one believed me.  Who's going to listen to a guy ranting about a terrorist attack at 5 in the morning?

Obviously the FBI found me afterwards and brought me in to explain myself.  With some clever time travel tricks (Joe will spill his coffee in 3...2...1) I was able to convince them I had psychic powers.  Seemed easier than trying to explain something I never even fully understood.

Over the years I must have stopped hundreds of terrorist attacks, assassinations, and got people evacuated in time before natural disasters.  I always carried a sidearm with me in case of an emergency rewind.  I think I've shot myself over a thousand times in my life.  I finally decided to take a break and go on vacation to Sydney.  Which brings me to the present.  I boarded Oceanic flight 816 to LAX heading home after my much needed vacation.

The in-flight movie was some terrible romcom.  So I watched a personal classic on my laptop.  Hook.  I always related to Peter Pan in that I could live forever,  I could have stayed a young boy if I had wanted to, just constantly replaying a day over and over.  (Tried it once, it gets really boring, I feel sorry for Bill Murray).

I don't know how they found out about me, or my powers.  I've never told a soul about how it works until now.  But somehow they figured it out.  They waited until after we were six hours into the flight before taking over the plane.  The leader told me there was nothing I could do.  They were watching me the entire flight, and any attempt to do anything would have resulted in them tying me up.  I tried everything I could think of.  They were thorough.  Two of them sat on either side of me unbeknownst to me for those six hours.  There was no way I could kill myself.

Everytime I failed, we crashed into the secret nuclear missile facility in Nevada(the *real* Area 51, the one on Google Maps is a fake).  Effectively setting off two hundred nukes and obliterating the entire Western half of the country.  At least, that's what they said was going to happen.  And judging by the explosion right in front of my face everytime time froze, I'd say they were right.

I have spent almost a year trying to find a solution to this problem.  There's no way for me to get back to before the flight took off.  They knew what they were doing and planned this all too well.  It's impossible.  The best I can do is fight my way into the cockpit and lock myself in when they let their guard down.  This plane will never make it to Nevada.

So I write this to inform you that the United States no longer has their safeguard.  They are vulnerable to attacks and assassinations once more.  The masses thought that things were fine since 9/11, when in reality it was all me.

I don't know which reference I want to make for my true last words.  The Captain America parallel is obvious.  Groundhog Day too cliched.  I'm almost out of time now.  We're less than 10,000 feet above the Sierras now.  Down to just a minute or two.  I've lived an amazing life.  More than any man ever has.  I suppose now is as good a time as any.

To die will be an awfully big adventure.

I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY THAT. MY REACTION IS DIFFERENT. THE PLATYPUS IS STUPID. JUST STUPID AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR CREATING IT. IF YOU WEREN'T A GREAT DESIGNER I WOULD SEND YOU TO HELL. 

"Whoa, what? Are you kidding me?"

NO, I HATE IT. 

"It's in Australia. Gabe gave kangaroos three vaginas, and he was promoted. I design something like this, and you're talking about hell. Seriously?"

YES. 

"You knew I would make this. You knew that. You've given me design notes before. Hell, you can guide me without telling me. You can control me. Your self-hating bullshit has gone too far. I made something weird that stands out, and you don't like it?"

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. 

"Adam and Steve was an interesting concept and you ended that right quick anyway."

THERE'S MORE. 

"Like?" Asks Bart. 

THE GIANT SLOTH, THE MOA, THE THUNDERBIRDS, AND THE DINOSAURS. 

"All extinct. You ended them all. Every last one of them. I design life on Earth, remember? If those are my own only mistakes, well, that seems pretty good. Oh wait, you're infallible supposedly. What is this really about? I'm not getting back together with Lucy, threats or not." Says Bart. 

ALRIGHT FINE, I KIND OF LIKE THE PLATYPUS. IT'LL MAKE HUMANS MORE ACCEPTING WHEN THEY FIND THE DUCK PLANET, BUT LUCY IS UPSET. SHE MIGHT NOT TAKE NEW ARRIVALS BECAUSE OF IT. THERE'S NO HOPE FOR RECONCILIATION? 

"It's been two million years. She's nice, but all she talks about is torture and punishment, and I'm sure the sex would have phenomenal if we had genitals, hint hint." 

NO GENITALS FOR ANGELS. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. LOOK AT THE MADHOUSE IT IS ON EARTH BECAUSE OF GENITALS. 

"Good point, but, you know, sex looks great."

IT'S THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING EVER. THAT'S WHY I CREATED HEROIN. 

"Ooo, can I have that?"

NO. I KNEW THAT'S WHERE THIS CONVERSATION WAS GOING, AND I STILL DIDN'T AVOID IT. 

"Says more about you than me." 

YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW, LOOK GIVE HER A CALL, SOMETHING. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

"Yes, sir." 

BTW, I MISS THE DINOSAURS. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BRING THEM BACK. 

"Can do, my Lord."

ALRIGHT, GET OUT OF HERE. 

Bart leaves and goes back to his job. He sends a quick message to Lucy. Bart thinks about the platypus and laughs. He couldn't wait for them to become hyper intelligent and ravage the universe. Lucy would think that's funny. He sends a quick message and gets back to work.

Score: 436

"A cripple with superspeed!" Benny Madsen laughed, and looked around like he expected everyone to laugh along with him. Benny had superstrength, and looked it. He was a roided-out fucker at least a head taller than almost everyone else in school, and that included more than a few teachers. He was also profoundly tone-deaf, which if you ask me shouldn't count as a disability, but when have I ever been in charge of anything? And I admit, it was pretty funny watching his face go red when he tried to croak out the national anthem like a good patriotic American. 

I refrained from rolling my eyes and shifted uncomfortably on my crutches. My leg brace clacked against the ground, calling attention to itself. I'd managed to stay out of Benny's way so far, but I suppose I couldn't have kept it up forever. "Good one," I said. "I haven't heard that a hundred times already." 

Benny strutted up to me, lowering his head below his shoulders and making like the Hulk. "Must be pretty sad," he sneered, "being one of God's mistakes."

"We can't all be perfect," I said, and hummed the first few bars of the Star-Spangled Banner.

Benny scowled, and flicked a single finger. My right crutch was wrenched out of my grip, clattering twenty feet away. The force of the blow sent me toppling to the ground. I managed to catch myself on my hands, but the impact rattled through my legs anyway. "Fuck!" I lay there on the grass, wincing, as Benny loomed over me. 

"Not nice to make fun of people's disabilities," he said.

"Yeah," I said, and was gone. 

His eyes were barely tracking me as I crawled the twenty feet to my crutch, dragging the other behind me. Then I was on my feet, hobbling, and Benny was lost. I slipped behind him, unbuckled his belt, and pulled his pants down to his ankles. Then, while he was turning around, I did the old trick of tying his shoelaces together. That one was kind of a close call, but I managed it. 

I made my way back in front of him. My legs were throbbing and I was going to have a hell of a time explaining this to my parents, but it was worth it. Benny spun, his pants slipped down, and he collapsed right on his ass showing his tighty-whiteys. I made my painful way over to him, and he looked up at me, almost innocent, with this utterly baffled look on his face. 

"I can still hobble faster than you can run, motherfucker."

#### [WP] When I was 16 my father pulled me out of school and shoved me in the car. His eyes didn't leave the road as he threw a gun in my lap and said, "We're going to get your mother."

Score: 435

The car door slammed as I reached for the seatbelt. Frightened and confused, I obeyed my father and buckled into my seat. The windshield wipers swiped back and forth, mopping up the downpour as my father ran around to the driver's side of our family's SUV. 

"Hold this," he said as he threw a gun in my lap. "We're going to get your mother."

"Dad, what's going on?" I said. 

Without a word, my father sped out out of the parking lot of my high school and onto the main road leading to downtown. The gun felt heavy in my lap. I was too scared to hold it so I was squeezed it between my thighs. My palms began to sweat as I watched my father's eyes dart left and right as we weaved through the slow traffic yielding to the storm. 

"Dad," I repeated, "What's going on?" 

"Something's happened Nathan and we need to get your mother and get away from here," said my father. 

I had never seen my father act this way. I always thought of my father as the boring, middle aged government worker, who did nothing more than go to and from work, with the same briefcase for the last twenty years. Not today. Today he acted like he just woke from a twenty year long dream. 

"Nathan, he said, "I need you to listen very carefully at what I'm about to tell you."

I turned to my father and quickly made eye contact with him. Studying his eyes, I saw a different man. I nodded. 

"There's been an attack. We don't know who they are, but we know they released it downtown and it is quickly spreading. The symptoms are subtle, a common co--."

Before he could finish, our family's SUV became the bearer of a brunt impact that had run a red light. I clutched the dashboard and center console as we spun around in circles, finally coming to a dead stop in the middle of the intersection. 

Before we could assess the damage, my father grabbed my arm, "You ok?"

Filled with adrenaline and my heart pumping fast through my chest, I nodded again. 

"Son, we're going to have to move on foot, said my father, "grab the gun." 

Without hesitation, I clutched the gun in my hand, turned to my father and nodded once more.

This is bullshit.

What the fuck kind of God thinks this is a funny thing to do to someone? All I do all day is lie in bed and wish I was dead.

Super speed. I know what God's ability is. Super dick...hole...ness. 

"I brought you some milk, sweetheart," my kind, generous, loving mother said as she set the glass down on my bedside table.

"Fuck milk, Mom! I wanna' go outside and do things!"

"Well, I can get the wheelchair and bring you outside," she swooned.

"No! Not the wheelchair mom! I want to go outside without a wheelchair!"

I could see how much this was hurting her. I mean, we both knew that wasn't an option, but shit, I can't keep all this frustration bottled up inside, not even for the woman that gave me life.

But what kind of life is this to have? What kind of gift is it if all I get to do is look at my ceiling and pretend like I know what if feels like to jerk off? It's her fault I'm in this mess, for Christ's sake. 

She looked at her feet and said, "Well, is there anything I can bring you? Anything you'd like to do? You want a coloring book, or a movie?" I sighed, not to keen on berating my mother anymore, even though she's a bitch for giving birth to me.

"It's fine, Mom. I think I just wanna' sleep."

"Alright, well if you need anything, just call." Then she spun around and shut the door with the gentleness of an angel's whisper.

Fuck milk. Seriously. I want a Coke, but doctor's say I can't have any sugary drinks because they fear my super speed my give me super fast diabetes, so for this broken, young, degenerate it's milk, water and at Christmas, sugarless eggnog. 

Instead, I just did what I normally do. Grow my fingernails out with super speed, then chew on 'em. 

Except today was different. For some reason, as I clenched my teeth down on a freshly generated bit of nail material, the satisfaction of that snap didn't rush down my spine like it normally does. Instead it just tasted weird, like dirt. 

Great, now everything sucks.

But then I had an idea. It was a weird idea, a far-fetched idea, but if I could get it to work, it just might be worth it. 

I clenched my bed sheets in my hands and gritted my teeth, focusing all my energy inside my soul, deep down into the cavernous recesses of my brain. I started to shake, my face turned red, and veins on my forehead gained noticeable three-dimensionality.

I looked down. The hair on my arms was beginning to grow in full. My stomach started arching over my waistline. The skin on my limbs was growing increasingly white and washed out. What hair I had on my stomach grew out and began turning gray. I was doing it! It was working! Super speed my aging process!

All I could hope for is that I could age myself right into the grave, but as the energy was flowing through me, something else was going on in my head. I felt my entire life flashing before my eyes. People I'd never met, yet loved more than anyone on the planet. People I'd lost. Children I'd fostered. Pets I'd owned, jobs I'd worked, I saw it all. I saw myself stuck out of time in every situation I'd ever experience, all within the span of a few minutes. 

Then it began. A creeping, ominous feeling, like the lights were going out.

So I stopped. Look at me. A few moments before I was a shiny, young teenager. Now I laid in the same bed as a decrepit old man, scared and confused. After meeting all those faces, watching my kids grow up, seeing what my life had become, suddenly, I didn't want to die. Even if it was all from the perspective of a wheelchair, it was beautiful, visceral, it all made sense. This gift, it really was a gift. God had so much planned for me, an entire, beautiful life totally worth living. My mother going through so much pain just to bring me into this world of experience and beauty. I wanted so much to live it. 

But I already had. Time only goes in one direction. So before I age myself to death, let me tell you something. 

Never try to rush things. Life will come to you. Don't try to meet it halfway.

Also, our God is a rampant asshole for toying with us like this. Just like our mothers, who have the audacity to believe that any child they bring into this world will appreciate it.

Adios.

"Velkom to ze Hoodraulic Press Shannel. Today we are going to crushing this John. He is very annoying as you can see," the man said as I squirmed in the chair.

The scent of blood was trapped in my throat by the thick band of tape wrapped around my face. An opening scarcely more than a slit by my nose caused my breath to come in thin wheezes, further inhibited by the liquid caking the inside of my broken nose. 

Letting out a brief whimper, I heard him sigh again at the noise.

"You see chat I mean?" he addressed the invisible audience, "I think ve should get on and crush it."

*He couldn't be serious.* From somewhere above me, the machinery rose in pitch, a high whine cutting across the rumble of the motors, and I knew what was descending upon me.

At first first contact my hair was flattened against my head, the pressure then increasing on my scalp as my head was pushed downwards. The force increased and my chin collided my my chest, straining the muscles in my spine. 

I was hunched over further and the press continued downwards, forcing my chest into my knees and stretching my shoulders away from my hands which had been tied behind the chair. 

And still the push became stronger. 

I felt the first vertebrae pop somewhere in my lower back, directly below the column. Crying out in muffled agony, a ripple of cracks arched up my spine and my legs went numb as I felt my abdomen turn warm, a wet rush inside me as my pelvis compressed.

My legs splayed out to one side as I continued to scream, my entire body now on fire as my brain struggled to interpret the signals it was receiving. I tugged at myself and something slopped onto the floor below. Through the clouds I saw a pile of string sausages linked together. How odd for him to put something like that down there. *Why hadn't I noticed before?*

Huh. Odd how I feel hot and cold at the same time.

As the darkness gripped at me with fingers of ice, I heard him laughing along with the woman beside him.

INT. A RESEARCH FACILITY

*A young woman walks through a narrow corridor, carrying two steaming cups of coffee in her hands. This is CHEYENNE, a graduate student. She taps a plastic badge on a card-reader with her hip, then pushes her way into a small office.*

**CHEYENNE:** Hey, Frank? Are you around?    
**FRANK:** (*O.S.*) No! Go away!

*Cheyenne smiles to herself as she walks around a large filing cabinet. Behind it is a diminutive man sitting at a desk covered in print-outs.*

**CHEYENNE:** Well, darn. I guess I'll have to drink this coffee myself, then.

*Frank looks up at the white cups.*

**FRANK:** Oh, alright. Give it here, then.    
**CHEYENNE:** What are you working on?    
**FRANK:** It's another bloody send-back from the BODC. They claim our reports are invalid.    
**CHEYENNE:** Invalid? How? We're using their equipment!    
**FRANK:** That's not even the weirdest bit. Are you ready for this?

*A moment of tense silence passes.*

**FRANK:** (*CONT'D*) Well, are you?    
**CHEYENNE:** Oh, sorry, I thought you were being rhetorical.    
**FRANK:** I was, in fact, but I wouldn't mind your participation.    
**CHEYENNE:** (*Sighing*) Yes, Frank, I'm ready. What's up?

*Frank snatches a piece of paper from his desk and holds it out to Cheyenne.*

**FRANK:** Look at the forwards on this email.    
**CHEYENNE:** NASA? What the hell do they have to do with oceanography?    
**FRANK:** Probably something to do with the tides.    
**CHEYENNE:** "Tides?"    
**FRANK:** Well, I don't know, do I?!

*Cheyenne glances around the office.*

**CHEYENNE:** Why have you been printing out your emails, anyway?    
**FRANK:** Ah, that's the tricky bit. It seems as though our server has started erasing messages of its own accord.    
**CHEYENNE:** (*Skeptically*) Really.    
**FRANK:** Yes, really.    
**CHEYENNE:** Are you sure you didn't delete them by accident?    
**FRANK:** Quite sure, thank you... and what's more, everything that's missing had a reference to the same topic.

*Another moment of silence passes. Cheyenne sighs.*

**CHEYENNE:** What topic is that, Frank?    
**FRANK:** The Puerto Rico trench. I've checked, and the only records we've retained about the area have to do with volcanic activity. There's no other data.    
**CHEYENNE:** You make it sound like someone is clearing things out on purpose.    
**FRANK:** I'm rather convinced they are, actually... but lucky for us, I've kept hard copies of everything interesting.    
**CHEYENNE:** What constitutes "interesting?"

*Frank swivels around in his chair, scanning his immediate area. He points to a large scrapbook at the top of the filing cabinet, which Cheyenne retrieves. Frank opens the book and flips to one of the middle pages.*

**FRANK:** Right, here we are. These are images taken by a robotic submersible some three or four years back. They're nowhere in the database, even though there's a log number.

*He taps a small section of text on the page. Cheyenne leans in closer, squinting at the photographs.*

**CHEYENNE:** If I didn't know better, I'd say that looks like...    
**FRANK:** (*Interrupting*) Yes, well, it clearly isn't. It would have to be truly gargantuan, after all. Perhaps large enough to move the entire planet.    
**CHEYENNE:** The resemblance is rather striking, though.    
**FRANK:** Quite. That's why it was originally dubbed "The Engine." Not that you'll find any reference to it now, of course.

*A look of mild horror flashes across Cheyenne's face.*

**CHEYENNE:** Frank, do you have images like this for every ocean trench on Earth?    
**FRANK:** Somewhere around here, yeah. Why?    
**CHEYENNE:** Think about their locations relative to the planet.    
**FRANK:** ... I'm afraid I don't know what you're getting at, love.

*Cheyenne pantomimes holding a globe in her hands.*

**CHEYENNE:** If you wanted to pilot a planet-sized object, you'd need thrusters in specific locations, right?    
**FRANK:** Surely you're not suggesting that the Earth is some kind of colossal ship.

*The two stare at each other for a moment.*

**CHEYENNE:** No. No, that would be silly, wouldn't it?    
**FRANK:** Incredibly silly. Why, the very act of moving it would strip the atmosphere and kill everything on the surface. 

*He closes the book and shakes his head.*

**FRANK:** (*CONT'D*) I'll tell you, though, I'm going to reach out to some friends at NASA. If they're influencing the BODC, I want to know why.    
**CHEYENNE:** I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of things.    
**FRANK:** I will, as well. Maybe I'll find another engine, eh?

*Cheyenne smiles appreciatively, then moves to sit at her desk on the opposite side of the room. Neither she nor Frank notice the blinking red light in the vent above them.*

Some environmental terrorists managed to get ahold of one of the time warp portals and went back to fiddle with the 1950s. Somehow they managed to convince the U.S. Government that meat products were related to communism or something. I didn't have time to read the report very closely. The point is that everything is vegetarian now. Even the eggs are..." She sneered at the pile of yellow on my plate, "well, I don't exactly know what they are. Should be fixed by lunch though."

I sighed and bit into the bacon. It had the texture of rubber, and the taste wasn't too far off either. Damn time meddlers. Every day some other crazy group decides to go back and change things, thinking that maybe no one in the present will notice. It seems like I constantly wake up in the Third Reich when some stupid college kid builds a closet time machine and goes back to make Hitler a martyr or something. I could deal with a little soy bacon if that was going to be the worst of today's time corrections. 

"What are you plans for today, honey?" I asked, biting into my toast. At least strawberry jam was the same. 

"Paul has that field trip today for science class," she said. "Cretaceous period." She nodded over to the plastic suits in the corner that would pretty much immobilize our son while he was back in time. Wouldn't want someone stepping on the wrong little mammal or something like that. "The school is requiring twice the normal number of parents after the American Revolution incident." I rolled my eyes. Some punk in our daughter's class had decided that the lamp from Old North Church would make for a nice souvenir and had accidentally prevented America from ever existing. Boy, the Time Rectification Division had *not* been happy about that and even threatened to cancel all time trips for every student in the district. Luckily the History department had enough clout with the administration to make sure that didn't happen.

I checked my watch. "Well, hon, as much as I loved eating my blobs of soy," I grinned as she scowled at me, "I must be off to work." I grabbed my keys, gave her a kiss, and headed towards the door. 

She waved the morning time rectification report at me. "Take the I-16 instead of your normal route. It looks like..." she studied the screen a bit closer, "Wow, that's a doozy. Someone apparently went back to pre-Columbian America and formed an empire for themselves. The Rectification Division is still getting rid of the monumental statues where the highway used to be." I rolled my eyes. More megalomaniacs going back and playing god with advanced technology. 

I headed out to my car. Just as I reached for the door handle, everything began to shimmer in a time slip. "Oh, come on!" I growled, checking my watch again. With the traffic diversion, I was *already* going to be late. 

When everything solidified again, my gleaming new car was gone, replaced by what looked like an old steam-powered Model-T. "Great," I grumbled, sliding into the seat and trying to work the bellows enough to get this pile of junk moving. Yet another day where someone decides to fix global warming by preventing humans from every using fossil fuels. "Just fucking great."

The kid, whose baseball cap was on backwards like it was the middle of the nineties again, was holding  a bundle under his arm, wrapped up in a brown paper bag that was way too small to be a pizza. 

“Alright, I get it. I thought I was funny. It wasn't funny. I didn't actually want a block of cheese kid, it was a joke.”

“Thirty five.”

This time he held his hand out, the look on his face speaking volumes about how much he didn't want to deal with this shit right now. 

“Alright, alright, but thirty five is a little steep for cheese you know? What kind of cheese costs that much?” 

If I was being honest, I didn't buy cheese often enough to know first hand how much a block could cost. The only things in my fridge at that time were some condiments, a few bottles of light beer and leftovers from three weeks ago that I kept convincing myself would be fine to eat whenever I got around to it. Maybe I should have actually bought a pizza tonight instead of being a smart ass and loosing thirty five dollars for a damn block of cheese.  

Fishing my wallet out of my back pocket, I held out a fifty and raised a brow at the teen. “You got any change?”

Suddenly clutching the bag more closely now, his eyes narrowed and he shifted his feet, glancing out at the road as though to be sure nobody was there waiting for him. 

“No, you idiot, it's thirty five thousand, how new are you at this? Is this a fucking sting?”

“What the hell are you talking about? No cheese costs that much! It was a prank call, I never thought you guys would fill the order!”

“Wh—cheese? Wait, who the fuck places a prank call order for a kilo of coke?!”

His voice was hushed, but he was screaming as much as a person could hope to in the midst of whispering like this was some sort of dr--- What!?

“No, no way. That is not what I ordered. I did not order that. Is that what you have in the bag!? I ordered a cheese pizza with no crust!”

“Yeah!” the kid was hissing now, fingers clenching anxiously against the brown paper. “Exactly, and that's code for a kilo of coke. If I bring this back my boss is going to have my ass!”

Holding my hands up, I took a stride back into the house and shook my head. “Well I don't have that kind of money!”

A police cruiser rolled down the street, and I could only imagine that I looked like as much of a deer in the headlights as I thought I did, because the delivery driver grit his teeth and ground under his breath a stern. “Hand me the fifty bucks.” Operating on auto pilot, my eyes still locked none so subtly on the police car, I held out the hand that the bill was crumpled in and dropped the sweaty thing into his hand. 

Shoving the bag into my arms, the kid caught my eye and held it with an intensity I didn't even think possible on that pock ridden face. “Now,” he muttered. “I'll be back for the rest of that money in a week, so you better start getting real creative.”

As he jogged back to the beat up old Honda haphazardly parked at the end of the driveway, I somehow managed to shut the door behind him.

“Sir?” Snapped back to the present, I blinked at the travel agent in her smart pantsuit and wondered briefly if she took her job too seriously.  “Sir, you said Mexico is where you'd like to book a cruise to? Anything particular you're looking for from your trip?”

#### [WP] Christopher Robin (from Winnie the Pooh) and Calvin (from Calvin and Hobbes) Play in the same woods and go to the same school (different classes). One day they stumble across eachother and all hell breaks loose because they can see eachothers' stuffed animals.

Score: 380

"So the question is," said Calvin, "Why are we being asked to add and subtract when we've never been told why?"

"Turn left here," said Hobbes. Calvin turned right, and Hobbes groaned. The red wagon tipped over the hill and began picking up even more speed.

"How does math add meaning to our life?" Calvin continued, jerking the wagon handle to narrowly dodge a large tree. The wagon momentarily tipped onto two wheels. "Why aren't we being taught about ourselves? Why isn't our personal ontology being given any significance?"

"Turn right here," said Hobbes. Calvin turned left, and Hobbes groaned again.

"I believe that we shouldn't follow other people's advice unless they can give a very good reason."

"We've never been this way," said Hobbes. "We don't know what might be in front of..."

"And even then, we should stand up for ourselves," said Calvin. He let go of the wagon handle and smack his fist into the palm of his hand for emphasis.

"It's a cliff! Stop!" yelled Hobbes.

"We should be given the right to make our own mistakes. To go the road less traveled by--"

"Stop-stop-STOP!"

"--to learn the hard way. To--"

But Calvin never got a chance to finish his speech. For at that moment, the wagon tipped over a steep cliff, and kid and tiger and wagon flew into the air. Each arced through the air in a graceful fall and landed squarely in a prickly bush in the ravine below. 

"See," said Calvin, "if I had never ignored your advice, we would never have known not to come this way."

"What a success," grumbled Hobbes, sitting up gingerly. "I think I bruised my spine."

"I thought you said tigers always land on their feet," said Calvin as he brushed twigs out of his hair.

"We do," said Hobbes, "but it's impossible to land on your feet when you land on a thistle bush. Wait a minute--" 

"What?"

Hobbes got to his feet and looked around suspiciously. "Someone's been eating this recently." He pointed to a branch that seemed to have been bitten off.

"Huh," said Calvin. "Can you grab the wagon? I can't reach it without scratching myself."

"Get it yourself," snapped Hobbes. 


* * *

The two friends, dragging a red wagon with one bent wheel, made their way down the ravine in the afternoon light. Presently the walls of the ravine fell away and they found themselves in a section of the woods they had never been before. It was pleasant and green and thick with trees. Hobbes looked about curiously and sniffed.

"See," said Calvin. "Mistakes let you go places you never would have otherwise."

"Shut up," said Hobbes, rubbing his back. "What's this?"

There in front of them was a wooden door built into the bottom of tree. Above the doorway was written "Mr Sanders." Hobbes noticed that the last "s" was backwards. 

"Let's find out," said Calvin. He tried the door, and it swung open easily.

"Wait! You can't just walk in," said Hobbes. "What if somebody lives there?"

"Oh, don't be such a girl," said Calvin and dragged the reluctant tiger inside.

It looked as though someone did, in fact, live there. The floor was wood, comfortable-looking furniture was scattered about, and a pleasantly sweet smell filled the place. A clock on the wall pointed to 10:55, but it wasn't ticking.

"We shouldn't be here," said Hobbes nervously.

Before Calvin could answer there was a noise at the door. They both spun around to see a young boy standing at the doorway. He wore shorts and had messy brown hair that was longer than Calvin's. 

"What are you doing here?" frowned the boy. He had a funny accent.

"Hey," said Calvin. "Are you Mr. Sanders?"

"No. Mr. Sanders used to live here, but now my friend does. Are you burglars?"

"Just apologize and let's leave," said Hobbes.

"No, it's alright, as long as you didn't steal anything," said the boy. He turned to look at Hobbes and smiled.
Both Calvin and Hobbes jumped. People always ignored Hobbes. He was always very proud of this--humans are afraid of tigers (as they should be), and people ignore things they're scared of. But now, here was this boy, staring right at him. And smiling.

"You're friends with a tiger?" the boy said to Calvin. "I don't know anyone besides me who has animal friends."
Hobbes shook himself and stepped forward, extending his paw. "I'm Hobbes, and this is Calvin."

"I'm Christopher Robin," said the boy. "Do you want to play?"


* * *

If you were to go on a walk through the Hundred-Acre Wood that day, you might just have seen two young boys playing. But if you looked closely, you would realize that it wasn't just two boys--there were also animals: a quiet bear, a shy young pig, a tiny but enthusiastic kangaroo, two tigers, and many more. And if you really payed attention, you might have even seen an owl swoop silently overhead.

You would have seen a heffalump hunt and a baseball game. A game where it seemed like everyone was making up the rules as they went along, and another where everyone dropped sticks off of a bridge to see which one got to the other side faster. The bear who lived in the Mr Sanders house even recited several pieces of his own poetry. 


* * *


Finally, when it was getting dark, the brown-haired boy had to go home. One by one the other animals said goodbye and wandered off until just the blond-haired boy and the taller tiger remained. Calvin picked up the handle of his wagon and sighed. 

"Those were some strange people!" said Calvin.

"Nice though," said Hobbes.

"True," said Calvin. "And there was another tiger!"

"Hm," sniffed Hobbes. "I didn't much like him. He tackled me during CalvinBall. You don't know what it's liked to be flattened out of nowhere by a giggling orange blur."

Calvin snorted. 

"The bear was nice, though," continued Hobbes. "And dropping the sticks off the bridge was fun."

"Poohsticks, yeah, I guess," said Calvin. "But isn't it a little self-centered to name a game after yourself?"

Hobbes cleared his throat but didn't say anything. He looked around. "How do you suppose we get home from here?"

"No, no, we can't go home yet!" said Calvin. "Rosalyn will never find us here."

As the mother ship, 2000 meters long and covered with bulbuos spines, approached inner orbit, captain k'rac of the imperium of zel, conquerer of a hundred worlds and slayer of the crab nebula hordes, was signaled by one of the communications officers on the bridge.

"We are approaching our designated landing point, captan" clicked the prawn like navigator.

"Good" rumbled k'rac. "How long before we land on terra?"

"Approximately 20,000 flashes of a pulsar, " replied the officer, performing and double checking the minute calculations needed to breach orbit. 
"The swarm mother's larva have reported that the dominant species, known as "homo sapiens", are stupid and weak, only using crude ballistic and nuclear weapons".

"Wonderful!" chuckled (or as close to chuckling as a giant shrimp could) k'rac. "Agitate the hives, wake the dirgecallers, and prepare the photon mortars, this will be a slaughter!" As he began to leave the bridge and make his report to the monarch, k'rac turned back, as an afterthought struck him "Where does our first battle begin?"

"An island, uninhabitable by humans in the center and a good landing point, clicked the underling. "The dominant ape species here calls it..." 
the communications officer squinted at the hazy intercepted maps, taken from rogue satellites flung out of earths orbit;

Somewhere beneath the White House - in a basement that doubled as a bomb shelter - the President and his most trusted advisors met. He sat tapping his fingers against the table in agitation as the others argued.

"They may try to destroy us if we send them a sign of weakness," a general said. The Secretary of State and Vice President exchanged looks.

"Mr. President, are you bored?"

He turned his gaze to them with his eyebrows up. "I just don't know what kind of aliens they think they are. They aren't that smart. They aren't that great. Don't they know? America is a great country and they can't even get the numbers right."

"The...the numbers?" asked the Vice President. 

The President laughed. "Why, they say they want to be the *fifty-first* state. That's too funny. They obviously didn't learn their history well 'cause there are *already* fifty-one states." 

The room fell quiet. 

The secretary of state leaned over to the general. "Perhaps," he whispered, "it would be best if we play along, and come up with the real plan later."

#### [WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.

Score: 351

It all started twenty years ago, when a drug-fueled teenager with a temper came across a young boy sitting on a wheelchair, all by himself in a deserted park on a Sunday evening.

"What you doing out here by yourself?" I said, staggering over to him.

"Hi," he said. "Doc said I've got two days left, so mom's taking me around the neighborhood. You know, see some friends, say goodbyes."

"Where's your mom now?"

He looked like he wanted to shrug but his shoulders were too weak. "Dunno. Buying something from the store, I guess."

"Listen, man, you got any money?" I said. Without waiting for an answer, I began  undoing the clasp of his watch.

"Hey, what're you—don't take that! My dad gave me that!" He grabbed my wrist with a limp hand. Before I knew what I was doing, I punched him across the face.

"Don't touch me," I roared. "You're going to die anyway!"

"No," he said, only to be met by another punch. "Please—"

"Let go!" Our tugging led to him toppling from his wheelchair. In my blind rage, I began kicking him in the belly. He squealed, almost like a piglet, from each blow. His legs, which had been still the entire time, began to thrash as well.

Finally, pulling my arms free from his hands, I ran. I didn't even think about my actions then.

It was only two days later that I realized what I'd done just for a couple of beers. He would've been dead by now, but only because I'd killed him.

***

'cept the poor bastard didn't die. I only remembered because he appeared in the news, hale and hearty, standing proud beside his weeping mother. Every paper, every channel, was calling him a miracle.

Of course, back then I thought so too. Now, years later, I knew better. I stood before a wall in my room plastered with newspaper cuttings and magazine articles, of children who've been on the brink of death and lived. Men who've had limbs detached, only to regain them with little more trouble than simply sticking the parts back on. Women wasted away by disease, now out in the world doing great things.

All because of me.

I strode in front of the mirror and struck a pose: pecs trust out, hands on my hips, butt to the side. I've gone by so many names. The Man Who Punches Cancer. Germbeater. Hospital Crasher.

But most recently, I'd been officially given a designation by the city, after I saved more than sixty dying children at a care center.

I am the Bad Touch.

And it was time for me to go to work.

***

"Don't worry," I said to the parents standing by the bed. They always worried, for some reason. "This won't hurt a bit."

The mother bit her lips and nodded, allowing her husband to pull her back.

Their daughter lay before me, comatose. A horrible fall had broken something in her skull. Doctors couldn't do anything, which was where I came in. Well, I usually came in whether they wanted me to or not. Hospital Crasher. Good health before the whims of man.

"Here comes the bad touch!" I shouted, and slammed both fists into her chest.

She jerked awake with a cry. At once, the nearby doctors and nurses came running, along with security. I only had a bit of time before their hesitation to chase me away was overruled by protocol.

"Don't worry, dearie," I told the coughing girl, patting my biceps. "My slabs'll take care of you." With that, I threw a flurry of punches into her face, burying her in the folds of her pillow. Her mother sobbed behind me as her father comforted her.

Within minutes, it was over. She was dancing with her laughing and crying parents, and security guards were half-heartedly chasing me from the building. I ran with a spring in my steps, head held high. Another child saved. Death denied once more.

My next target was across town, at an old facility, requiring me to take a cab. This request had come in my email. Young boy, dying of cancer, paralyzed. The guards let me in without a word. Strange, usually they asked a ton of questions.

As a nurse led me to the third floor, I couldn't help but feel uneasy at the state of the place. It was rundown; filled with outdated equipment, grim-looking staff and few patients at all. Once, I even saw a rat slip out from a crack in the wall to dash among slippers.

"In here," she said, opening a door to a ward. Right after I walked in, she slammed the door behind me and locked it. I gave it no thought, however. A kid here needed my help.

He was sitting by the window, on a wheelchair, looking outside with dull eyes. His body was emaciated, and he didn't even turn his head when I knelt by his side.

"Son, you're a real champ," I told him quietly. "But you're in for a beating."

"I thought so too," said a voice behind me.

I spun around to face a young, clean-shaven man wearing an expensive-looking suit. He was smiling and fingering a tarnished watch on his wrist.

"Who're you?" I said.

He smiled even wider and gestured at the boy. "I'm not what's important right now. Doctors say he only has two days. Can I watch you work?"

"Two days is plenty," I said, standing up. "Answer my question."

"Don't you remember me? I used to sit in a chair like that, once. Until someone tried to rob me."

That watch ... the pieces clicked into place in my mind. "You? What're you doing here? What's all this?"

He shrugged and swept his hand around. "This dump? I own this place. You gave me a second chance, and I wasn't going to waste it."

"Emerson Care," he announced suddenly. "That's my name, by the way. I never got the chance to tell you. Or thank you."

My eyes went wide. "Emerson. Lucas Emerson? You're on the city's medical board. You own ... you own almost all the private hospitals here."

"And care centers, treatment centers, pharmacies, medical research labs ... the list goes on. You see, ever since you saved my life, I've been a tad ... interested in healthcare."

"Good to hear that," I said, preparing to flex my muscles. Corporate executives loved that.

He pursed his lips. "Yeah, not so great when someone's running around town healing everyone. Occupancy rate's shit these days. Profits are down, and I can barely keep the lights running in some of them. This place, for instance."

That sense of unease tripled. "Why have you brought me here?"

Lucas grinned, but his eyes were cold. "People don't need a miracle, Bad Touch. We aren't designed to live forever. When old age comes, people need beds, and rest, and medicine. I give them all that. I don't need a charlatan taking all that away from them. You're a false prophet. And I cannot allow you to keep doing what you do."

The door opened once more, and two men in suits came in. Both were huge and intimidating.

"Way I see it, you have a choice." Lucas pointed at the child behind us. "You can keep healing them. I'm not against that. I don't forget my roots. But you do it when I say you do. I don't lose all my profits; you get to keep some of them alive. Win-win."

"And if I refuse?" I said, fists clenched.

"Then we'll see if your own fists work on you." He snapped his fingers, and his men strode toward us. "But think fast. Consider your time window ... terminal."

#### [WP] A guy sells his soul to the devil, but the guy is the best lawyer in the world and manages to turn the deal around.

Score: 346

"Alright, there's one final stipulation before you sign the dotted line," said the lawyer, shuffling the paper on the desk. They were specialized, made from a substance that could not be burned, and the wood fiber ones typically erupted into flame after five to six minutes in Hell. 

"Which is?" Said an exasperated Devil, swishing his tail left and right with impatience. 

"That in the future, when I come to pay you my soul, I can exchange any soul considered to be greater than my own if I can bring them down to this room."

"Who gets to decide if they're greater?" Said the Devil, his eyes squinted in suspicion. 

"You do, you do of course. Think of it as a way to get more for your money. Now, I'm ready for you to sign."

The devil pulled out his pen, made from black obsidian, and the ink made from things far worse typically found within the human body. With a swishing signature he wrote his name, smoke curling up from the letters as the ink dried. 

"And here," said the lawyer, "And here. Here too."

Fifteen minutes later, and thirty seven signatures later, they were finished. The devil smiled, knowing it was now a waiting game. That for the cheap price of a billion dollars, the most beautiful woman in the state, and a successful career, he was now one soul up. 

All he had to do was wait for the man to die. 

***

Eighty six years passed. Humans now lived longer than they used to, meaning their debt took longer to pay, which was wreaking havoc in his soul finances and flow team. 

The knock came boldly before the lawyer stepped in, wrinkles crossing his face, a smoldering cane at his side. 

"Was it worth it?" Asked the Devil as the lawyer entered the room. 

"Indeed. I would say that is was."

"We'll see if you say that in a thousand years!" Replied the Devil, as he fetched a pair of glowing red handcuffs. 

"But wait!" Said the lawyer, "I've brought another soul to this room, like we agreed upon. One greater than I, and I demand a trade!"

"A trade?" Said the Devil, looking to the left and right, "But there is no one else here."

"But there is! *You* are here, and I'd like to trade my soul for yours!"

"Ridiculous," said the Devil, "I won't accept that."

"You have to.  You signed here," the lawyer pulled the packet from his briefcase, yellow sticky notes covering the pages, "It says I can trade my souls for any greater soul in this room. Unless, of course, you consider my soul to be more valuable that yours."

The Devil's jaw clenched as he sat in his chair, and the lawyer spoke again. 

"Well, is it?  Is mine more valuable?"

"No," hissed the devil through his pride, as the lawyer turned to leave. Before the door shut he called out to him, "You'll still burn in Hell! You didn't escape that!"

From the door the lawyer nodded with a smile. 

"I'm a lawyer. I expected no less, so this was the best deal I could get."

#### [WP] You are a hero with a strange power. Every time you raise your hand in a catching position, a voice yells a party nickname for you and a drink or drug tossed into your hand with impressive speed and accuracy. This is your epic.

Score: 343

It started at a party a while back.  Lots of people, loud music, hot, sweaty.  A good party.  I was dancing with this babe, seemed to making some progress with her.  There was a pause between the tunes and she asked if I would get her something to drink.  I was not about to leave her, so I looked over to where the beer cooler was, stuck my hand up and shouted "somebody beer me".

From somewhere I heard someone say "Bob-bay" and a beer hit my hand.  I was at a party, that's how it's supposed to go.  It handed it to her and I could tell beer wasn't really her drink.  Just then another song started.  It was one of my current favs and I shot my hand up in the air in appreciation.  "Bobster!" I heard over the tune, and a bottle hit my hand. Somehow I reflexively caught the bottle.  I looked at in surprise, and my dance partner took it with a thankful look in her eye.

That was the beginning.  It took me a little bit to "get" what was happening. I don't understand why it's happening, mind you, only the process.  I stick my hand up in the air, I heard a voice from somewhere shouting a variation on my name or some other nickname, and some type of "party substance" hits my open hand with amazing speed and accuracy, and I catch it every time.

It was fun at first.  I'm hot and thirsty?  Pow, beer.  I want to relax, a fat joint.  I want to party...you get the idea.  It's almost always appropriate to the situation I'm in or who I'm with. Its made me a very popular guy to be with too.  I could always get you something.

I just wish I could control it.  I had to stop raising my hand in class as my college professors found it disruptive.  I can't go to sporting events or concerts, or anywhere cheering might be involved as the constant incoming volley of cans or bottles or bags is difficult to deal with. Playing sports?  Forget about it.  

The worst though is what landed me where I am, in the hospital.  I was cruising down the street down by the beach. There was traffic and fair number of people.  I saw a buddy of mine and absently threw my hand up to wave at him as I called his name.  I big can of Foster's Lager hit my hand.  I caught of course, I always do.  I also lost my balance.  I mentioned the traffic right?

I came to while the paramedics were attending to me.  I was lying down, my right arm was broken, along with several other injuries. I was kinda out of it for a bit, but the horror my injuries were made evident in the hospital.  You see, because of the injury to my arm, and shoulder, and everything else, they needed to keep my arm immobilized.  And elevated.

Make it stop.  I can't take it any more.

Sir Ronald collapsed onto the cold stone floor. The statues of The Twelve gazed upon him, their faces cold to the knight's sorrow.

"What more do you want from me?" Ronald whispered, his voice cracking up. "I've slain the Beast of Darkness, I've saved the world from the flames of Azavar, I've returned the holy relics of Sir Veremur to their rightful place in your shrine. What more could you possibly ask of me? Why won't you accept me? When will my time finally come?"

The Twelve remained silent.

"For centuries I served you. I've seen so many of my friends and comrades pass on to your embrace. Am I really not worthy? Will I be destined to wander this land alone even when everyone else has fulfilled their purpose." Tears of pain and anger rolled down the old knight's scarred cheeks. "Is this my fate?"

The Twelve remained silent.

"Why? Why am I not worthy?" Sir Ronald jumped up to his feet, his voice echoing throughout the Great Temple. "I've done more than any other knight in the history of the Order! I deserve what is rightfully mine! How can you just stand there? Without me this world would be nothing, but dust and ash! Why do you ignore me?"

The Twelve remained silent.

"Answer me, pathetic fakes!"

Ronald felt his heart pounding in his ears. With his vision enveloped in a shroud of red, the knight gripped his sword and struck at the statue of the Allfather. A thundering crack resounded, as the marble cracked from the terrifying force of the blow. The pale head rolled off the statue's shoulders and shattered on the floor.

Ronald stared in disbelief at the dark blood pouring out of the cracked marble and creeping along towards his feet. Trembling, the knight made two steps back, horror gripping coldly at his heart. The red substance climbed the steel leggings, slowly enveloping Ronald. From the liquid he felt a warmth slowly building up into a roaring almost incinerating heat. It squeezed into every crack making it's way towards Ronald's body, surrounding him in a flowing burning veil.

The knight screamed in agony, feeling his flesh and bone being burned and rebuilt by the blood. Yet before long the pain ceased and only a sensation of newfound power remained. The sword in his hand ignited, painting the room with an ominous red light.

"So this is my fate?" Ronald asked, his voice unnaturally deep. "Then send your champions, gods, let's see who prevails."

Having said that, Ronald, who would later be known as the Godslayer, left the chapel, his laugh filling the halls.

#### [WP] You applied for a job at google, everything goes well and only one interview remains: They'd just like an explanation for your search history.

Score: 340

The knock on my door came like a blast of thunder. I jumped up in my armchair and looked at the time. Eight past midnight.

"Who's that?" I called. The armchair was so soft I didn't want to get up for no good reason.

"I'm Ms. Vernon from Google. We scheduled an interview today, remember?"

I groaned and shambled to the door. "You're six hours late. Can't you come back—"

The moment I unlocked the door, a pair of bulky robots burst inside and grabbed hold of my arms. Following them was a middle-aged woman all dressed in black.

"What're you doing to me? Let me go!" I shouted.

"Your interview has begun," she said sweetly. "I suggest that you watch your tone."

The robots dragged me to the living room and forced me into my armchair, while Ms. Vernon perched herself on the piano stool. When they were certain I wasn't going to try and run, the robots released my arms and stepped back.

"You can't just bring your private enforcers into my home," I said. "I have rights—"

"You signed your rights away in the job application contract, remember?" She waved a Google tablet before me, the offending document on display. "Along with your rights to sue for any bodily harm caused, so I suggest you behave yourself."

"I thought I was supposed to meet one of your top executives," I said. "Who are you?"

"I'm the special assistant to our COO," she said, swiping her fingers over the tablet. "But that's not for discussion. We're actually pretty impressed with your scores. Why, I'd say you're almost a prodigy, especially for a fifty-year-old man."

"Do you manhandle all your star applicants?"

"No," she said, voice cold. "Only the ones with a suspect search history."

I gulped; despite my earlier bravado and indignation, I knew I was in true danger now. Even as she slid her tablet across the coffee table to me, I was tensing up.

"Explain—" she said. "—why you don't have a search history."

My jaw worked soundlessly as I looked at the robots. Their red eye slits watched me impassively. Someone had turned the inside of my mouth into a desert. "I—I—"

"Nothing at all," she said. "Not a single search performed on Google in your entire life. How is that possible in the twenty-second century?"

I could only shake my head.

"We even checked the archives of Bing during the days before we bought Microsoft. Nothing from you. Where did you learn to code? How do you even use the Internet?"

"I don't," I said, face flushing. "I—I visit libraries. I borrow a lot of books—really, I can show you my study—"

"Pretend for one second that I'm an idiot," she said. "That I believe your horseshit about books. How do you remember everything you read? The primary needs of mankind are Google search and wifi, before even food. How do you survive without using a search engine?"

I licked my lips. "I go outside. A lot. I buy things from stores, I talk to professors, I borrow books. I can show—"

"Liar. You've done something to conceal your search history." She snapped her fingers, and the robots seized me again. "But Google knows. Google always knows. We'll find the truth."

"I'm not lying," I screamed. "I haven't even switched my computer on for a day!"

"You use your phone."

"I use my phone for calls!"

Her eyes widened. "You monster."

"I'm speaking the truth! Please, no, please ..." My pleas and tears went unanswered as they marched me out of the door.

All around us, my neighbors watched silently through the lens of their phones. No doubt they were using VideoGoogle to discover my crime. The only thing I'd ever wanted was to work at Google like my father before me. But the woman's eyes told me all I needed to know. I, the last of the Zuckerbergs, had just failed my entire line.

I can't stop staring at her. She is just *so* hot. Her pencil skirt is little more than a belt and she has dressed like that on purpose. Oh God help me, I shouldn't be looking, she is half my age. But I just can't stop staring.

*Damn, I am so thirsty. I bet that perv over by the bar would buy me a drink. He can't stop looking at me! He must be like, 40, and he's alone in a club. What a fucking loser. At his age he must have a bit of money though.*

What just happened... am I going insane? Did I pretend to hear her thoughts? Oh shit, she's coming over.

"Hey mister! You're pretty hot, for an older guy. Wanna buy me a drink?"

She is using me, I know it! I heard her thoughts. Can I do it again? Can I do *more?* I was just staring at her like this...

*God he is ugly. Two drinks and I am getting the fuck away from him. Wait, what the fuck am I doing... why am I leaning towards him, oh shit I'm going to kiss him!! HELP! OH GOD I CAN'T MOVE!*

*You think it's funny dressing like that? Tormenting men with those legs?*

*Oh Christ, how are you in my head? Please leave me alone mister! I'm only 15!*

*What am I doing...* 

"Leave the club and go home! Do not come back here until you are twenty one. Leave now or I will get inside you head and make you do far worse!"

How did I do that? I almost *made* her kiss me.  Good, she has run off. I would have hated myself for the rest of my life if I had even kissed her. My divorce was tough but this isn't the answer.

Those lads over there are laughing at me. I know it, I can see them turning their heads for a quick glance, then they turn back to their mates and laugh. They need to be taught a lesson. I'm going to take over the cocky looking one and have some fun.

*I'm glad that old guy is taking my mates attention away from me. I haven't smiled in a year. Not since mum died. I know my mates are totally fed up with me being such a downer, but man, I just hate my life. I hate myself.*

Oh shit, this poor kid... what's wrong with me. I have turned into a bitter and cynical old man.

*Hey, can you hear me?*

*Wh—who said that? Am I going mad?*

*No, you are not. I am a, um, an angel.*

*What?*

*I am an angel, and I am up here with your mum. She has a message for you.*

*M..mum?*

*Yeah. She says that she loves you, and that she is proud of you.*

*Oh God. Is this real? I'm crying in-front of my mates, I can't help it.*

*She says that it was OK to cry, but it's time that you found your smile again. She says you have a beautiful smile. She wants to see it again.*

*Please! Please tell my mum I love her and I miss her so, so much!*

*She already knows.*

*She does?*

*Yep, she knows. Listen, I have got to go. But remember what I said.*

Poor kid. Hope it gets easier for him. Hey, would you look at that, he's smiling.

#### [WP] Write a seemingly normal story, except for the last sentence, which makes the entire story creepy

Score: 334

They say parenthood is difficult, but my Charlie is an absolute angel! He stays perfectly quiet while I change him, never cried when I feed him his veggies, and loves going out! Just yesterday I took him for a ride in his stroller and he barely made a sound, he loves being outside so much.

Other people just don't understand parenthood. They recoil and act like they've never seen a baby, they gag and vomit as if they didn't shit their diapers too at that age. 

Little Charlie is the light of my life, but even he gets tired at the end of the day. So I put him in my car, through the driver's side of course. The passenger side still has a huge gash where that truck T boned me. I carefully buckle him in and drive him home, he needs his rest after all! 

I lovingly tuck him into his little bed, kiss his cracked forehead, close the lid, and begin to rebury my son.

#### [WP] You are a medieval knight that just ate a magic mushroom without knowing what would happen.

Score: 333

The battle raged around me as I choked on the mud with my dying breaths. I couldn't feel my legs; an enemy swordsman had raked his sword across my spine. I couldn't feel my left hand; it lay in front of my face, fingers curled up, like a dead spider. I couldn't see out of one eye; not with an arrow in it.

But I retained enough presence of mind to realize when someone stooped over me. An enemy, come to show mercy?

"You look like you need help," the man said gravely.

I tried to lift my head, to spit in his face for the insult, but my gaze made it no further than the hem of his cloak.

"Perhaps this will do." He held out a small, purple mushroom before my nose. Through the smell of blood, smoke and earth, I caught a scent of peppery sharpness. "Partake of this power, and rise once more, brave warrior."

Before I could resist, he grabbed my jaw and shoved the mushroom down my throat.

"But be warned," he said, rising once more. "If you do not have the strength, the darkness will not save you, but claim you as it has so many others."

"Let—it—try," I said. Then, I coughed up my liquefied insides all over his shoes and fainted.

***

Some time later, when the clash of steel had given way to the feasting songs of ravens, and the bellows of man turned to whimpers of pain and loss, I woke up on a field of fragrant, golden grass.

So unexpected was the sight that I leaped to my feet, only realizing a moment later that all the agony I'd been feeling had disappeared. Vigor surged through me, like the power of a thousand galloping horses, like the warmth of the summer sun. My detached hand began dancing in joy around me on fingertips, like a colt bounding around its mother. There were no ravens; tiny, winged unicorns flitted through the air, squeaking songs of romance.

"Look here, one of them's still alive."

I turned slowly to face the speaker. It was a giant of a man, seven feet tall, his brawny frame exposed in full, bare-chested glory. In fact, everyone there seemed to be built solely to make a nun question her life choices. Some were astride mighty capybara steeds. The capybaras had fur of every color imaginable, and they wore Ray-Bans.

The man hoisted a gigantic toothbrush in one hand. "Pick up your weapon," he said said. "I will not slay an unarmed man."

I was too busy studying my surroundings to answer him. The castle had become a construct of pink, wobbly jelly. On its walls stood enemy archers: fat, bearded babies dressed in red, with quivers of red-white candy canes. The brawny men had taken prisoners, beautiful women in bikinis who for some reason had very hairy thighs and rough voices.

"Fight me," the man shouted.

"Very well," I said. Bending low, I picked up a giant feather and held it at the ready.

With a roar, the man raised the toothbrush and charged, bristles rustling in the wind. I sidestepped his clumsy attack and tickled him across the back. Instantly, he deflated with a whizzing sound and went soaring away in the air.

The rest of his fellows began attacking, but I had the element of surprise. I plowed through them, turning dozens of these brawny fellows flat as paper and sending them on unwanted flights. The women began screaming my name and giving lewd suggestions as they flashed their breasts.

"I'm sorry," I said solemnly, taking cover behind a bread house as the archers let fly with their candy. "But I will have to swipe left for now."

Without their footmen and their cavalry and their capybaras (I felt bad about tickling them, they quoted Shakespeare before turning into handbags), the archers stood no chance. I cut them all down, turning them into piles of melted sugar that smelled strangely of Cuban cigars.

An hour later, I was the only combatant still standing in the castle yard. I wasn't the least bit tired, but the thought of spending quality time with all those women had me panting and drooling. But before I could make my way toward them, a thin man in a billowing cloak appeared next to me.

"It seems you've saved your kingdom," he said.

"You look like someone I've seen on Netflix," I said.

He patted me, almost sympathetically, on my stump. Noticing that the cut was now oozing with vanilla ice cream, I began slurping on it. For some reason, he winced when I offered it to him.

"I daresay the effects will wear off in an hour or so. If you survive, you'll be regretting this moment—"

Before he could finish, I punched him in the face. As he lay unconscious, I rummaged through his belongings until I found a small pouch filled with familiar looking mushrooms.

Without hesitating, I ate them all. I would make my kingdom great again.

"Fine haul today," the guard said, chuckling as he eyed the prisoner I was leading.

She was beautiful, with a creamy complexion, dark, doe eyes and rosy lips. The dress of sheer silk she wore seemed molded to her curves. Her wrists were bound together in front, causing her biceps to push out her already ample chest. No need to guess where the guard was looking.

"Careful with her, she's a witch. And a feisty one," I said, winking at her.

She pouted at me as the guard handed me a bag and said, "Don't know how you do it. Do you catch them when they're asleep or something?"

I jingled the bag's contents with a grin. "Interesting what can happen when you're in a bed. She's all yours."

"Come on, baby, let me off easy," the witch said. "Didn't I make you feel like you were in a dream?"

"See you when you get out," I said with a laugh. Giving her a final slap on the rump, I walked back the way I'd come.

We were miles underground, in the labyrinthine Hollows. Once the hidden fortress of a mighty kingdom, it had since been donated for use as a prison by the remaining members of the royal family. Now, only prison guards and their wards prowled the torch-lit caverns.

My breath misted the air as I climbed a sloping path toward one of the portals that led to the surface. Thinking back to the guard station earlier where I handed Theyenaa over, I wondered how they would treat her. Nothing harsh, I was sure. She had only been guilty of thieving, her victims usually silly but handsome men she had seduced into bed. Probably three days in a cell, three meals a day, and nothing more to endure than a few flirtatious remarks. The Wardens were unforgiving when it came to maltreatment of prisoners.

"I say, is that you, Virgil?"

The booming voice jarred me from my thoughts. I spun around to see the speaker peering at me from within a huge cavern to the side of the path. It was a red dragon, almost twenty feet long, lying curled up on a massive pile of gold coins. His scales gleamed with inner fire, and so did his eyes.

"Jonah?" I said, stepping closer to him. "Oh God, it's really you!"

The dragon snorted, beckoning me to join him with a clawed foot. "Been a while, old friend."

I shifted a small mound of jewelry aside to make some sitting space on the ground. "What're you doing here? Given up on arresting poaching dragonslayers?"

He sighed and turned his sinuous neck to look at the nubs on his back. Only then did I notice he was missing his wings.

"What happened?" I whispered.

"Ambush," he said. "It's all over for me."

"No, it's not," I said fiercely. "You still have your breath. Your claws, your sense of justice! You can't just sit here and mope about it. You can still do good!"

"You're one to talk," he said. His stare made me uncomfortable; it felt as though he was looking through me. "Why're you spending all your time down here? You're still alive. You should be out there."

I frowned. "I was on my way out when I met you. Dropped a prisoner off earlier."

"I don't mean the job. I mean your life." He fidgeted, causing coins to flow down the pile in mesmerizing streams. "I can't tell—er, listen, you need to get out of here."

"Now you're chasing me away?" I glared at him. "You were the one who called me here."

"Sorry," he mumbled.

"Well, if you're really sorry ..." I pointed at a massive golden crown at my feet. "Do you mind if I borrow this for a bit?"

He snorted. "Every time you 'borrow' something, I never get it back. Go ahead, but heed my advice," he said seriously. "None of this is real. Wealth—real wealth—is found in the real world."

"Right," I said, rolling the crown around in my hands. "Well, see you around."

Leaving the dragon in his room, I continued on the path, studying the crown. There was an old inscription carved on the inside.

"Let the Last King of the Watch wake the world from its nightmare," I read. Where did Jonah even find this thing? I had never heard of a 'King of the Watch'.

A turning ahead led to a tunnel, with cells on both sides. They were filled with shambling, rotting undead that gave off a strong smell of ammonia. Upon seeing me, they rushed to the bars, moaning, "Wake. Waaaaake."

"Shut up," I muttered. "I am awake."

"No, you're not," they said in unison.

"Shut up!" Their cries pursued me as I broke into a run. The portal wasn't far away. If I could get there, I would be back on the surface again, with plenty of coin to spend on women and music and good food. The good life was waiting to be lived.

The next area was large and open, and featured a tall stone construct in the middle. Between its two massive pillars shimmered the portal, looking like a rippling pond. But barring the way to it was a white, furry snake that made Jonah look like a tiny worm by comparison.

I gulped. It was one of the Wardens, an entity so old few alive knew its true name. It was watching me with three pairs of green eyes, flicking its three-forked tongue so powerful I could feel a mini-shockwave.

"Uh, hi, Warden Snake," I said.

"Enough games," it said. Rather, I heard the voice in my head; its mouth never opened. "You're only harming yourself."

"What do you mean?" I said, fighting to urge to retort impatiently.

"You don't belong here."

"I've been doing this for six months. I got my Arrestor license, fair and square. I passed training. Am I not doing a good job?"

"This prison is not meant for you," the snake said.

"I'm not a prisoner, I'm here on my own free will."

"You're being stubborn. You need to wake up and see reality."

Snarling, I said, "You don't get to tell me what to do, or where I should be! I choose to be here. I want to be here. I'm enjoying my life. I have money. The loveliest women I want. Respect, admiration, adoration! People want to be me."

The snake's head drooped a little as I continued shouting, "Look at me! I'm strong, healthy, I have abs for freaking sake. Do you think I want to be out there instead? Fat, stupid Virgil who can't even walk up stairs without panting? Sitting at a stupid desk, tapping away on a stupid keyboard with coffee stains left by its last user? Going home everyday to a wife who wouldn't speak to me, to kids who've replaced me with their phones?"

Tears crept out from the corners of my eyes. "I don't want the pain. If you know what really happened, then you should know—you should know I'm scared. I don't know how bad the crash was. Six months ... God, six months."

A long silence followed, punctuated only by my sobbing. And then the snake spoke, gently, "And yet ... nothing you described can compare to the pain felt by the people who love you."

Uncoiling itself, it slithered closer to me. "You could've thought up any other place throughout these six months. A beach. A palace. Your own island paradise. But no, you chose to work in a prison instead. I think you know why that is."

"I—I do?"

"Your services are no longer required, Arrestor," the snake said. Its eyes were suddenly glowing like suns, so brightly I had to shield my own. "Farewell."

The light grew—fierce, all-encompassing light—until my world turned to white.

And then, I heard a beeping sound.

It is said that on earth, when something breaks, everyone inexplicably becomes an expert.

Xlargok thought it was pure magic.

Just watching the creatures argue was a spectacle of its own, and Xlargok was glad he had brought his galacticom to translate it all.

"No, you gotta turn it *the other way*," a burly human was saying. "Here, give me the screwdriver-"

"I think it's not actually a screw," another human spoke up, eliciting deadpan stares from the other three humans. Perhaps, Xlargok considered, her mammary glands indicated a lack of the strange gift the other three humans seemed to possess.

"Naw, I reckon the crash must'a broken the glimmery bit loose, here, this part that's all beeping without sound somehow."

The burly man scratched his head, and gave the bit a *bang* with the screwdriver for good measure. Xlargok waved a tentacle in amazement. Somehow, the man had just banged on the hyperdrive *without blowing a good chunk out of their planet*. Truly amazing.

"So you were just driving by, eh, mister err...?" The third man held his thumbs underneath his suspenders and looked at the alien expectantly.

"**Xlargok**," Xlargok beamed the word into their minds using his mental gland.

"Right, right, xander. Fancy costume you got there. Don't worry, we'll fix up your car in no time."

"It's all the gadgets that he's put on it that's probably caused this in the first place," the burly man muttered, and the other two hummed their agreement.

"Isn't it that part there that looks even more odd than the rest?" The mammary human spoke up. "Honestly, I still think there's something very fishy about this whole-"

The other three shushed her. "Don't be rude now, Jane," the man with the suspenders said in a tone that Xlargok assumed entailed some local cultural significance.

The burly human turned to the lightspeed warp and gave it a good *bang*, and suddenly the control panel lit up again. Xlargok enthusiastically clapped his hands, all six of them.

"That did it," the man said triumphantly.

"Hey, you just hit the part that I told you was odd!" the mammary human said indignantly, but the other three ignored her.

"**Thank you, humans.**" Xlargok beamed at them, pleased with the adjustments. He got into the minimization room of his ship, kicking off the anti-gravity and soaring off.

The four humans stared at the sky for a while after he had disappeared, saying nothing.

"Strange fella," one of them concluded finally. "Must'a been from New York or sumthin'."

#### [WP] You finally meet up with with your online cosplaying group at a convention for the first time but you're starting to get the feeling that these guys aren't cosplaying.

Score: 323

“Could really use a beer right now,” Steve mused out loud as he pretended to eye the top of the convention hall, his moustach twitching. 

He twiddled with the hilt of his sword, causing his sword to swing wildly around his left leg. I noticed it seemed quite weighty for what was supposed to be just a prop, for his waistguard shifted visibly as he did so.

I had met up with this duo, Steve and Muni, outside Comic Con. We really hit it off over the net and shared an interest in cosplaying.  I was cosplaying a thief, Steve, a warrior, and Muni was dressed as a wizard. They insisted that we shouldn’t limit ourselves by cosplaying as a specific character from a franchise.

“Is that a hint? Is that what it is?” Muni asked. His eyes narrowed dangerously. 

“Well, I’m just saying…” Steve replied.

“Alright, fine. I don’t want to be accused of being stingy or hear comments about it *being free anyway*,” Muni resigned.

Muni adjusted his purple wizard hat, adorned with what I assumed to be random hieroglyphics, before holding out his left palm face-up. Right in front of my eyes, as his right index finger spiraled above it, a beer magically appeared. He handed Steve one, before making another one appear and passing it to me.

“Wha…!” I exclaimed. “What the hell was that? Was that magic?”

“Yeah, I’m pretty good at it,” Muni replied nonchalantly.

“Cool! Can you teach me?” I asked with the excitement of a young boy as a took a swig from the bottle. I was always a sucker for magic tricks.

“That… May be a little, uh, difficult,” Muni said. I got the feeling he wasn’t letting up on what he knew.

“Because…”

“Well, we, uh, can’t teach outsiders how to use – I mean - *do* magic tricks. My teacher forbids it,” Muni said.

“Okay… Nevermind then. Forget I asked,” I said. It really wasn’t that big a deal. I didn’t want to push my luck and be an annoyance to the group.

“Steve, your sword looks heavy. What material did you use for it?” I asked, eyeing his sword suspiciously. It *did* look too heavy to be a prop. It also seemed a little too sharp when he showed it to me before we entered the hall.

“I used metal for it. To give it, uh, a more realistic feel. Yeah,” he replied. The duo exchanged glances for a jiffy. I didn’t miss it.

"A what?" I asked.

"A scientist!"

I swallowed. "A what?"

He looked confused. In his defence, it was the exact same question I'd asked a second ago. "A scientist!"

"Yeah." I said. "Yeah..." There was a moment of awkward silence. "So..."

He turned to my adopted family and looked at them derisively. "You don't belong with them, wavin' wands and making dishes fly through the air when you need to wash up. You belong with us."

I brightened. "So how do we wash dishes?" I asked.

"Well..." he said. "With sponges. And arms."

"Arms?"

"Yeah. Our own arms. All... scrubbin' like."

I smiled encouragingly. "Right."

He shook his head. "This isn' about washing up, Henry. It's about changing the future!"

"The future!" I exclaimed. "How?"

He took my hand in his giant shoulder. "Through painstakin' research, my boy! Through arduous peer reviewed repeatable experimentation and constant academic scrutiny!"

"OK... What about the rest of my life? I'm on the Quidditch team!"

He shook his head. His hair followed, a moment later. "Quidditch is a game for those that rely on magic! We have football, Henry! Assuming you don't get knocked out too often. Or soccer! Where you can touch the ball five or six times an hour! Or athletics! Which yer clearly not cut out for. Do ye know what bowling is?"

I couldn't help glancing at my aunt and uncle. "No..." I said. "But anyway. Tell me more about this science. It's as fantastic as magic, right? I can make wondrous things happen?"

"Yes, my boy!" Higrod pulled me towards him and pointed out of the window at some imaginary future. "Although the road is not easy. You'll be challenged."

I squared my shoulders. "I can take it!" I said.

"Of course ye can. Challenges will face ye along the way. Through questioning yer methods and doubting yer assumptions. But ye'll persevere."

"Will I? And will people recognise my perseverence?"

He gave me a seesaw gesture. "Sure, there'll be bad journalism, distorting the views that you made very clear in your abstracts. Of course, there'll be internet pundits simplifying your views to absurdity. And you have to expect click-bait articles making promises on your behalf that are inconceivable within your lifetime. But if you stick with it, my boy..."

"Yes?" I asked, trembling with excitement.

He leaned in close. "Yer very own Google doodle."

I sagged. "Really?"

"Possibly on yer hundred and sixty eighth birthday."

"Right," I said.

"If ye're not dead by that point."

I nodded.

"Which ye will be."

"Yeah," I said. "I'm going to stick with magic."

"So you're still running the beta? I told you last week to patch it." James hated Mondays. He hated managing the engineers that spoke in long sentences full of acronyms. Mostly, he hated being stuck in this job with no way out.

"Yes," said the man across from him. He was fairly tall but his slouching and khakis that were a size too small made him look both taller and shorter at once.

"The stable release came out 10,000 years ago. And in all that time, you haven't upgraded it."

"Yes, sir, we were preparing the update for today, but an issue came up."

"Well, I'm sure that upgrading will solve your issues." James had never had an issue on his computer solved by upgrading, but surely there was a first time for everything.

"We'd have to reboot," the engineer offered.

"So reboot!"

"We...we believe that some of the simulants have begun developing rudimentary sentience. It would...remove them."

Suddenly, James felt like he was on much firmer ground. After all, he had aced his intro to philosophy class.
"No no no. They were designed to give the illusion of sentience Michael, but they can't actually think. They just simulate having a sophisticated calculator made of matter in their heads. No one could possibly *think* using matter. The idea is ridiculous. Imagine if you had to *think* using a piece of nerve fiber. You might as well think using an apple."

"Hrm, yes, well you see, that's the problem. We've...uh...The other day." Michael stopped for a minute. "I've talked to one."

James had never quite got the hang of Mondays.

"You've...talked to one? Did you bang together some pieces of air until their tiny little nerves could hear you?" James joked.

"Uh, no sir. If we adjusted the algorithm that calculated the air movement it..."

"How did you talk to it?"

"One of the patches in the release candidate was to patch a buffer overflow error that allowed for execution of arbitrary commands on the program."

There was a long, awkward pause. The tall man coughed. James gave him a stare that he hoped conveyed the message that he needed a better explanation without having to admit he didn't know what the problem was.

"It left a message for us on the server." There was another long pause. "It...she...saw the update being scheduled. She realized what it would mean and asked us not to do it."

James let his head fall into his cupped hands. "Michael. I need you to speak slowly and in very small words and tell me exactly what happened."

Michael took a deep breath. "We've known about some bugs in the program for a very long time. They've always had medicine men, witches, saints, people that learned somehow where a bug was, how to exploit it. They never knew how or why it worked, just that it did. But, someone has gone much further. She can use crystals...quartz I think... to poke a hole in the system. She can use the administrator screen."

There was a moment of silence.

"Look. The higher-ups said that they wanted to see the system patched last week. Hell, they wanted it patched 10,000 years ago. You patch it today or you're fired and I'll find someone who can."

"Yes, sir." Michael walked quietly out of the room.

James leaned back in his chair and took a sip of coffee. There was a secret to dealing with engineers. He might be getting the hang of this after all.

#### [WP] At the age of 10 you're given the option to go through surgery to possibly get superpowers 10 years after that. The surgery leaves you basically crippled during that time. All your friends and family are getting their abilities meanwhile you just turned 21.

Score: 321

My friends had opted for the surgery too. We had made a pact to go through it together but they had developed their powers over a year ago. Meanwhile I waste my days still stuck in a wheelchair, still breathing through a tube and now watching them all outside; flying and fighting and having fun. They practice to become *heroes*.

Today I look out of the window onto a grey sky. A single ray of light creeps through a crack in the clouds to glare blindingly in my eyes. I am taunted even by the heavens. I try to move my head to escape the beam, but I am unable to shift a single inch. Instead, I shut my eyes and block out the world.

---

The years have passed and my friends no longer visit. They are too busy now. I despise them for leaving me here to rot. Everyday is grey. I no longer look out of the window but instead keep the curtains drawn. The light can no longer torment me.

The nurse enters my room uninvited. A fat thing with huge drooping breasts and a sarcastic face.

"Hello! How are you doing today?" she asks, knowing full well that I cannot respond.

"It's a lovely day outside! Shall I open the curtains and let the light in?"

*NO!* I scream silently, desperately, **NO!**

She pulls back the thick fabric and releases the light. It dances gleefully around the small room. It reflects off  my metal wheelchair and into my eyes. I am enraged. If only I could move. The hate pulses through my head, through my veins and through my heart."

"Are you OK Xavier? You look quite il—*gghhhh!*"

I squeeze her neck. Not with my hands but with my hatred. It is like watching a chicken having it's neck wrung. 

She slowly turns red, then blue. Then limp.

If I could smile I would. Instead, I channel my hate into my chair and slowly move out of the room. I will one day find my *friends*, but now I must prepare.

#### [WP] You're underage and trying to use a fake ID to buy booze. Suddenly, someone walks into the liquor store and recognizes you...as your fake persona.

Score: 319

"So, this is you.... you are Michael?" the clerk asked, although it was more of an accusation, we both knew.

"Yes..." I trailed off, maintaining eye contact. My right shoulder twitched mutinously.

In my life I have had some particularly cringe-worthy moments, but now I had plumbed the depths for a new personal low. Using my recently deceased older brother's ID to try and buy beer felt like less of a tribute to him now than it had sounded in my head an hour ago.

As I looked into the clerk's eyes I detected a distinct glint of resolve, and I could tell this was about to end very, very poorly for me. I inventoried my options in an instant, and in my mind I decided the best option would be to insist I was my brother. My body determined the best line of action would be to cry, wet myself, and beg him not to call the cops however, and was a heartbeat from moving unilaterally for plan B.

"Michael!?" Cried a woman from behind me.

I turned around and recognized Tanya

My brother had always been an unstoppable force of willpower. He was my hero growing up. He performed well in school, was an all-star athlete, and always had the eye of the ladies. I would say that his Achilles heel was his hero complex (with which I was thankfully not likewise afflicted). 

He always wanted to save everyone. 

Tanya was his Everest. 

She had been Michael's girlfriend for almost all of high school and college, and must have taken Michael's successes as a personal challenge; the challenge being to see how much she could hold him back. She pushed for him to go to a local college rather than where he had his full ride, demanded he not attend parties at college in mixed company, and imposed other petty, insecure restrictions on him that I most certainly would not have endured, in addition to her otherwise insane histrionics. It had been around five years since I had last seen her and a couple years since my brother had finally broken up with her while over seas on his final deployment. When I had heard about the breakup I had been ecstatic.

Currently, her face was lit up with surprise and joy.

I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach.

"Oh, hi Tanya, how's it going?" I inquired dismissively, already turning around to try and make a speed record of the end of my purchase. The clerk, while still eyeing me suspiciously, was now ringing up my items.

"How is it going? How is it GO-ING?" She demanded while storming inexorably forward. It was clear that the surprise had worn off, and her face no longer displayed any joy either.

If I had any common sense I would have grabbed the next closest person in line for use as a human shield. She was on me in an instant.

"Here I am at home, WITH YOUR SON that you refuse to hear about, and you don't bother to tell me you are in town!?" She raged.

I felt like I had been punched in the face. I was never an uncle, was I? It had been so long since I had seen her and Mike had never mentioned a pregnancy... I felt sick. We hadn't talked much in the months before he was killed but I felt like this is something he definitely would have told me about, wouldn't he?

The clerk no longer held a look of consternation, and had instead opted to much more expeditiously ring me up, while paying much closer attention to the items on hand.

"We waited for years, YEARS, for you to see the light and come back, you piece of shit. Leaving us alone, without even your military benefits because you were too CHICKENSHIT to get married!" she roared, making accusatory chopping gestures in my direction for emphasis.

I had no idea what to say. I turned around again to the cashier who was now pushing my items at me and demanding money in a demeanor that was vaguely reminiscent of a how a robber in a stickup might.

"Don't you turn away from me!" She yelled. "You and I have a lot to talk about."

I grabbed the two six packs and headed for the door. I felt a burning shame and confusion roiling inside me, but I knew there was no way I could let her malign my brother like that. Pieces were falling into place, and the picture they were creating of Mike was not flattering. I just wanted to go home and digest, preferably with a healthy dose of beer.

"I joined the Army to escape you, you evil bitch. You only ever held me back." I choked out, with my hands full of six packs. I moved for the door and only looked back once as I hustled through it.

I almost made it to my car before she got to the parking lot.

"Donny." She yelled.

My name stopped me with my door still open. I placed the beers down on the driver seat slowly. She closed the gap on my car with a couple quick strides, dropping the angry pretense.

Now it was my turn. The confused and upset feeling was giving way to rage building up inside me like pressure in a pressure cooker.

"You knew ... you really ARE an evil bitch." I intoned matter-of-factly. "You know who I am and you put me through that right after my brother died? You know Mike died right? But seriously, there is no kid? You guys broke up years ago..."

"Hold on." She said dismissively, waiving away my words. She came in close, then reached into my car and pulled out one of the six packs.

"No, the kid isn't his, and yes, I know he is dead. This is the tax for getting you through that shitstorm you were brewing in line. And for not telling your mom, dickhead."

"I can see why he left you." I said angrily, letting rage get the better of me.

She looked me up and down with a calculating look, then turned to walk off with my beer leaving me with just a single six pack and a final quip.

"I can see why you wish you were him."

#### [WP] After a freak accident, you've split into two versions of yourself. One good, the other evil. For some reason you two are able to cooperate quite easily.

Score: 313

"It's not quite what I thought it would be," I say. I reach out and touch the face of this other half of me. It looks just like me. Like staring in some sort of twisted mirror where I move and the mirror doesn't. Like getting really high and feeling like having an out of body experience but instead of staring at *myself* myself I'm staring at...

Well, I guess I'll call her Pa. 

A voice booms down at us from an intercom somewhere. It's a live voice, not the prerecorded kind that plays on commercials. It's a voice that I know we can talk back to - a real human sitting somewhere near enough to see us but not very near at all. Some paradox of far-but-not-far, an observer who can watch and tell me what I'm seeing and why I'm seeing it but who is unable to feel the strange sensation of dissociation and rapidly infusing morphine-induced euphoria. "Separation complete. Meet yourselves, girls." 

"Did you know that this was going to happen?" Pa looks scared. She must be the good twin. Which makes me the evil one. Except I don't feel very evil. I don't feel like I want to go around burning things or killing people, or even hurting this strange mirror image of myself that does not mirror me. I do not look scared. I force the muscles of my face to move so that I do not look scared, rearranging each facet of my face like a piece of some puzzle until I am but a blank experimental page for the far-but-not-far owner of the voice to watch. 

Pa blinks at me. I haven't answered her question. I don't plan to. She walks to the door and peers out of it, standing on her tiptoes and coming back. She sits down on the floor. She is a constant stream of motion. With every move she makes I force a bit of cement into my muscles - consciously imagining that lactic acid is filling my body from the bottom to the top, simultaneously freezing and releasing me from the need to be able to move. I am frozen - call it too much pot again - paralyzed from the high that is allowing me to see the strange hallucinations that are before me. 

This isn't a hallucination. I know it's not. She is the good twin and I am the evil. 

"They can't do this to us," Pa is saying. She's sitting on the floor again, cross-legged, looking up at me like she should have pigtails instead of the long straight hair that hangs about her shoulders. She - I - sort of look like this manifestation of Asian-meets-Aryan, some thing that was molded from clay by a God and then throw out into the trash with that sound - *pah!* 

"Please talk to me," Pa is standing now. Her hands are on my shoulders. She's pushing me. Somehow this contact breaks me, like I'm a glass of water and she's dipped her finger in and pressed so lightly yet just right on the surface and broken the tension and broken through to me. I almost fall into her. 

"I'm here," the words echo in the room and do not seem to come from my mouth but they are not the words of the far-but-not-far intercom woman. Pa is sitting, saying *we need to get out of here* and I agree. 

"Why did they do this to us?" Pa is asking all of the questions that I feel I should be asking and thinking. She is the speaker and I am the thinker, apparently. Speak kind words, think the truth I suppose. It occurs to me that she is looking at me again. I wonder if there are as many thoughts in her head as there are words in my mouth. 

"We need to get out of here," I'm just repeating her words now. Parroting them. A sick mirror of *her* now, but delayed by a few moments. A playback. A choral round, beginning to sing just as she's two syllables in, our tongues and teeth moving just the same but at different intervals. 

"Pa!" Pa shouts. It occurs to me that to Pa *I* must be Pa, and *she* must be I. It is a very confusing situation. I think of the intercom and the woman's voice and the fact that she is far-but-not-far and watching us but not close enough to be in this room with us. 

"I'm here," it's my voice. 

"We need to get out of here." 

Third time's the charm. "How do we get out? The door is locked. I remember - we remember. Being drugged. Being dragged here. The experiments. The torture." 

"It's horrible," Pa's voice is small. As if on cue the door to the room buzzes and opens on its own. I imagine the far-but-not-far woman sitting in her chair with her feet up on the table as she sips a soda, *slllllllllrp hrphrphrphrp* and watches two parts of the same girl argue. It occurs to me that this might be their plan - to release us and see what we'll do. 

"We should go," Pa, the talker, is talking. I look at her and nod. I am tired of talking and I would rather think. I think of destroying the people who did this to me. That settles in my mind that I must be the evil twin. There are worse things to be, but it occurs to me that I'll never have my own narrative. No one ever follows the narrative of the evil twin. I am thinking of how I will spend the rest of my life being misunderstood and misinterpreted by people who look solely for good. I am thinking this way when Pa wanders out the door and looks back at me and says, "Come on, Pa!" and I once again remember that in her mind - if she has a mind - *she* is I and *I* am her. 

I follow her out. The hall is dusky. I want to ask Pa if she feels the same heaviness and dizziness. The sort of dizziness that comes from waking up in the middle of a dream that seemed too much like reality. Pa is over by the window of another door now and looking in and her mouth is slack. I go to join her, the dizziness trying to pull me down like strings tied to synapses inside my brain, little tugging pulls that remind me of looking into a flashing lightbulb and the bright red dots that continue to swim after I blink, threatening to run each time I look directly at them. Pa is looking into a room and there's a man that's strapped to a table in the room, looking directly at us but not *at* us. 

When I stand back I see the little sign on the door, the three triangles that come together and make me sick. That sign isn't on our door - the door we just came from - but it is strangely reminiscent of some other door. Pa looks at me and I look at Pa - we're having the same thought, except she says her out loud to me and I think it but don't say it. That we were in that same room with those same three triangles, except maybe it was before *we* were *we* back when *we* was *I*.

"They're making superheroes," Pa is taking the words from my brain. But we can't both be superheroes. Not if one of us is good and one of us is evil. That's what they told us they were doing, back when *us* was *me* and I had the same ability to speak and think and I wasn't overwhelmed by just one process. Pa is speaking aloud everything now - the triangles and the superheroes and how one of us is good and evil, though she doesn't mention which she thinks she is maybe to spare my feelings on the matter, though my feelings feel fairly stoic and non-emotional about the whole thing anyway. I'm too busy trying to call back the feeling of being too high that all of this might be some dream from a drug trip far before. 

"Pa," Pa waves her hand in front of my face like I haven't been looking at her the entire time. Her hand has those after waves, those fuzzy lights that follow, little imprints of her hand burned into my eyes. Suddenly my head hurts. Everything is coming back - memories of screaming. Of torture. Of green IVs and yellow triangles and of becoming me and her. 

"Pa," Pa says again. "Pa. Don't you see what they're doing here?" I want to say that of course I do. Of course I see. Instead I clench my hands tightly together and shut my eyes to make the pounding stop. I raise my fist and I hit it against the wall and I feel the wall crumble underneath me. I think of the man in the room with the three triangles strapped down to the table with his IV full of glowing liquid and the screams and if he will be an *us* soon, as well. I know exactly what they're doing. I know exactly what they plan to do. 

"We won't let them," Pa is saying. She's taking my hand. Her hand. They are perfectly aligned, copies of a hand that should not exist. Like cupping my fingers together, sliding my own fingers up my wrist and grasping. Pa is putting her arms around me and I'm letting her even though the anger is building inside of me. But unlike what they wanted my anger is not at her. She is me and I is she. She is good and I am not. I won't be what they want me to be. Not to her.

"We'll do it together," she's saying. She's squeezing my hand. 

I wonder idly if there is room in the world for two superheroes who are at the same time exactly the same, and at the same time completely different.

#### [WP] You are a hero with a strange power. Every time you raise your hand in a catching position, a voice yells a party nickname for you and a drink or drug tossed into your hand with impressive speed and accuracy. This is your epic.

Score: 312

My theory is that it's magic. I don't know how, I don't know why. But hey, free beer.

Let me start over. My name is Michael. Mike to my friends, and I have no idea what I'll be the next time I put my hand up. I am a superhero. I think, at least. I certainly have a super power, but it only became useful during college. I'm a senior now, so I'd like to focus on my classes, but I don't know how to turn it off. But you have to believe me, because trust me, it gets awesome in a second.

So, here goes. When I raise my hand, like if I'm moving to catch something, someone yells a nickname for me, something like "COWBOY MIKE!" (I own no cowboy hats or cowboy gear of any kind, so I have no clue where that came from), and then a drink is thrown into my hand with the speed and accuracy of an MLB fastball. It is unreal how fast it goes. The drink varies too, even to drinks that one definitely does not throw. I accidentally raised my hand in chem lab once and caught an appletini, salt and everything. It even had one of those little umbrellas.

It's made me pretty famous around campus, and I even once had a TV crew interview me. I don't think I'll exactly be asked to join Overwatch anytime soon, since they have all have actually useful superpowers, like that superspeed girl with the two pistols. But hey, it's not awful being a minor celebrity. But here's where it gets cool.

So we had a supervillain attack the campus. Like, an honest to god supervillain. He called himself Ferryman, and he was trying to goad Overwatch into a fight by taking hostages. No one wanted to mess with the dude holding two shotguns and seemingly able to produce more from nowhere (probably his superpower, maybe a variation of mine but actually useful), so he managed to take the student center hostage. Of course, since I was stupid, I had my headphones in, and I walked into the student center somehow. And there he was, black robes and all.

I was hung-over at the time, and not really in a mood to deal with anything. It hadn't really made it through my skull that I was facing down a legit supervillain, so I pulled a trick I had mastered during freshman year. I turned around, raised my hand so it lined up with his mask. The voice yelled "THE MAN, THE MIKE, THE LEGEND", and I dropped my hand right as I saw the drink. Ferryman got clocked right in the face with a loaded can of PBR.

I guess it was more the surprise of it than any real injury, but he was out cold. Just to make sure, I kicked him in the head a few times. Of course, my luck being as it is, Overwatch rolled up right at that moment, to see me, Michael Ferris, standing over the prone form of a supervillain. The exchange had been caught both on security cameras and several phone cameras.

I received an official commendation from Overwatch "for my heroic actions in the face of grave danger". I got to shake the hand of Strike Commander John Marion, which was probably the coolest part of the whole thing. I also got someone's number. I think it was that Egyptian sniper chick, since she introduced herself as Amara when I texted her. I didn't know Overwatch recruited 21 year olds, but apparently they do. We're getting drinks in about 15 minutes, so I gotta go.

Moral of the story, kids, even if your superpower is useless, you might get lucky. Keep at it, learn the ins and outs, maybe you'll get somewhere. Like me.

I recommended the management be put to death since a steady supply of prisoners seem to escape weekly but my requests go unanswered. So I carry out the orders of the Prophet to keep this chest safe from the unrelenting, lone escapees although I wish it was a challenge.

"My car is so hot that I could cook an egg on the dashboard. Look! Do you see the egg? Oh, tell us what to do wise and powerful one." 

The man standing on the stage gave a half wave. "Hey there," he said into the microphone. "Uh, have you ever thought of putting a screen up to keep the sun out of your car? It might help with the heat."

There was a murmur that spread through the crowd. The man at the microphone shifted wearily from foot to foot. 

"So how does it work?" the woman asked from her pew. 

"Just put the screen up over your dashboard when you go out to the grocery store or shopping or you want to relax at home. When you come back your car will be...I don't know...fifty degrees cooler?" 

The murmur swept through the crowd again. Outside the man knew there were protestors and picketers. 

He had arrived three days prior with no memory of how he had ended up in this strange place. People had immediately taken to him, tilting their heads and whispering to each other as he stood up and dusted off his hands. He walked around the town for a bit, going from person to person introducing himself and asking for directions to the nearest hotel and hey - had anyone seen his wallet?

"I have a question!" A man near the back stood up on his pew. "My pillow grows bright red in the middle of the night and heats up my face until it steams! What do you recommend I do?"

"Um," the man said. "I don't know. Get a new pillow? Do you sleep over your heating vent? Maybe you need to get a more breathable material like cotton?"

"Cotton!" the man shouted in response. "I never thought of cotton!"

His popularity had grown in the first twenty four hours. People had come to meet him and shake his hand. They had begun to ask him for help with their problems once they realized that he could - quote un-quote - do *anything*. The man had spent his days hammering nails into the wall and helping pick out new blackout curtains and even doing laundry for some people. He was perplexed as to why they needed the help, but he figured a good deed was a good deed. 

"I spilled cheese on my wedding dress!" a woman near the front screamed. "Please, help me. Please!"

"Maybe you could find a stain remover? I mean really you could use anything. You could probably use club soda and baking powder. Comes down to it the dress is already on the verge of ruin so you might as well just use bleach--"

"Savior!" the woman shouted. "Savior!" 

The chant started from a low rumble and then grew bigger, until the entire auditorium was chanting. *Billy, Billy, Billy.*

Billy made his way down the aisles, gently waving and shaking hands with everyone. "Hi. Hi. Oh, hi. Nice to see you again. Yes, hi. Hi."

"Greet us like you did when you first came down from the sky!" A young boy shouted.

"Oh," Billy laughed. "Um. Hi, I'm Billy Mays."

The boy broke into a beam. Billy made his way into the hall and leaned his back against the closed door. He took in a deep breath. It was a lot to take on, all of the worship and suddenly being called everyone's savior.

He shook his head to clear it. He could do this. He could be the person that the town needed him to be. All he needed to do was build up his confidence a bit. To proudly proclaim to the world what they needed for each and every problem in their life. He could make it quick and easy and fun for the people to listen to. And as for the people who were afraid of him. Hopefully with time they would adjust.

He had only wanted to help people.

Two weeks later, he stood on the stage again. There were tremendous roars from the audience. "Hi, Billy Mays here! I'm here to talk to you all about my new formula Oxiclean. It whitens, it brightens! It's mother nature approved! It works on food stains, pet stains, drain stains, stane stains.It cleans, it brightens, it eliminates odors, and it's mother nature approved!" 

The crowd erupted into another chant. Billy Mays smiled.

He was finally helping the world.

"I'm sorry to bring you here like this."

"Not at all, my dear boy. Not at all."

"But, you see, I have to know… I have to know, and you're the only one –"

"I get it," the old man interrupted me. He puffed his cheeks weakly, like it took him great effort just to breathe, 
and then he leaned back against the armchair and his eyes turned to the crackling of the fireplace. "Ask away."

"Well… it's pretty simple, actually." I leaned forward. "What's it like?"

His eyes turned to me, and he almost smiled. *"What's it like?"*

"Yeah. Life. Growing up. Being old." I paused. "Well, not that I'm calling you old, I just –"

"It's okay, dear boy," he laughed. "I am old. That's why you brought me here."

I said nothing. He arranged himself on the armchair like he had all the time in the world. Then his eyes went up to 
me again. "It's… hard."

I waited. I knew he wasn't done.

"It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, actually" he continued. "Harder than building all this fancy equipment you've built. Harder than studying all you've studied. Harder than winning all these scientific awards you've won so far." He chuckled. "Nothing prepares you for it."

"What makes it hard?" I asked. "Is it the responsibilities? The body decaying? What makes growing up so hard?"

"No. It's not the responsibilities. Growing up is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane." He lowered his head as if to put his thoughts together, then continued. "It's the things you don't expect that catch you by surprise. Sure, it's scary to have a kid, and to get married, and to ask your boss for a promotion, and all these grown-up stuff we have to *pretend* we know how to do."

"Pretend?"

He seemed surprised. "Yes, pretend. No one really grows up, of course. We put on a face to the world, but at home, three in the morning, all alone watching TV, you're still sixteen. All of us are." He shook his head. "There's nothing more heartbreaking than being a real person and sitting down in front of another real person, and then both of you have to act like fake people. You sit across from someone two years older than you in a job interview and you both say 'Hello, sir' and 'Yes, I also think the Dow Jones has been fluctuating dangerously this last few days' and 'Oh, absolutely, the 405 is a nightmare this time of day'. And all along you *know* you both laugh at poop jokes and fart sounds and you have all these hobbies and interests and you curse and say fuck and shit and asshole. You're real people. But you act like robots. You have to put on the face, and they have to put on a face, and you have to pretend that nothing in life is ever fun, everything is productivity and seriousness."

"Is that what makes it hard?" I asked. "That everyone's just… faking their way through adulthood?"

"No. No, that's expected. It sucks, but we all know what we're getting into." He sighed. "No, what catches you by 
surprise are the little things about growing up. It's being stuck in traffic and remembering a day. Any day. A locker 
room conversation in high school. A teacher. A friend of a friend. Something that happened long enough ago that 
it could order its own drink. It sneaks up on you, and you look at yourself in the rear view and you think, my 
God… where did it go? When did I become so old?

"I remember college like it was yesterday. I remember my girlfriends and my friends and they used to drink and 
talk about sex and hanging out and now they all eat oatmeal and go to funerals. And I do that to, and I *like* all of that. Well, not going to funerals, but oatmeal. Soap operas. Going to bed at nine. I like it."

"So what's the problem?"

"The problem is I'm still the sixteen year old. I'm still the college kid. My needs and wants have changed, and my 
body has changed, and my mind has changed, in a way, but *I* didn't change. I'm still putting on a face. So when 
these thoughts sneak up on me – when a flash of a college party or a roadtrip or the feeling of falling asleep in the 
back of my Dad's car wells up on me… it breaks me. It breaks me because I don't think of it fondly. I don't look at 
that young kid with affection and nostalgia, I look at him with envy. Envy, because he's got all of that ahead of him 
still, and he doesn't even know how lucky he is. He's me, we're the same – but he's got the good looks and the 
health and all the years ahead of him, and I'm wasting away in an old apartment. And I hate that kid so much. Every time he sneaks up on me I hate him more."

I looked down, then up. "What about family? Kids?"

"They are great. They are amazing. But they go away. They're not *you*. In the end, you raise your sons and 
daughters for the world, not for yourself. They have to fall asleep in the back of *my* car, and go to *their* college parties and all that… they don't exist for my benefit. No one exists for my benefit but myself. And I'm much too old to do anything about it."

I swallowed dry and averted my eyes to the fireplace. The old man leaned forward. "We always get the feeling that 
the good old days are either behind us or ahead of us. They're never our own days. We were always born just a 
bit too late to go to Woodstock or to see Nirvana live or to see the Berlin Wall fall or to party Great Gatsby style in the 20's. And then we get old and we realize we were born too soon to see the wonders of technology and the world reshaping and blooming into something new and exciting. But the truth is, our Woodstocks were happening all around us as we grew. Our new and exciting world was some old guy's boring present, and our past will be some spoiled, arrogant kid's 'Good old days'. We were just too stupid to realize it when it mattered. So we let it slide away. And then we ended up like me – sad and resentful of our younger selves for all they can still do and we can't."

Finally, I got up. I went to the old man and I knelt in front of him. "I'm sorry I brought you over."

"It's okay," he said. "I knew you would. After all, I did it, sixty years ago."

I looked at my own eyes. Despite the wrinkles around them, they still looked pretty much the same. The old man 
shook his head and sniffed a tear away. "Now let's go back to your lab so you can send me back to my own time, 
so I can hate you in peace."

I hugged my own eighty year old version and leaned away and nodded. "I'll enjoy it," I said. "And I'll know I'm living in the good old days, I promise."

He got up with difficulty. "No, you won't," he said. "The good old days are only ever good when they're gone. That's what makes them good. When you're living through them, they're just... days."

He slow-stepped ahead of me towards the lab. Then he spoke without turning his head: "And days go by really fast, man. They go by really fast."

#### [WP] You have the ability to reverse time by 6 hours whenever you're about to die. You're currently on a 10 hour flight on a plane that's about to crash.

Score: 3557

I was back in my seat, around six hours before the accident, watching the in-flight entertainment, and wondering how something like a plane crash could become so boring so quickly.

The plane loses an engine, all the warning lights start to go off, the plane tilts down, a smell of smoke, and I'm back here. Every time.

This is at least the ninth time I've looped, and after going through most of the good in-flight movies, I was down to the slim pickings when I had an idea.

I go back whenever I'm about to die...right?

The knife from the airline food packet would have to do. Most of the passengers were asleep at this point, so nobody noticed as I plunged the plastic blade into my chest.

Six hours ago. In the terminal. Waiting. 

It worked. **It worked**.

My head was spinning with possibilities, and I still had the knife. There was only one option.

Six hour ago. In bed, asleep before the Five AM flight.

Six hours ago. I was watching TV.

Six hours ago.

Stab. Stab. Stab Stab Stab Stab...

It's at least 2010.

I think I've de-aged, but my memories are intact. I've still got the knife. I don't know what to do.

I can predict the future. A real life psychic. I can mold my life to be the best one possible. Killing people just to see what happens, then going back and doing it again. Stock markets, speculation, investments, unexplored possibilities revisited, old loves rekindled-

But that was for later. For now, I had only one question. How far back could I go?

I readied the plastic knife, and started all over again.

Stab. Stab. Stab.

#### [WP] A man orders a "cheese pizza with no crust" from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine.

Score: 3221

At the sound of the doorbell, I heaved myself from my seat. 

I moved over to the door, ready to go on an angry rant about the time. Who the hell thought two in the morning was a good time to turn up at your house? They could’ve woken me up! They didn’t, but they could’ve, and it’s the thought that counts.

I opened the door and my words died on my lips. A man in a pizza deliveryman’s costume stood there, smoking a cigarette and flanked by two burly men in tracksuits. Behind them, a bright red SUV was parked, its lights off but engine still gently running.

“Uh…hi?”

The pizza man dropped his cigarette. “Show us the money first.”

I glanced around. “Am…am I being robbed?”

The man snorted. “Robbed? Hell no. We’ve got the best prices around.”

I looked at the symbol on the man’s hat and came to a sudden realisation. “You’re from Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour!”

“Hell yeah, I am. Now where’s the money?”

“I called you guys six hours ago.” Prank-called them, to be specific, asking for a ridiculous order. Come to think of it, I hadn’t even given them my address.

The pizza man snorted. “What, you thought we were gonna come in broad daylight? And people don’t normally ask for such massive amounts.”

“I only asked for a cheese pizza with no crust.”

“Man, what do you mean ‘only’? It would take years to get through a cheese pizza without the crust. What do you normally buy?”

I rolled my eyes. “A Hawaiian pizza with no cheese or pineapple.”

The pizza man’s eyes widened. “Holy shit, dude. Are you some kind of millionaire?” He turned back to one of the men. “This guy’s a real buyer; go get the product.”

The man nodded and headed back to the SUV. He rooted around in it for a minute before turning the lights on, revealing a myriad of logos for Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour that I somehow hadn’t seen before.

He returned soon, clutching a briefcase, which he handed to the pizza man, who laid it on the floor and clicked it open, revealing a pristine pizza box. Slowly and carefully, he stood, and then handed it to me.

“It’s all in there, dude.”

What the hell were these guys on about? I opened the box.

 “Guys, I didn’t order a box of flour.”

#### [WP] Everyone is born with a disability and an ability. A test is done at birth to determine these, if they aren't already apparent. You, well, you were born with crippled legs and have the power of super speed.

Score: 3014

See, what most people don't realise about super speed is that it doesn't just affect your legs. Your entire body moves fast. People never tend to get that because you see guys like Ravel Alton sprinting at three hundred kilometres an hour down the speedway. I mean, it's more impressive *visually* than what I can do... but I like to think that my abilities are still pretty good.

"Checkmate," I smile, knocking over the white king with my own rook. Valentin, my opponent, stares at me in shock. By the look on his face, my guess is that his ability was mind-reading. It's a good way to become a chess champion, I'll give him that. 

But he can't keep up with me.

See, from the femtosecond his finger touched the first piece, I started running through the possible moves in my head. All of them. 

Do you know how many possible positions there are after each player moves three times? More than 9 million. That goes up to 288 billion after four moves each. But when you can't move without a wheelchair, and when you have a brain that can scan and memorise information faster than anything else on the planet... and when you also have a lot of time on your hands... you can memorise everything. Every perfect game. 

Not to mention, of course... Valentin might be able to read minds. But he can't process information as fast as I can. Which leaves him unable to comprehend the million, million, million thoughts I have every nanosecond.

I can't run. But that doesn't mean I'm not *fast*.

#### [WP] You're a 12 year-old in a world domintated by magic. A small, feeble man appears on your doorstep claiming: "You're a scientist, Henry"

Score: 2360

Henry and Roy shuffled into the cafeteria along with the other forty first year students who would be starting at the East Brighton Preparatory Academy. The other students, already seated at the tables, barely looked up from their meals. It didn't look much like the Great Hall of Hogwarts that he had seen in Mum and Dad'said photos. Instead of a thousand floating candles and a stormy sky, Henry just saw dirty ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights. And there were no long wooden tables with silver platters of food, but instead scuffed red plastic tags and dented aluminum trays heaped with something that almost looked like macaroni and cheese.

"This must be the Sorting!" Henry whispered eagerly to Roy. "My father told me all about it!" He searched the room for any noticeable banners to see what the different houses were, but he couldn't see any. No matter; the muggle's version of the Sorting Hat would surely explain it. 

"Sorting?" Roy grunted. "Sorting *what*?" He was muggle born, after all, so of course he wouldn't know how it was done at Hogwarts.

*Do the muggles not do sorting?* Henry wondered. That didn't make sense. Haggard had even brought him to a Muggle library so that he could learn a bit more about his school before the first day; they'd used a machine that Haggard had called an "internet." There, he saw pictures of mascots and all the bright colors, just like the Gryffindor lion. And while they were at the Muggle's version of Diagon Alley (Called "Shopping Mall,") Haggard had explained that all the boys would be split up to live in different areas of the school. There had to be a sorting, right?

"You know," Henry tried to explain, "Like, where they split us all up and decide what house we're going to live in."

"Ohhhh." Roy nodded understandingly. "Yeah, 'at's what *this* is for." The young girl in front of Roy turned right then and passed a stack of papers to him. They weren't the yellowish parchament that Henry was used to; just plain white squares covered in black writing. Roy took one for himself and then passed the stack to Henry. 

Henry studied the options, each with a little blank check box next to it:

> Windsor Building, Dorm A

> Windsor Building, Dorm B

> Churchill Building, Dorm A

> Churchill Building, Dorm B

"Errr...." Henry wasn't sure if this was right. Where was the Hat to make the decision? "You just pick one?"

"Yeah," Roy answered, seeming a bit confused. "Wotchu think, Henry? Want to room together?

"Sure!" He didn't have to stop and think about it. Regardless of what House they chose together, it would be good to be with a friend.

"Well, my brother Doug was in Churchill B 'is first year," Roy explained. A roguish grin spread across his face. "'e said that it's got a pretty good view into the girls dormitory across the quad! I say we grab that one!" The girl in front of Roy turned around and shot daggers at him along with a look of disgust. She was likely trying to figure out which dorm was *not* across from Churchill B.

Henry looked back down at the paper. "Well... what attributes does House Churchill fit best? Because I think that I'm fairly studious and intelligent, but my *father*'s house was known for being brave and those things tend to run in the family." He frowned; this really would be easier if there was just a hat to the decision.

Roy's face screwed up in confusion. "Henry, you're a weird bloke. What the hell are you talking about?"

"You know..." This was so frustrating! Henry'd never had to deal with Muggles before. "Isn't our house supposed to match our personality?"

Roy laughed. "It's just a place to live, Henry. It'll be a bunk bed and a desk with a little lamp on it. Probably broken, if what my brothers all told me is true. That's about it."

"Oh." Henry looked down at his paper. "I guess Churchill B will be fine then." He looked around for someone passing out feathers to write with, but there were none. Just some little orange sticks topped with what looked like bubblegum. Roy took one and pressed it against his paper, and it made a mark in the box, so Henry copied him. Just like that, it was done. That was the muggle version of sorting. 

Roy and Henry turned in their forms and were shepherded into a different line. They were given trays and walked past a counter with a glass sneeze shield. A frumpy old woman ladled heaps of orange goo onto their trays from a big metal bin that was indeed labeled "macaroni and cheese." Henry couldn't see a single noodle in there. Then they found their way to tables and sat in no particular order; Henry didn't even know who the other members of Churchill B were yet.

"So this is the feast?" Henry asked, poking at his goo. Roy had already devoured half of his portion. 

"Yep!" Roy said. "But don't get used to it. My brothers said the food gets worse after the first night. They're trying to make a good impression and whatnot." He followed that sentence by shoveling another forkful into his mouth. 

Henry looked down at his orange blob. He decided he didn't like being a scientist very much.

#### [WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.

Score: 2317

Before me stretched an impossibly long hallway. Big, imposing, steel bulkhead doors lined the concrete walls. Sickly lights that were evenly spaced along the hallway provided illumination. Everything was in a state of decay. The lights flickered on and off. The steel doors were rusted and some of the tiles on the floor were missing. Bloodcurdling screams could be heard all around you along with twisted laughter and grotesque fapping. It was hard to think in all of this noise.

Satan lead me down the hallway. He had a smug grin plastered on his face and it hadn't changed once since I first met him. The demon was completely red. His entire body was completely red. He was also naked. I didn't dare to ask why.

There were little circular windows on the bulkhead doors. In one room I saw an emaciated old man surrounded by food. Cakes, freshly cooked meat, ripe fruit and glistening wine. It all looked like something right out of a commercial. The man was trying to shove as much food in his face as possible, only to gag and hurl it back out.

In another room there was a woman covered in bloody red eyes. She tore at them with her fingers, screaming as she did so. In yet another, a teenage girl was being surrounded by six little toddlers. Each of them were eyeless, skinless little things that poked at her with hot iron pokers. There seemed to be thousands of these little rooms.

Satan put one burning red hand on my shoulder and guided me onwards. He grinned smuggily. His smug levels seemed to have increased tenfold. I tried to ignore what was poking me in the thigh. Satan led me to a door that looked like all the rest.

"Well, sport! This one's yours. I know it might be a bit hot in the summer, but atleast you don't have to worry about heating bills!", Satan grinned smugly. He pointed finger pistols at me. I stared at Satan. A man behind me screamed as he was being flayed alive. 

Satan shoved me into my personal cell. "Enjoy enternal damnation, Mrs. Pierce!", he said as he disappeared with a poof. The bulkhead closed on it's own and I was faced with my worst nightmares.

Snakes. Thousands of them. They were a piled up on eachother. When I entered the room, they all hissed to greet me. One particularly large cobra was as thick as a tree and as long as seven men. The cobra rose to face level and hissed at me. I slowly raised my fist.

And booped it. On the nose. So many sneks and an enternity to boop them all. My face lit up with a smile. I hugged the cobra, cradling it in my arms. I never noticed how Satan called me Mrs. Pierce. Too many sneks. 

. . . M E A N W H I L E . . .

In front of Mrs. Rachel Pierce was a large football field. The bulkhead door spun shut behind her. The sky was blue, the birds were chirping. Handsome, sweaty football players tackled eachother on the field. When they noticed her, they passed the football to her. She jumped and caught it with both hands, clutching it to her chest. 

"Oi! You weak-legged cunt! Come join us for a game!", the incredibly buff football player yelled at Mrs. Pierce.

And yes, Mrs. Pierce's legs were particularly weak in this moment. This was her fetish. This was like, all of her fetishes.

She let out a small "Yesss!", before joining them with a smile on her face.

Dan always had the coolest parents.  He could do whatever he wanted and they never seemed to care.  Most of the time they weren't around.  When they were they just told us to have those microwave meals and "take care of ourselves" like we were adults too.  My mom never let me have those microwave meals, she said they were bad for you, and she was always nagging me to do my homework.  Not like Dan's parents, we could do whatever we wanted there.

I remember when we would make pretend armies and wage war for control of the Carpet Kingdom.  The cans were our infantry, the small bottles were the cavalry and the bigger bottles were the artillery.  We would have huge armies and fight over the whole house, from one end of the carpet to the other.

Today his parents had let him set up a swing in their house.  He had attached one end of the rope to a light fixture and the other end kept his feet dangling off the ground.  I gave him a push and he swung back and forth.  "When do I get to go?" I asked.  He didn't say anything, but he never said much.  I couldn't wait for my turn.

Score: 2057

*Chris this, Chris that. Chris, you're so cool. Chris, let me help you with that. I'm sick of this shit.*

Chris Mayer, the freshmen who just joined high school, was loved by everyone immediately. The girls, the guys, the jocks, the losers- everyone wanted to be his friend. Me? It was my senior year. 

One day, I was eating lunch in a bathroom stall and just grew sick of it all. Sick of the unfair bullshit, the way people were nice to him but hated me. It was just because of his cancer, I knew it damn well. Worst of all was the way he smiled at me, or waved and said hi to me like nothing was wrong. It was him I hated most. 

June 19th: the day I graduated from high school. My uncle was there, but no other family, and certainly no friends. Yet there that little bastard was, IV rack in hand, cheering and clapping for the senior class. Someone dedicated a speech to him. Everyone gathered around him after the ceremony. My uncle left halfway through, before I even got on stage. 

I left before the midnight party began, just after sunset. Since my uncle had abandoned me, I was forced to take a bus stop that was almost a mile away. I took a shortcut through a side alleyway to the building our graduation had been held in, where I found Chris bent over and retching violently.

"Oh, dear," he said weakly, forcing a small laugh. "I came here so no one would see me like this. It's pretty bad these days."

No words formed in my mind; there was only an animalistic rage swirling, mudding my thoughts. I pummeled the living shit out of that frail, little boy. Every punch was vindication, every tooth knocked loose a symbol for my shattered dignity. Soon I was just taking out all my angers on him; my family, my loneliness, my uselessness. He was an emotional punching bag I'd made literal.

By the time I stopped, it was too late. Fuck, there was so much blood on me and the road, and his twisted little body. And yet, through labored breaths, through broken bones and missing teeth, he tried to smile. He tried to say something to me as well, but the blood pooling in his throat left the words inaudible before he started choking. 

I ran. I didn't call for help, I just ran. No one caught me, somehow, and he died that night in a hospital bed. Not from the cancer eating away at him, but from my fists. I cried the whole night, and couldn't sleep for three days because every time I closed my eyes, I saw his mangled little face trying to smile. That whole time, it was *me* I hated, not him. 

That night, I went home and punched myself in the face as hard as I could. I wanted to give myself a taste of what I'd given the poor boy in his last few hours, to feel what he felt, but no matter how many times I hit my face... I felt nothing. I checked a mirror to see if I'd just broken myself, but I looked sharper than ever.

Ever since then, I've haven't been able to hurt someone with a punch. In fact...I heal them, like my hands are imbued with the life I stole from him. Hands I'm afraid of, because I know he's haunting me.

I don't know how...

...but I wish they'd worked that way on the day I graduated.

"This seems kind of weird," Kendra was sitting in a reclining leather chair. Behind her were several people in long judge costumes complete with powdered wigs. "I don't know anything about the worth of someone's life or where they should go."

"Never had a religion or a code of ethics?" one of the judges raised an eyebrow. Kendra couldn't really tell them apart, but there was only one that spoke. 

"Not that I remember," Kendra began to play with the hem of her dress. "But a lot of it is blank. I don't...I don't *think* I did."

"That's ok," the judge waved his hand. "Sometimes we just like to get outside opinions."

Kendra thought there was something seemingly off about this, but couldn't put her finger quite on what. She swallowed as the chair turned back around and she looked up at the screen. 

It was like watching life through someone's eyes. There were little snippets of action - the world opening up like a flower in bloom and seeing two faces looking down at her. A man in a mask and a woman who held her close. 

There was the sound of crying and babbling. A muffled argument late at night while a mobile spun lazily above her head. The sound of a woman singing and the surprising feel of a hand in hers. 

Kendra jumped, pulling her hand from the armrest into her lap. Behind her there came laughter. "Don't be alarmed," the voice of the judge. "This will feel quite real at times."

Slowly the world began to shift from horizontal to vertical. Trees that had seemed massive began to shrink. There was a man's face that peered down at her with disappointment. A sharp pain across her face and around her upper arm. A whisper that wound its way into her ear. *Don't you ever tell a soul.*

A young child that sneered at her and taunted her with cries of *chicken legs* and *freak*. The running of a sink and hearing sniffling sounds that reached her own ears. 

Smiling faces. Angry faces. Faces filled with disgust. The feel of her own greasy hair as she dragged a trash bag full of things to school. The pity in teachers' faces. *Poor girl. Parents just can't keep it together.*

A small dark space. A sniffling cry. A begging to be let out that poured from her own mouth. The sound of a key and the smell of mothballs. The twisting of a doorknob and a tray of food shoved inside. 

"Please," her voice begged. "Please!"

A man who held her hand and told her it would be alright. The embarrassment of finding red between her legs in the middle of a science class. The chilly inside of a car on a winter's morning as she pulled a sweater tight around herself for warmth. 

Sitting on the side of the road with an empty cup. Looking at the faces of those disgusted with her. Walking into a store and shoving her pockets full of things. Her own hand brandishing a knife at a woman on the street. 

A bridge at night. A whooshing wind. A splash of ice. 

The picture faded. Kendra sat still and raised her hand to her face to find it wet. The chair spun again until she again faced the men in black. 

"So what do you think?"

Kendra started. "What do I think? I don't know. I think it's horrible. But I don't know if it's good or bad. Just sad. And the ending..."

"You feel sympathy for her?"

"Of course. Only pain and suffering could drive her to an end like that."

"What about her sins?" The man gave a wry smile. "What about the theft? The sloth? The knife?"

"I feel nothing but sympathy and sadness for her," Kendra said. 

"Do you think you could forgive her?"

"Forgive her? What has she done to me?"

"Could you forgive your mother for leading such a life? Your best friend? Your child? For taking the easy way out?"

"She suffered so." Kendra paused. "Of course. I just wish there was another option. To try again. I wish I could hold her hand and tell her it wasn't her fault. I wish I could give her happiness."

"What about yourself?"

Slowly the memories bloomed in Kendra's mind. She sat stunned as they flooded back. Her eyes began to sting and her throat began to tighten. "That was...that was..."

"Can you show yourself the same kindness and forgiveness you would show to someone else? Can you allow yourself to see the pain and desperation that *you* felt without the judgement or the self hatred?"

Kendra stared at them and said nothing. It felt as though someone had reached into her chest to squeeze her heart. 

The judge smiled. "Ah yes. It's much easier to see our pain when we see it through someone else's eyes. Why don't you try again? See if you can show yourself more kindness."

The judge reached out to push a button. Then, as though she had been pulled into a vacuum, the world went black.

#### [WP] The entire Star Wars series, all 7 movies, are released as one book, written by Dr. Seuss.

Score: 1896

A long time ago, and so far far away,

There was a rebellion in space, so they say!

That old Evil Empire was up to no good

They kidnapped a princess, you knew that they would!

And then with the might only money can buy,

They set out to make a Death Star, in the sky!

That dastardly Emperor!

That Scoundrel! That Fiend!

Could nobody stop him? Would no one intervene? 


But the princess was crafty - and with luck she escaped! 

SHE wasn't held back by a bit of a scrape!

Though she didn't get far, she did get far enough

And she sent out a droid with a message - times were rough!

Though she knew that her plan had no chance of success,

It was all she could do - A New Hope, for the rest


And as luck would have it, her plans met with a teen

They flew all the way down to the planet, Tatooine! 

When Luke picked them up, he had no way to tell

That this was the start of his personal hell


He went to a master - a man named Old Ben

And in fear for his family, he went home again!

But when he arrived, he found they all died

So with nothing to hold him, to the stars he did fly!


Soon they met with a smuggler, a man named Solo

He said he could take them where they had to go!

But while flying along on their journey to space

Old Obi Wan feels something - pain across his face!

"I sense a disturbance" He said with no doubt

"As if hundreds of people had suddenly cried out

And then they were silent - I do not like this" 

Luke looked on in horror, he knew something's amiss

"Wait, that's no moon! It's a space station!" he said with a hiss!


Before they knew it, and before they could react

They were suddenly captured - they were under attack!

Though they managed to hide, in the smuggler's den

They had no way to escape - they were trapped in a pen!


"I'll disable the beam, you distract the guards

I have unfinished business aboard this Death Star"

Old Ben was Kenobi, a Jedi Knight supreme

And he could feel Vader on board, like a dream



They fought and they ran, sneaking between the guards

It seemed that victory was here - luck in their cards!

And with the princess they managed to escape

"But wait, that was too easy - it had to be fake!" 

"Too easy - you're joking, that was incredibly hard!

And Old Ben got killed! Our victory's marred!

Despite her objections, they went on their way

Down to the rebel base, to enter the fray!

But Leia was right - it had been a trap!

The were tracked to the base! The rebellion was scrap!

"If we don't hurry, soon they'll kill us all! 

But look at these plans - we can blow up that ball!

We'll need pilots with skill, we'll need pilots with grace

To fire proton torpedoes, right here, at this place!

This mission is hard - without doubt, some will die

But it is our only hope - so fly pilots, fly!"


And so Luke joined their ranks, and he jumped in a ship

To fly down a trench - pray a wing doesn't clip!

And though many were killed - in fact, most happened to die

Luke made it to the end - and his torpedoes did fly!

He shot without computer, Someone said "Use the Force!"

And with that mysterious power, he struck at the source!

With luck and with skill, sacrifice and Hope,

The Death Star exploded - Luke's a hero! Don't mope!

From farm boy to Jedi, an unknown to the best

Luke's journey wasn't over - it's just the start of his quest!

#### [WP] So, you humans just drew imaginary lines on your planet and fought real wars defending them?

Score: 1882

FADE IN:

INT. A DARK ROOM

*A young man sits on a large blob of slowly undulating plastic. This is DAVE. Each time that he shifts his weight, the whitish mass beneath him adjusts itself slightly, forcing him to move in a constant search for comfort.*

**T'AAR:** (*O.S.*) I'm so sorry about the wait, ma'am!

*A diminutive alien walks into view. This is T'AAR, a bureaucrat, who is carrying what appears to be a rectangle of softly glowing light.*

**DAVE:** It's "sir," actually.    
**T'AAR:** Oh, I'd much prefer to stick to the formalities, ma'am.    
**DAVE:** "Sir" is a formality.

*T'aar glances at the glowing rectangle.*

**T'AAR:** Really? What does it mean?    
**DAVE:** Uh, well... it's the masculine form of "ma'am."    
**T'ARR:** You distinguish by gender in your honorifics?    
**DAVE:** I guess?    
**T'AAR:** Interesting. Well, ma'am... uh, sir... I understand that you've registered a formal complaint with the Galactic Transportation Authority.

*Dave suddenly looks desperate.*

**DAVE:** No! No, it's like I keep telling everyone: This is all a big misunderstanding!    
**T'AAR:** I'm sure it is, ma... sir. We'll see about getting it sorted right out. What was the nature of your complaint?    
**DAVE:** I didn't make a complaint!

*Once again, T'aar glances at the glowing rectangle.*

**T'AAR:** References to intercourse are considered expletives in your culture, yes?    
**DAVE:** In some situations, yes, but...    
**T'AAR:** (*Interrupting*) Oh, wait! This is back to that whole "gendered honorifics" thing, isn't it?    
**DAVE:** ... What?    
**T'AAR:** Sorry, just an observation. To the point, though: You *did* shout "Screw GTA!" over an all-systems broadcast, did you not?

*Dave's desperation gives way to nervousness.*

**T'AAR:** (*CONT'D*) Once translated from your tongue, "GTA" becomes an initialism for...    
**DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) I didn't know *aliens* would hear it! I was just mad about a video game!    
**T'AAR:** "Video game?"    
**DAVE:** It's... it's entertainment. We use computers to simulate the world, and then we... you know, we play games.    
**T'AAR:** Oh, yes, we do similar things when we're designing ships.    
**DAVE:** Well, there's a little more to it than that. Like, in GTA, you drive around stealing things and shooting people.

*T'aar's enormous black eyes widen further.*

**T'AAR:** Sorry... you *shoot* people? With weapons?    
**DAVE:** It's not real!    
**T'AAR:** I should hope not. This is entertainment to you?    
**DAVE:** Yeah. It seems kind of weird, right? What with all the war going on.    
**T'AAR:** What war? Your species isn't space-faring.    
**DAVE:** Oh. Well, it's... we fight each other.

*A moment of silence passes.*

**T'AAR:** Is this a joke?    
**DAVE:** What? No!    
**T'AAR:** You honestly fight amongst yourselves? Why?    
**DAVE:** There are lots of reasons. Resources, religion...    
**T'AAR:** (*Interrupting*) What's that?    
**DAVE:** A can of worms that I'm not going to get into right now.    
**T'AAR:** ... Your species fights over worms.    
**DAVE:** No! We mostly fight over land!    
**T'AAR:** What land?    
**DAVE:** *Any* land!    
**T'AAR:** Ma'am, you're not making any sense.    
**DAVE:** "Sir."    
**T'AAR:** Yes?    
**DAVE:** ... No, no, *I'm* a "sir."    
**T'AAR:** Oh, yes, you mentioned as much. Now, please elaborate.    
**DAVE:** Look, we have these different countries, okay? Some of them don't like each other.    
**T'AAR:** So they go to war.    
**DAVE:** Yes.    
**T'AAR:** In video games.    
**DAVE:** No, for real.    
**T'AAR:** You *physically kill each other* because people on one piece of land don't like people on another piece of land?    
**DAVE:** Ye... yes?    
**T'AAR:** And this has something to do with worms?    
**DAVE:** N... well... look, it's complicated.

*T'aar's voice adopts a patronizing tone.*

**T'AAR:** Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it's very complicated. Just wait here for a couple more minutes, okay? I'll be back shortly.    
**DAVE:** No, wait, what about...

*Before Dave can finish his sentence, T'aar disappears into the darkness.*

**T'AAR:** (*O.S.*) Make yourself comfortable!

*Dave shifts around on the blob of undulating plastic. Eventually, he gets up and sits on the floor.*

**DAVE:** (*To himself*) Well, it beats visiting the DMV...

FADE OUT.

#### [WP] You applied for a job at google, everything goes well and only one interview remains: They'd just like an explanation for your search history.

Score: 1843

"Well, Mr. Powell," the interviewer adjusted his glasses, "Your references all seem to be in order, and everyone spoke very highly of you."

The last knot in my stomach unraveled. *Thank god*. I mean, I knew that I would have nothing to worry about. Otherwise, why would I have listed those people as references? But still: it was nice to finally hear. I'd been through days of testing and seen the applicant pool whittled down from two hundred to just three of us left, applying for two spots. 

"Just one last thing." He removed a large (like, book-sized) manila folder from his desk and slammed it down in front of me, making the whole desk shake. "Let's discuss your search history." The sentence that *every* young man fears, though I'd been expecting it to come from my girlfriend, not a potential employer. 

"I..." He slid the folder over to me and then tapped his fingers together like Mr. Burns. I extended one finger and flipped the top of the folder open, like there was something disgusting inside that I didn't want to touch. 

First page was categorized as "Dangerous." It was a pretty broad term that included things like that time that I'd worked the graveyard shift and decided to learn all I could about the Kennedy Assassination. Then there was the times that I'd googled how to build bombs, propaganda techniques... you know, things that would make me seem like some sort of supervillain or terrorist. "Well this is all..." I stuttered, looking back down at the page as though some explanation might jump out at me. "Look, there's...." I was just curious, I swear!

He cleared his throat and nodded down, asking me to flip to the next bookmark. I turned to the next section, titled "Porn." I don't need to even go into detail, but let's just say that there were some *unorthodox* searches that would probably send my mother into a coma if she ever read this page. Even reading the searches without seeing the results made me feel like I needed a shower. "I can't be the only one who has looked at..." I glanced back down at the page again. Ok, maybe I was.

"Now, is this really the sort of person we want working at Google?" the interviewer asked.

I bowed my head, and I was just empty inside. I'd gotten so far through the process. It was in my grasp... and now it was slipping away. "Look, it's probably too late to change your mind. But isn't this *why* we have the internet? So that we can explore curiosity without judgment and get real answers instead of asking someone who doesn't really know either? Should we *really* be condemning that?"

He snorted. "Oh, *that's* what you thought the issue was?" He leaned over his desk and tapped the right corner of every page, showing the *Bing* logo. "We don't care what you're searching for, we just have doubts about your *judgment.*"

I gave a sigh of relief and closed the folder as fast as possible. I didn't even want to see what other sections were in there. "I was only able to use Internet Explorer from my work computer, and Bing was the default that I couldn't change." I explained through a nervous smile. Hopefully he wouldn't make the connection that all of those searches had been *while I was at work*. 

"Ah!" He slid the folder off the side of his desk, stood up, and shook my hand. "Well in that case, welcome aboard!"

#### [WP] Upon his deathbed, your father's last words to you is the worst dad joke you've ever heard.

Score: 1731

After yet another boring day at school, I got home, ready to make food and spend the entire night procrastinating. As I walked up, I noticed an abnormal number of cars littering the area, some even double-parked on our street. *Must be some kind of party. Damnit, Dad.*

The front door was unlocked, and the main room was entirely empty, but I could hear some commotion upstairs and slowly creeped up to see what was going on. There were at least fifty people packed into the upper floor, like sardines. I recognized a few of them as aunts or uncles, though some I'd never seen.

"Oh, sweetie, you're home. Come this way," my Aunt Jane said, planting a fat kiss on my forehead. She dragged me through the crowd and into my father's room, where my dad was bundled under the covers with an IV running into his arm.

"Hey, buddy," he said softly with a weak smile. I walked up to him and furrowed my brow.

"Dad, what's going on? Why are all these people here?"

He grabbed my hand and patted it. "I've been trying to keep this from you as long as possible, but I can't anymore."

"Dad, what are you talking about?" I asked wildly, heart pounding against my chest as if trying to break free. "I'm confused."

"Hi, Confused," he said, gripping my hand. A single tear flowed from his left eye. "I'm Dying."

#### [WP] A man is transported into the universe of infomercials and his ability to complete everyday tasks causes people to love, worship and fear him

Score: 1694

"Everyone shut up and watch!"  An old man commanded.  

I felt a bead of sweat run down my forehead.  Every eye in the building was trained on me.  With a final twist of my hand I removed the tomato can's lid and placed it on the counter.

"He didn't cut himself?"

"How did he not spill it?"

A chorus of questions erupted around me.  Hands slapped me on the back in congratulation.  They happily paraded me to my next task to see if I could accomplish it.  Pouring laundry detergent.  Thunderous applause again as I did not spill a single drop on my white shirt.  The people were becoming more and more fanatical with every passing second.  Women were throwing themselves at me, men wanted to be me.  I felt like a god.  Until I felt something hit me in the back of the skull.

"Billy Mays here.  You know why I have called this meeting."  Billy Mays shouted.

Billy May's shouting woke me up, and amplified my splitting headache.  I tried to move but my legs and arms were tied to a chair.  

"What? Where am I?"  I said groggily.

"Where you are doesn't matter.  What does matter is you. Ruining. EVERYTHING!"  Billy's fist slammed down onto the table spilling drinks.  The other people at the table cursed quietly and got up to get paper towels.  

"No you morons, the sham-wow.  Jesus."  Billy shouted.

"Now.  Where was I,"  he paused for a second, "that's right.  Torturing you."  He stood up and approached me with a nasty looking pair of pliers.

"I see you admiring my pliers.  Well this is a six in one multi-tool that can tear you so many new ones you couldn't believe it.  And only for four easy payments of nineteen ninety nine.  A steal really."  He backhanded me, my teeth felt loose and my head rang.

"Why are you doing this?"  I pleaded.

"Because if people realize they can do things without all this useless shit, we will be ruined!"  He back handed me again.  I spit out a bit of blood.  The straps holding me down felt like they were getting looser.  I shifted in my seat.  Sure enough the strap holding my chest and arms slid down a fraction of an inch.

Billy saw me struggling against my bindings and laughed.  "Those straps can hold down a rhino.  I know I used them during my last trophy hunt."  He said wickedly.

"Grab me the clean.  We're going to drown him in it."  One of the others grabbed a large white and blue bucket and walked it over.  White water sloshed over the side with every step he took.  Billy squeezed his eyes shut and pressed his hand to his forehead.  "I swear to god, look at what you are doing!  Now you have to clean it up!  Use the two in one mop vacuum.  Cuts down on cleaning time by fifty percent!"  

While Billy was distracted yelling at his incompetent help I had been getting out of my bindings.  The straps on my feet fell away as I stood up, and the one that was on my chest and arms had fallen low enough I could undo the clip with my hands.

The man walking the bucket over saw me first.  

"B-b-b-"  He tried to stammer out.  

I threw a strap around Billy's neck and pulled tight.  I kicked the back of his knees out and he fell.  His face growing more blue with every second.  The others in the room did nothing.  They watched in horror as Billy's eyes bulged and his body spasmed for the last time. 

I stood over the corpse staring them down.  As one they fell to their knees and prostrated themselves in front of me.  

"Please don't hurt us!"  They cried out.

"No.  I have a better idea."

The infomercial ran on every channel every day in between peoples favorite shows.

"Introducing JOHN!  Are you sick and tired of not having something to worship?  Your god not doing a good enough job answering prayers?  Well look no further than JOHN!  He can do anything!  The best part?  To become a member of the Church of John all you need to do is send in just one easy payment of nineteen ninety nine!"

#### [WP] A young child summons a demon, but they only want a friend.

Score: 1588

"Are you sure about that?" the demon asked from inside the pentagram that had drawn on the floor in dust and candle wax. He'd arrived from the pits of Hell with horrid horns and terrible teeth, but all of that was gone now. He looked like someone you'd run into on the street, if you happened the run into pitch black shadows with yellow eyes.

Megan nodded.

"That's your command?"

Megan nodded for a second time and then coughed. The machine to her right beeped in protest.

"All right," he said. The glowing circle that was holding him in broke as he took the deal that Megan had offered him. He was to own her soul as soon as she died, but he was going to be her friend until then. 

Megan smiled and then waved him over to the bed she was sitting on. The demon looked from her to the foot of the bed and then plopped himself onto it. He stared at her, his eyes acting like a pair of headlights. He was frankly confused. Demons weren't exactly well versed in the 'best friends' department, but it was his job now. 

"Now what?" he asked.

Megan shrugged and laid down on the bed.

"I don't sleep," the demon explained.

Megan made a circle on her chest with her fist, and then closed her eyes. The Demon waited until morning.

The next morning was similar; the demon asked what to do, and Megan shrugged again. Frankly there wasn't much that you could do in the hospital without one of the nurses wagging a finger at you. Megan basically needed to stay in her bed, and that meant the Demon was going to as well. He did all of the talking while they were there. The Demon only left when the teacher came to remind her how to speak herself. 

In the afternoon the Demon brought her ice cream. She didn't ask how he got it or how he knew that her favorite flavor was chocolate. Megan just let him know that she loved it. He started to bring it every day.

Against the odds Megan ended up getting better, and the Demon was relieved. She was allowed out of the hospital and back into her school. She saw Sally, who knew what was going on, and the other girls who didn't have any idea where she went. Megan's mom had given her this little board that she could write on and clear. It was easier to talk like that than it was to use a language she barely knew. 

The other girls eventually stopped talking to Megan as much because she couldn't really talk back. Sally stopped talking to Megan because the rest of her friends weren't. The Demon still talked to Megan. He knew what she was saying no matter how many ways she said it. Sometimes she said things wrong but he didn't try to correct her. He just smiled with black teeth.

The Demon got Megan ice cream on her birthday again. It was almost their thing now, and as long as it was late at night nobody knew she was getting extra treats. She was ten, which meant she was pretty old.

When she was thirteen, they finally moved her schools. She'd taken to signing to the Demon when people were around, and that just wouldn't do. Her parents said something about isolation, and she didn't agree with them. The Demon didn't either, but she told him that her parents weren't bad people. He already knew that. 

She went to a school where everyone could sign, but nobody else liked the music that she did. In fact, none of them were into music at all. The demon continued to spend time with her, but she had to write to him now. The rest of the kids could hear her hands.

When she was 16, the Demon helped her learn to drive. Her father was trying, but he wasn't very good at it. The Demon wasn't a very good driver either; he'd never done it before, and it made things a little hard. Megan got used to it.On the way to university when she was 17, Megan got into a car crash. It wasn't that bad, but they needed to go to the hospital. The Demon sat beside her in the ambulance.

The nurses ended up putting her back in the same room that she'd summoned the Demon in. The cancer that had taken her voice was back, and it wasn't very happy about her beating it the first time. She lit up the CAT scan like a Christmas tree. She lost in early December.

The Demon didn't cry when Megan stopped breathing. He was calm when she flat-lined, and the Doctors started to panic. She'd been in a lot of pain for the past while, and he hadn't liked it. 

He held out a hand to her once she was pronounced dead, and she grabbed it while also staying still.After all, she'd lost to cancer, but she'd promised her soul to him, and they were friends.

#### [WP] The evacuation of Earth is complete. You decide to do one final fly over of the world to see the monuments deserted. However, you slowly realize something about them that no one ever has.

Score: 1443

Parts 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 are linked below!

*****

The radio crackled to life, snapping me from my hypnosis on the waves of endless clouds. "Charlie Unit, report when you make visual contact, over." I confirmed, thrusting the yoke forwards to duck beneath the clouds as my wings sliced a path through them for a moment before I emerged below. 

"Visual with Earth confirmed. She's ugly as ever. Over." The grey landscape made me shudder; mountains and hills steamed with escaping gasses, reminding me to snap on my oxygen tank before the air became too toxic to breathe. What were once luscious forests and deep blue seas were now fossilized wood and empty basins large enough to fit the entire evacuated population a thousand times.  Famine had come first as the food supplies and water ran out. Wars followed as countries jockeyed for power of the limited rations with the traditional powers emerging victorious. But in the end, the celebration of conquests was short-lived as leaders came to grips with reality and realized remaining on Earth meant certain death. That's how we wound up in outer space; searching desperately for a habitable planet as we wandered aimlessly in the barely adequate motherships.

"Steer for 29 dot 9792 north, 31 dot 1342 east. Should see pyramids if they're still above ground. Do you copy?" I confirmed, repeating the numbers back to them, and sped towards the ancient monuments, long since abandoned as the land grew brittle and inhospitable. The pyramids were smaller than I remembered from pictures, courtesy of a thick layer of ash and dirt that had built around their base. The Sphinx peeked out nearby, only its eyes visible now. They stared at me ominously as I touched down; the last living creature to be on our once beautiful planet. The scientists claimed that the Earth's core had grown cold but no proposed solution worked and everything had fallen apart as we watched and warred like savages over the rapidly dwindling supplies.

"Visual contact confirmed. Pyramids are intact. Landing now. Out." I slowly hovered to the ground near the largest pyramid, taking care to touch down on a solid-looking patch. My orders were to only make visual contact but I figured no harm in exploring a bit. I had never had the chance to visit the pyramids while civilization bloomed. An item to cross off my bucket list now, it seemed. Donned in the safe-suit and with the oxygen tank strapped to my back, I grabbed the grapple I had smuggled aboard my craft and started the short but arduous trek towards the pyramid. The world reeked of noxious fumes that found their way to me in spite of the helmet I wore. And death. It smelled of death and looked of death and everything emanated death. I gagged softly before regaining my composure.

The pyramid loomed above me, massive in spite of the portion buried below. With a grin and a habitual glance around for any superiors who might reprimand me, I shot the grapple towards the top of the pyramid and steadily made my way upwards. Ashen winds whipped around me, stirring up vortices of the dust that had dealt death to billions as we scrambled to evacuate. I reached the top short of breath and sweating as the Sun beat down mercilessly on the endless wasteland. Looking out, I could see where the city once stood, only the top of buildings signalling that we had ever even lived here. Morbid and disgusting yet oddly beautiful.

I struggled to catch my breath, awed by the enormity of the emptiness we had left behind. Just a couple years back, the ground below would have been bustling with thousands of tourists as they gaped at the massive structure. Now there was nothing; not even Nature had survived the brutal apocalypse. Leaning back against the apex of the pyramid, I jumped and nearly became Earth's final victim as the top caved inwards, revealing a passageway into the depths of the abandoned monument.

"Base, this is Charlie Unit..." I paused, still struggling to understand what I was seeing.

"We copy, Charlie Unit. Is there an issue? All we needed you to check was that the pyramid was in fact intact. Nothing more. Over." The voice sounded harsh over the intercom, scolding me even as I took in the last of our planet. I shook my head numbly as I cautiously shone my flashlight into the abyss.

"I... I'm at the top of the pyramid," I started slowly, knowing I would be punished for my transgression upon my return to the motherships. "And... Well, the top just opened. There's a passage way into the pyramid... Permission to enter? Over." I stepped inside, knowing permission would be denied but that I had to see where the passageway led, the boy in me urging me to explore. I thought back to my history lessons back when the Earth was friendly and painted blue and green. No teacher had ever mentioned a passageway at the top of the pyramids or even a way to enter the massive structures.

"Permission denied. Abort mission immediately. I repeat, you do not have permission to enter the pyramid. Do you copy?" A tinge of desperation edged the voice as it repeated itself. I scowled and would have spat had my breathing apparatus not prevented me. Ignoring the orders from base, I carefully stepped down the stairway as it spiraled downwards into the darkness.

#### [WP] We've explored more of the lunar surface than the bottom of the ocean. NASA knows what's down there, and it trying to get us off Earth as fast as possible

Score: 1381

It's called the Fermi Paradox, the fact that in a universe that should be teeming with intelligent life we have heard nothing from our neighbors. That where space should be a cacophony of cultures all shouting to the cosmos 'we exist' there is only dead chill silence.  It should not puzzle us,  every day when we see the flash of sinister movement outside our windows or hear the sudden creaking of the floor elsewhere in the house we pause and even our breathing stills. When we are afraid we go still and silent, and all of those civilizations in space are afraid. They are so tremendously, very, afraid because they REMEMBER. 


We humans call our planet Earth, soil, so integral is the land to our identity it seems that nothing else exists but the oceans are larger and they came first. Before life ever awkwardly flopped its way onto soil it grew in the depths, before humankind ever used its wits to become the fiercest killers on land yet others were using theirs to become the butchers of the sea. 


It is humankind that has forgotten, forgotten that the land was no prize to be claimed but rather the distant shore to flee too. That for all that we are, we fled those even more intelligent and more malicious than ourselves. 
When those on land go missing humans spin tales of aliens coming to carry them away, of tests and needles. When ships go missing we do not question it, we feel no need to spin such theories because deep in our collective unconscious we know. The depths are deadly, do not venture there. 


We have ventured there, of course, our sonar echoing and hulls straining to hold themselves together. Initially assumed remnants of some ancient civilization it was NASA scientists and their more modern understanding that finally put meaning to those lines and shapes as launch facilities. Those scientists that finally identified  the gunships, the missiles, the bombs. The great slaughtering race the galaxy fears is not on some distant shore looking towards the heavens but rather beneath our very own waves. 


The cold war was a sham to build enough bombs, the space race necessary testing and the later near collapse of the space program all a ruse to hide the construction of the generation ships. Project Victus is nearly complete, if all goes well soon the ships will rise and humankind will flee the smoldering cinder that Earth has become. We only pretend to fear the day we leave a dead world behind us. It's our greatest hope.

#### [WP] You work in tech support. One day you receive a call from someone you begin to suspect is God and, boy, is he mad.

Score: 1375

There were two beeps in my headset as the call came through and immediately I could hear muffled swearing down the line. I always preferred being friendly, but sometimes with difficult calls it was better to be slightly sharp and officious, to keep people from getting too carried away; I called it my bitch voice. 

"Hi, you're through to the faults team at MegaNet, my name is Emily, can I take your account number please?" The voice was still muffled and so I tried again a little louder. "*Hello*, you're through to Emily, can I *take* your account number. To my left Jack looked across and smiled, he knew my bitch voice and could sense that this was going to be an interesting call. 

My voice must have filtered through this time and there was the noise of the phone being brought up suddenly to the callers face. "Oh, uh yeah, what do you need from me?" 

I let the silence go just long enough to show my displeasure. "Your account number, *Sir*." 

"Shit, account number... uh, look Emily, I don't have a clue. The problem is that my wifi is out and I need to get it up as I have people coming round and..."

"*Sir*," I interrupted, the bitch voice growing ever less friendly. "Without access to your account I am unable to help you. If you do not have your account number to hand then can you give me your address?" 

The phone went muffled again, as if he had pressed it against his chest. "She wants the address." There was laughter in the background. "Uh, no honey, that's not going to work, I'm not going to be on the system with an address." 

I looked across at Jack, who was smirking as I rolled my eyes. "Sir, *all* accounts have an address, it's where we connect your internet."

There was a long sigh. "Uuuuuh, okay Emily, tell you what, we'll use an account number." 

"Oh, you have your account number now do you sir?" My voice could've cut glass. 

"Just go ahead and put one into the box and pull it up." 

I waited for the rest of the numbers. "It's an eight digit number sir and can be found on your bill or on your..." 

"Just throw it in sweetie and hit your big white enter key underneath the picture of your cat stuck to the monitor and see what happens." Smugness oozed from his voice 

I took a breath to stay calm, he was right about the picture, lucky guess. "Sir, if you won't give me your number then I am unable to..." 

His voice lowered and became soft. "Do it Emily." My fingers had moved without my conscious involvement and an account was showing on my screen. 

I blinked and peered forward. The details were... correct and all in order, but just a little... difficult to see. I leaned back and rubbed my eyes and tried again. I could *see* the account details, name, address, all of the usual and I could understand them, but at the same time I had no idea what was in front of me. 

"Uh... I'm going to have to ask you a few security questions Sir." I waved frantically at Jack and pointed at my screen. He pushed off his desk and trundled across to me, the wheels on his chair squeaking as he moved across the grey industrial carpet.

He came back immediately. "No, let's just get on with this." 

"Okay, no problem, how can I help." The words had *come* from me, but again I felt as if they had bypassed my actual involvement. Nevertheless I didn't seem to be able to take them back and all I could hope was that this wouldn't be one of my calls that got monitored. Jack was squinting at the screen, moving his head in and out, but seemed no more able than I was to see anything.

The caller sounded slightly annoyed. "First up, tell Jack to piss off and stop looking at your screen." 

I jolted back in my seat and looked around. "Is this a joke? What's going on?" 

They sighed. "No, just... look, my wifi router is broken, the little lights are flashing but I get no connection. What do I do?" 

"Uuuuhhhh, have you tried turning it off and on again." 

There was a pause. "Oh shit." The phone went muffled. "Did we turn it off and on again?" He came back a moment later. "Hang on." 

I heard muffled thumps and then thirty or so seconds later he eturned again. "Shiiiit, that worked Emily. Man I feel stupid as hell. Tell you what, to make up for wasting your time I'll do you a favour." His voice lowered again. "What do you desire more than any other thing in the entire world." 

A million images flooded my mind; money, fame, power, all seemed within my grasp, but it wasn't what I wanted *most* and I couldn't lie, not to him. 

"I want it to beep once, not twice when a new call comes through." 

Laughter flooded down the line. "You got it girl." 

There was a click as he hung up and I was left staring at the account that I couldn't read, until a second later it flicked away and the normal screen returned. I looked to Jack, who was still sitting beside me, looking puzzled. My mouth opened but I had no idea how to explain what had just happened.  

There was no time to figure it out and with only ten seconds between calls it was probably better not to try. My phone beeped once and I was connected to the next caller.

#### [WP] You are a professional assassin for the CIA. But you are also a double agent. One day, you are assigned with killing a foreign agent. This foreign agent is your other alias.

Score: 1318

"I want confirmed kill in twenty-four hours, understood?"

I sat completely still on the other end of the line. It was secure, as was all of my communications with the CIA, but this one was the most important call I had ever received. "Understood, sir."

"This is *the* target we've been hunting for the past twenty-two years. You remember him I'm sure, he disrupted you in Venice. He's finally slipped up."

"I'm going over all of it now, sir. The file is secured."

"Good luck."

"Thank you, sir."

I hung up the phone with a satisfied clunk and took one of the longest, and deepest, breaths I had ever taken. It had been a long time since I heard the name that my *Commander* had just spoke on the phone. Even longer since I even cared about it. And yet, here I was, with the file a few feet from my shoes, delivered by an unsuspecting intern, in a brown manila envelope.

I was in South America. On a mission to make sure a drug deal in the area went sour, which would ultimately end in the entire area spiraling out of control. I had already seen parts of my work begin, with fires spreading and civilian evacuating. I was done. And my next mission was to be all that bigger.

I had been with the CIA for twenty-seven years, acting as a professional assassin for the better part of the last two decades. Highly trained, extremely dangerous, and in any part of the world at any different country. I already knew where I needed to go when I heard him tell me the name. I wasn't looking forward to it to say the least. To be quite honest, I wanted to go home and visit my family in America.

But orders are orders and I as grabbed the envelope off the floor I knew this order was going to be the hardest one to accomplish. I slid my finger under the seal and opened it in one swoop. The file was thin, only a few pages. *Nikolai Vinokurov*, former KGB agent operating in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, who went off the grid after that. The file didn't contain a photo of him, but his trail had slipped up. 

In South America.

Convenient.

I skimmed through the file. All of it was still there. The only addition they had added to it was an addendum at the end of the last page, after classifying him as a priority target. I read through it once.

*Transmission intercepted in Brazil on July 17th, 2017. Encryption was heavy, but trace contains Russian backwater company located in the city. Most likely used as a proxy. Mission Alert: Target location identified.*

I had screwed up. I, of course, needed to send my superiors the mission details of disrupting the drug cartel; one in which they had long agreed was necessary. But I had messed up. The proxy wasn't secure or I had used the wrong pass phrase with the Russian business. Ever since the dissolution of the KGB in the early 90's, the general pass phrases and such just seemed like ordinary conversation to other native Russians. I had lost more than half my contacts in those days.

Now, I must've lost more. And I knew if I had messed up here in South America, it would seen be traced. The age of spies had ended long ago and I was lucky enough not to end up on the chopping block like the rest of my comrades. I had survived all of it. The Red Scare that lasted well into the 70's and 80's. The age when spies became obsessions in pop culture. The age of information. It was all in my past and as far as I knew, I was just about the Russian's last spy in the CIA.

I had considered giving it up. Just abandoning all transmission sources with the KGB and the Intelligence Service in each decade. When the times got tough. Russia was as much my home as the boat that took me to America when I was a teenager. The *real* Nikolai Vinokurov had died in South Vietnam, and I was called upon to take his place when I was only twenty. I had grown up in America, played with Americans, dated Americans. Hell, I had married an American. But I was always loyal to the Motherland. I was always a compatriot in their fight.

When the other spies began to be outed, when men and women I recognized from training were shown in newspaper and TV I panicked, but I did not slip up. I faltered, but I did not lose the fight. Yet now, holding Nikolai's file in my hand once again and seeing everything they said *he* did, and not knowing all the things *I* did as him. Well, right then and there I knew. I wasn't a Russian. I was an American.

Faking a death would be easy. We were trained how to do that long ago. But I didn't want to fake *my* death. I didn't want to fake Jeremy White's death. I wanted to kill Nikolai Vinokurov. I wanted to finish him and be done with the spy life.

I wanted to go home and see my wife and kids. To say hello to my neighbors and cut my lawn. I wanted to smell the fresh air of America because it was the only air I had memories in. Russia, it was just a figment in my mind. My home country yes, but not my country. Not my people.

As I stood there, in that shotty little South American apartment with Nikolai's file in my hand I realized something. Something I had realized a long time ago but never wanted to admit I think. I knew, then and there, that the world didn't need spies anymore. Countries didn't need double agents. Countries needed peace; and the people just needed to survive.

#### [WP] Write a seemingly normal story, except for the last sentence, which makes the entire story creepy

Score: 1290

I lie in bed, listening to the rain gently pattering on the skylight.  How did I get so lucky, I wonder?  I roll over gently, smiling at the sleeping form next to me.  The love of my life, she lies there sleeping.  She's on her side, facing away from the window - she never did like nighttime storms as much as I did.  I caress her gently, from her shoulder down to her hip, but I stop when she starts to stir - as much as I love her, I'd hate to wake her.  Though she doesn't have my insomnia, she still never gets enough sleep.  Someone has to look out for her health.  So I resume my quiet introspection as the wind stirs the damp leaves outside.  How lucky am I, to have been with the woman I love every single night for two years?  Never a night apart, even when we travel.  It fills me with so much joy that I think, for a moment anyways, that tomorrow might be the day.  Tomorrow, I might finally find the courage to introduce myself to her.

#### [WP] Aliens have finally reached Earth and, per Intergalactic Law, have sent their most average champion to win the planet. A device is sent to find the most average human to accept the challenge and duel for the fate of Earth. It's you.

Score: 1245

The gigantic stage was, frankly, a little unnecessary in my eyes, but they kept telling me over and over again that the TV networks had demanded it and so I had no choice. It had only been three days since they had come for me, the government van pulling up to my door and then the thunderous knocking until I answered. I suppose I could have said no then, but when the President of the USA asks a favour… well, it becomes tricky to refuse. 

The alien ship had landed in the middle of London, crushing about a square mile of densely populated housing, but that had soon been forgotten as soon as they stepped out onto their little balcony and started their broadcast. For Earth it was the first communication from a species born on another planet, but they didn't seem to be particularly worried. 

Hundreds of TV cameras focussed in on the tall green creature as it gracefully extended six arms from its body and grasped a piece of the ship that had unfolded up to where it’s ‘head’ seemed to be. It looked from side to side and then leaned in. A complex series of grunts and hums emerged from its body and for a moment there was a tinge of disappointment from the crowd, before the translation kicked in and it blared out in English from somewhere behind the alien. 

“**EARTH**, you have been challenged to the *ULTIMATE TEST OF A SPECIES.* The triphosphic people of Merillium have send out a CHALLENGE and YOU MUST reply. If you accept then you will need to nominate the statistically most normal human to fight to go up against the representative of Merillium in the *ultimate challenge*.”

“Should you prevail, you will be given your choice of technologies, including anti-gravity, interstellar space flight and the secret to getting stubborn stains out of cloth and fabric without bleaching. *What is your answer*?” 

It’s hard to know exactly what it accepted as its answer, but the massive cheer that followed its speech seemed to satisfy it. Most people who were there on that day now claim that they were just happy that they alien hadn’t immediately begun vaporising people and hadn’t even really been able to hear what it said, but the die was cast. 

That led to me. We had 24 hours to prepare and a mammoth task was undertaken by governments all over the world. After mass analysis of billions of people it turned out that I was the most “average” of all of humanity. Average height, weight, intelligence and even, sad to say, genital length, I was right in the middle of them all. 

Soon I was on a flight, heading for London with a dozen generals at my side, all briefing me on what to look for, what to say and how to act, but no one seemed to have any idea what I was about to come up against. By the time I arrived they had bulldozed several streets in front of the ship and created a wide flat area with a *massive* stage set up on it. Hundreds of cameras lined every area and the crowds had been pushed far, far back. 

I stood in the middle of the stage with Helena Campano, Spanish TV presenter and the chosen host of this unique TV spectacle and listened as she babbled away into her microphone. My eyes were glued to the ship, just waiting for something to emerge. At last, a crack appeared and a great ramp began to swing down, it was time. 

The green alien came first, dragging behind him a white box and then after him came a yellow creature that seemed to hiss in the air as it walked. Many scientists had speculated that a triphosphic alien would have difficulty surviving on our planet and so it seemed to be proving, but still they moved forward until they stood opposite me. 

Helena had moved back and I could hear her speaking rapid Spanish somewhere behind me but it was the alien whose voice was loudest. He seemed to still connect to his ship and the translations blared out at incredible volume. 

“WELCOME, this will be a single round fight TO THE DEATH.” He paused as if expecting applause but none was forthcoming. “PREPARE yourself human.” 

He stepped back and I was left facing the yellow hissing… thing. It was a shambling, roughly humanoid alien, with large black eyes at the top of its head and long arms that hung low, almost to the ground. I backed away, trying to get some sort of distance on the creature in front of me, but it shuffled after me quickly. 

A fight to the death? This was not exactly what I had signed up for… but it had been a possibility. There had been soldiers at one point, I think maybe SAS and they had tried to teach me some basic moves, but it had all been a blur. What was it they had said? Something about hitting hard and fast and hoping like hell. 

It came closer and on instinct I took a low clumsy swing with my foot and connected on what might have been its leg. It paused, looked down at where I had hit it and then exploded into a yellow cloud that covered the surrounding area in a thick yellow goo and sent the first alien scurrying back to my side. 

“CONGRATULATIONS humanity, your representative has been victorious and now it is time to choose your prize.” 

They had all been very specific about this and as the alien shoved his microphone type object in my face I spoke clearly. “Interstellar space flight, please.”

I was surprised that my voice was not amplified like the aliens, there was no noise at all from the giant speakers and just some grunts from the beast that went untranslated, but it replied almost immediately anyway. “WELL DONE and excellent choice human. You have chosen the secret to getting stubborn stains out of cloth and fabric without bleaching.” 

My head twisted around and I could suddenly see angry faces all around the stage. “Wait, what? No, hang on...” 

It ignored me and moved over to the white box and pulled out a brightly coloured package. Its voice had dropped low and silky. “Whether you are fighting an alien species or just keeping the kids clothes clean, you can trust in XXIXAK cleaner to get oil, blood or even Merillium goo out of any of your materials.” 

I felt a hand pulling at my clothes and a second later it had pulled off my jumper and stuffed it into the white box. “Look at how it keeps the colours fresh and the clothes crisp.” it pulled out my jumper and it was indeed very clean looking, but I felt it would be a poor move to compliment it. 

The alien looked around. “Now, as a species, how many packs can I put you down for?”

#### [WP] A modern teenager is transported into a fantasy world, where they are forced into a quest with young witches and wizards their age. Fortunately, they've got a backpack full of high-tech gizmos to help them along.

Score: 1171

I stared at the wizened old man in front of me. I didn't even know how I had gotten here - wherever *here* was. I remembered opening my notebook for Chemistry, only instead of yesterday's notes about covalent bonds there was a bright purple portal that sucked me to friggin' Narnia or whatever.

"A noble quest? Seriously?" I rolled my eyes. "How cliche can you get? Wait, wait, don't tell me, there's an ancient prophecy saying that some unknown hero will come from a far-off land and defeat the ancient evil and bring a new era of peace and prosperity to the land?"

The old man paused with his mouth open for several seconds. Yeah, that confirms that. Stupid prophecies, never liked the things.

"It doesn't matter if there's a prophecy, Taylor!" he finally snapped. "If nothing else, do it for the knowledge that you're helping us, that you're bettering yourself!"

"Blah blah," I said, rolling my eyes again. "Whatever. I'll do it. Now I've seen how these stories work, you've probably got a group to help me already picked out, right?"

"You.... You have helped other lands from evils such as this?" The man laughed with joy. "Then perhaps we have hope after all! Come, come meet your fellow adventurers!"

He grabbed my by the hand, and I almost tripped over my backpack, which I suddenly realized had been dragged through the portal with me by snagging on my leg. I bent down and threw it over my shoulder. It would probably be more comfortable than whatever packs these people had. And besides, my iPod and my Kindle were in there. Wherever the "ancient evil" was, we weren't going to be getting there any time soon, and I had no intention of getting bored.

We reached the back of his cabin and I saw two other children around my own age, sparring. One was a tall handsome boy wearing heavy armor and twirling a sword as though it were a natural extension of his body, and the other was a scrawny girl with long flowing robes who was deflecting his blows using some form of magic. I couldn't help but laugh at the cliche-ness of the whole situation, which drew their attention to us. They approached us, both glancing me over before turning to the old man.

"Is this the best you could bring us?" the boy asked haughtily. "She doesn't look like she could last a minute in a fight!"

"Hush, Thomas," the girl said quietly. "You cannot see her aura as I can. There is something different about her, an aspect to her aura I have never before seen."

"Yeah, yeah, we start off disliking each other until the first accident on our little quest, at which point we realize that everyone needs everyone else and we all hold hands and sing Kumbaya," I muttered. "So what's this quest all about, anyway? 'Ancient evil' doesn't exactly narrow it down. What're we dealing with? World-eating dragon? Immortal demigod? A boy band?"

The old man gestured us to a table, where a map had been laid out. Pointing to a fortress shaped like a skull - I swear, I could not make this up - and said "Here is the stronghold of the Necromancer of Rek'shan. He has held the world in his grip for generations, only pockets of resistance capable of -"

I interrupted him. "... Capable of standing against him, surviving in secret until true heroes can yadda yadda yadda. Great. Does he have a weakness or anything?"

The old man pointed at the boy. "His sword is forged from star-metal, from the star that fell when the Necromancer rose to power. The planets shall align in mere weeks. Should he be stabbed with this sword in this time, he will be defenseless."

Typical.

_____________________

It took us two weeks to get to the fortress. Two weeks of living outside, not even making a fire so as to hide from... whatever they called the legions of doom or whatever, it was awful. There was a part of me that was glad to be about to fight the Necromancer, if only because it meant we would be inside.

"There are three doors, tests, barriers to entry," said Athgar, the witch-girl, as we slowly approached the main gate. "Legend says that the first door is opened by a test of magic, so I'll be the one to do that. The second door is opened by a test of resolve, so that will probably be Thomas. The third door is a test of knowledge, so... We'll see who can deal with that."

"What, you don't think it'll be one test for each of us?" I asked sarcastically.

"Need I remind you of three days ago," asked Thomas, "when you mistook poison elm for maple when relieving yourself? I hardly think you can be counted on for a test of knowledge."

My retort was cut short by movement at the gate. We had arrived, and the test was beginning. Two large gargoyles flanking the gate came to life at our approach. One opened its mouth to speak.

*If ye seek entry, a test you must pass. Only those strong in magic can succeed.*

Agathar stepped forward. "Let my magic be tested!" she said loudly. The second gargoyle responded.

*Make ye a light to shine into my eyes. But be warned: if the light doth enter my brother's eye, ye shall fail.*

Agathar paled. Turning to us, she whispered "Guys.... I don't know if I can do that... They're so close, anything I do to one would be seen by the other... The only option I'm seeing -"

"Oh for crying out loud, get out of the way," I snapped, bending down to dig through my backpack. Why is it that everything you need falls down to the bottom when you need it?

Standing up, I turned to the gargoyles and aimed my laser pointer directly into the statue's eye. Magic, photon receptor, it's all the same deal. The gargoyles stirred, then returned to their positions alongside the gate.

*Your magic is strong. You may pass.*

The gate swung open.

__________________________

"Okay, the test of resolve," said Thomas. "Seems to be something behind this door, can you hear it?"

I could. It was like a faint screaming. Stepping forward, I put my hand flat against the door.

"Definitely a lot of noise in there. You can feel the vibrations."

"The Hall of Wailing!" Agathar exclaimed. "It's full of banshees.... I thought it was a myth! Supposedly they'll only stop their wailing if someone can open the door at the other end of the hall. They usually drive people insane before then though."

"How do we get me through?" Thomas asked.

"Well, in the stories an ancient druid got through by filling his ears with beeswax, but we don't exactly have any of that... We could try making do with cotton, but... Taylor! What are you do- AAAGGGGHHHH!"

I opened the door and slipped through. Apparently the noise was deafening, even outside. I hoped they would be okay, but for the time being I had bigger things to worry about.

The hall was bigger than I had expected. Must have been two football fields across. Above me I could see the spectral banshees, mouths agape, screaming endless screams. When I finally reached the opposite side and threw open the door, they and their screams vanished into nothingness.

I turned and began to walk back, but my companions were already entering. Apparently their hearing wasn't gone permanently, that was good. I leaned against the doorway and waited for them to reach me.

"By the gods, what were you thinking?" Agathar shouted at me. "You could have been killed!"

"More importantly," said Thomas slowly, "how didn't you?"

I pulled my headphones out of my ears, and reaching into my pocket, turned off my iPod.

"I went through a Scene phase when I was younger. Never cleared this thing off. So I threw on some Evanescence. I figured if you're already listening to one wailing banshee, what're a few more?"

#### [WP] It is illegal to contact the humans, as they wear an evolutionary scar from their time as prey. It is known as "fear" and it makes them volatile and unpredictable.

Score: 1116

Most species in the Council have always been the dominant species of their respective planet. The Garth were the first predators on their planet, and were such efficient hunters that no other predatory species was able to evolve. The Mik'thar, with their hive mind, were able to arrange ambushes that no animal on their world could withstand.

The Terrans, however, are only recently the dominant species. They are a young species, only existing for a thousandth of a galactic cycle, and their dominance has been only a tenth of that. For ninety percent of their existence, they were both predator and prey. They would hunt what they called a "mammoth", while at the same time watching behind themselves to ensure that they were not being hunted by a "sword-tooth tiger". This unique development gave the humans something that no other known sapient species has.

It gave them fear.

I see you whispering amongst yourselves. I imagine what you are saying... "Does he mean to say that we do not feel fear?" You do not understand.

The species of the Council feel fear in the highest levels of consciousness. We determine that there is a way in which an endeavor could fail, and, in hopes that it does not, take action to avoid failure. We call this desire to avoid failure, fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection. On a battlefield, some may experience fear of death, but even that is primarily used to focus on the most reasonable course of action.

The Terrans are different.

Their fear is not the result of higher-level thought determining that something could end badly. Their fear is tied deeply to their evolutionary history, and as such is biological, existing on a subconscious level beyond many Terrans' control. When a Terran feels fear, it is not a tool to seek the most reasonable course of action.

It is a tool to ensure survival.

Fear throws a Terran back into the middle of their species evolution, to the time where every rotation was a struggle for their very survival. The Terrans have many terms to describe this sort of survival struggle. "Dog eat dog", referring to their world's *canis* species, for example. Perhaps most chilling, "Kill or be killed".

Fear for Terrans is not a rational process. This on the screen is a picture of what the Terrans refer to as a "spider". Spiders are generally smaller than a Terran's thumb, and yet it is estimated that five percent of Terrans have a deep-seeded fear of spiders. Other common fears are enclosed spaces, high places, and darkness. None of these are rational fears, and the Terrans themselves admit so. They simply accept the fears as a part of their lives.

It would be one thing if they simply had irrational fears that existed on a subconscious level. Every species in the Council has its quirks. The problem is that their fear runs deep enough, is old enough, that it has affected their evolution. When Terrans feel fear, there is a part of their brain organ that begins to excrete [adrenaline]. Their brains naturally produce combat drugs!

The Terrans feel fear deeper than any other species of the Council, for irrational reasons, and become unpredictable and combative when they do so. It is my proposal, therefore, that we cut all present and future ties with them, for preservation of ourselves.

I am sure you feel the same fear that I do.

The human slid out from under the ship, blinking as he came back into the light. The expression on his face made me worried that I would be stuck here for even longer; I had already been on this technology-forsaken world for half a local rotation, and I had no desire to spend any more time than was absolutely necessary.

"How long's it been since ya put oil in this thing?" he asked.

I blinked.

"Ummm.... In local time...." I quickly punched some numbers into my wristband calculator. "It's been.... two thousand and sixty three rota... days."

The mechanic's eyes widened. "It's been six years since ya got yourself an oil change?! Well there's your problem! Can't imagine the hell you've been puttin' on your engine.... Well that should be an easy fix at least. Mkay, gimme ten."

Before I could ask him what "Ten" meant, he had grabbed a large black bottle and disappeared back under the ship.

A short time later he slid back out and signaled for me to climb into the cockpit. Upon seeing that I was settled, he placed a pair of headphones over his ears and told me to try to start the ship. Once again, I heard the sputtering sound of the hyperdrive failing to complete initiation. I shook my head. Another failure. And this planet was supposed to have the best mechanics.

I turned to thank him for his attempt, only to see that he had climbed up next to the window to stare in at the control panel.

"Whassat blinking light?" he asked.

I looked where he pointed. "That's the hyperdrive light, the whole reason I'm in here in the first place."

"Oh!" he said with glee. "Well why didn't ya say so? I tell ya, people come in here all the time sayin' their stuff don't work and they don't know why, when it's sayin' it right there! So, this light, it's not s'pposed to be blinking, is it?"

"Well.... No," I said, confused. "It's supposed to be solid, but that means there's a problem with the engine."

"Kid," said the mechanic with a laugh. "That ain't an engine problem, that's a computer problem. And there's only one way to fix a computer problem."

He leaned in close.

"Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

#### [WP] A "popular" girl falls in love with a "nerdy" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him

Score: 1102

Samantha couldn’t help herself.  Every boy in the school was chasing her.  A lot of them had already had her and wanted more.  She enjoyed teasing them.  It was all too easy.

&nbsp;

They say forbidden fruit is the finest.  After gorging herself on so much adoration, it was the only thing that Samantha could taste at all.  It was no surprise then that she found herself falling for the first boy who simply didn’t seem to care about her.

&nbsp;

At first she’d assumed it was just because he thought he had no chance with her.  It was true of course, there was no way she’d even bother speaking to a loser like him, she’d thought.  It still irked her that he wouldn’t even throw a glance her way.

&nbsp;

It annoyed her enough that she broke her cardinal rule and actually stooped to speaking to the little mouth breather.  She teased, she flirted, he barely looked up from his textbook.  He was getting good grades, it’s not like he had anything else going for him.  He was distinctly average, no skills, no friends, nothing to make him at all noteworthy.  Yet he somehow thought he could ignore her advances?  This wasn’t going to stand.

&nbsp;

Subtlety went out the window as the months rolled past.  At first she’d been worried that pursuing him would make her look bad in front of her friends.  By the end she didn’t care, this was a point of pride for Samantha and she was going to break his resistance.  They mysteriously ended up in the same group for every project, she sat with him at lunch and tried to strike up conversation, shot him glances across the room and everything else she’d ever read about in Cosmo.

&nbsp;

Rumours started to swirl around the school.  It didn’t take a sharp eye to spot her pursuit of the poor little nerd.  Mixed with the level of envy that constantly swirled around Samantha’s clique it made for an explosive scandal.  Everyone was talking about Samantha and her would-be paramour – everyone but he himself.

&nbsp;

He shrugged off confessions, ignored thinly veiled propositions and just generally remained oblivious.  He had to be doing it on purpose, Samantha decided.  Well, if subtlety – what little she’d exercised – didn’t work, then maybe she’d just come out and say it.  It was social suicide, but what had started as a minor annoyance had wormed its way deep enough into her insecurities that she no longer cared.

&nbsp;

She cornered him behind the bike shed during their lunchbreak.  She’d spent so much time sitting here with him, suggestively playing with the hem of her skirt and the buttons on her blouse while he stared at his goddamn textbooks.

&nbsp;

Samantha took a deep breath and prepared herself to throw away what little dignity she had left.  This had gone on far too long.

&nbsp;

“So, you know how prom’s coming up?” she asked, twirling a loose hair around her finger as she smiled coquettishly at the only man who’d ever resisted her substantial charms.

&nbsp;

“Uh, yeah,” he croaked.  Even his voice was awkward.  It was absurd that he wouldn’t leap at the chance to get with this.

&nbsp;

“Well, I don’t have a date, do you?”

&nbsp;

“Ugggh, no.”

&nbsp;

“So maybe we should go together.  I think you’re super cute.”

&nbsp;

“Er, Samantha, I…”

&nbsp;

“You will!” she excitedly finished the sentence for him, “great!  You can pick me up at six.  I’m going to wear pink, so pick a tux that compliments it, ok?”

&nbsp;

“Uggh, Samantha, I’m…I’m gay,” he finished with an apologetic shrug at the crestfallen cheerleader.

Score: 1098

"Oh no", cried Leltarth, "not on the rug, not on the rug!" 

The bipedal little thing looked quizzically up from the wet patch on the floor, then smiled, burbled, and fell slowly onto its face. Leltarth sighed and gently pushed it upright with one of her spindly insectile limbs. A com-pad nearby began pulsing, informing her that Konnal was checking up on her progress.

"Accept call" she clattered. The misshapen blob looked up with eyes wide, then started to cry loudly. Leltarth rattled her leg spines in frustration, which the creature seemed to find soothing.

"Leltarth, how is your evaluation of the forerunner paleospecies progressing?"

"Not well, I'm afraid. The clone is completely helpless. At first I thought we might have made a mistake, so I went over the reconstruction and cloning transcripts but they're all perfect. But, well..."

"Yes?"

She thrummed her legs nervously as she fought with herself over the controversial hypothesis, the baby staring in rapt attention, apparently fascinated by the gyrations. 

"Konnal, what if their larval form was born with only minimal instincts? What if they didn't have the level of intergenerational memory transfer we take for granted?" 

Konnal remained silent, then cautiously spoke.

"It's an *interesting* idea with some precedents among known pre-sentient species, but do you really think its likely that a civilisation could reach the level of technological sophistication we've seen out there? They'd have to spend..." silence again as he made rough calculations "...the first decade or so of their lives just to become somewhat functional, and even longer to reach a point where they would be contribute to building something like the temples on Ull, or the rings of Nihar." The baby began chewing its own foot.

"That's more or less the conclusion I came to. Can you imagine such a society? The burden of raising each new child? And the fragility of it all! But it could make sense of certain peculiarities we've seen. For example, it certainly sheds a new light on the sheer volume of external recordings they left- if an individual died, anything they had failed to record would be lost. And I think I have some interesting new ideas about their so-called 'temples' which explain their layout and certain artifacts. To me, such sites are starting to look more like places where one generation could train the next. Just an idea at this point of course, but I think it might bear further study"

Konnal mused on his colleague's ideas. They were radical, certainly, but maybe she had a point. But there was a problem, wasn't there?

"Leltarth, this is fascinating but you realise what this means for our original project if true?"

Leltarth whistled sadly.

"Yes. If they did not transfer their knowledge genetically, cloning is a dead-end. We may have to fall back on analysing their written records, which could take centuries."

She turned back and gazed, partly in reverence and partly in disappointment, at the tiny human clone who was busily trying to eat the corner of her desk. It was going to be a long few decades.

#### [WP] A man orders a "cheese pizza with no crust" from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine.

Score: 1075

"*No* crust?" the man grunted back. "You sure?"

"Yeah!" I was slightly drunk, and I found it amusing. At worst, I'd end up eating hot tomato sauce and cheese slop with a fork while watching cartoons. "And make it snappy! I'm hungry." I'd specifically picked the '30 minutes or less' place, though I'm really not too good at telling time when I'm inebriated. 

"You *sure* that's what you want?" 

I hiccuped and confirmed that yes, this is what I wanted. I was giggling, but the pizza place didn't find it as funny as I did.

"All right. Keep an eye out. We'll be dropping it off soon."

I headed back into the living room, which had a perfect view of the street nearby so I could see him coming. I put on Rick and Morty and settled in with another beer. It was anyone's guess as to whether I'd manage to stay awake in the half hour that it would take for them to bring my pie.

--------

I jerked awake at the knock on the door, spilling my beer. *Damn!* There was another knock in rapid succession, and I could see a black SUV waiting in my driveway with the lights on and the engine running. Right. Pizza guy. It all came back to me. I downed what was left of the beer, resolving the clean up the puddle later, and headed to the door. 

The pizza guy wasn't the normal acne-ridden scrawny high schooler. Instead, it was a grown man, maybe 25 or so. He wore all black except for a golden belt buckle and a thick gold chain around his neck that looked like it could have been used to safely secure a golden junkyard gate. All it needed was a padlock. And this guy certainly wasn't scrawny: he was built like a linebacker, probably over 250 lbs. He should be guarding a line outside a nightclub, not running pizzas over here at 2 AM. 

"I got your... pizza... right here," he said, holding up the thin box. There was a giant bulge in the middle of it, stretching the cardboard. And it certainly didn't *smell* like pizza at all. I took the box in my hand to open it up... and there was no pizza in it. Just a ziploc bag full of powdered sugar. 

"This isn't what I ordered, man." My words slurred a bit, and I had to lean against the doorway for support. "Remember? I wanted a pizza with no crust."

He glared at me, glanced around, and pushed the box lid closed again. "Are you fucking crazy?" he growled. "Don't open this out here!" He shoved me through the doorway and followed me inside. "This *is* what you ordered. A *pizza* with *no crust*." He made air quotes and nodded down at the box when he said it. 

I hiccuped again and looked back down at the box in my hands. "Whatever, dude." I was hungry enough to eat a bag of powdered sugar anyway. It didn't sound half bad: maybe I could make some pancakes, though that would risk burning my house down. Which is why I'd decided to order a pizza in the first place.

"So where's the cash?" he asked, filling up the doorway into my kitchen. 

"Oh, right." I reached into my back pocket and pulled out my wallet. I had to blink a few times to separate the ones and the fives from the twenty; everything was starting to blur together. *Shouldn't have had that last beer.* "Here you go!" I held out the $20 toward him; that should about cover it. 

He looked down at the bill, and let out a bark of laughter. Even his *laugh* was mean. I'd have to request the high school kid next time I ordered something from this place. I didn't like this delivery guy. "You've got to be kidding me," he said. From his waistband, he pulled out a pistol and casually waved it in my face.  

We both stared at each other for a moment; I had a bit of a hard time staying balanced. "Ugh, fine," I told him. I slapped another 2 dollars into his hand, even though the 20 should have been more than enough. "Here's a little extra for you. But next time, make sure it's a *real pizza* instead of sugar, man."

He scoffed. "Nice try, pal. That's gonna be $9,000. *This*," he waved the 20 in my face, "isn't quite gonna cut it."

I gave him a dumbfounded look then glanced down at my wallet. I didn't have that much money in there. Nor in my bank account. Nor would I have that much in *years* of saving.

"Well," I responded, pulling out my phone and showing him the time, "Good thing that you all have that 30-minutes-or-its-free guarantee, right?"

I remember dying. It was like watching the world get foggy and fade out. 

Then I was standing in a room with a sign that said **Welcome to Hell!**. The sign was flashing, lighting up in red and traveling around the colors like some sort of Las Vegas Strip joint - catching your eye and blinking. I stood and watched it for a long time before a sharply dressed man came out to meet me.

"Welcome to Hell!" he said. "My name is Sunny, and I'll be your guide today."

"Your name is...nevermind. Hi, Sunny." 

"Hello! If you'll just follow me we can begin our tour!" 

I followed Sunny. He walked with an odd gait - like one leg was longer than the other. He led me through another tunnel and out into a large room with high ceilings around its edges. 

"On your left you'll see our day spa, where you can bask in the glory of hellfire for as long as you'd like. On the right we have our hospital &mdash;"

"Hell has a hospital?" I asked.

"Well of course! It's very up-to-date, we have the latest research and development techniques for the psychological torture of the criminally insane! Now if you look ahead you'll see our space program building &mdash; "

"Wait wait wait. *Space* program? Hell has a *space* program?" 

"Oh yes," the man nodded. "Why Hell is on the forefront of interplanetary travel. We're *this close* &mdash; " he held his thumb and index finger close together " &mdash; to visiting another galaxy. Wouldn't you believe it!"

"How is that possible?" I asked as the man led us past the space program building and down a different street.

"Oh, it's easy. Everyone who believes in evolution ends up here. We've had to make quite an adjustment since Darwin but now we're on the technological forefront of almost everything!"

"Ah," I said as the man led me to another building. 

"And this is our robotics lab. They develop people like me to do the mundane tasks, so that you residents can bask in the hellfire and watch basic cable all day long!" 

I pursed my lips. If Hell had everyone who believed in evolution, I wondered what Heaven would be like.

"Oh God, when will it end?"  Moaned the president, from his bedside, as the First Lady tossed and turned in her sleep.  From above them came a constant buzzing, a chatter that descended upon them, the sounds irregular and jagged.  It was astonishing, really- until recently, man thought that no sound could permeate space.  But the needle like voices of the Floysians seemed to disregard the laws of physics, and their sheer volume cascaded down from miles above, where their small artificial a planet orbited.

At first, it had seemed like a great idea.  The aliens brought new technology, and resources, and production power unheard of in Earth.  They were a valuable asset and had come to the USA *first*.  

"We, the Floysians, have taken great interest in your country, specifically your constitution,". Said the Floysians leader as he shook hands with the president, "And we so admire it that after years of oppression from the other galactic civilizations, we wish to join your country, in a peace keeping manner, for the good of us both."

Of course the president had accepted.  He'd had no choice, reaching out to shake the leader's tentacle with a smile on his face, flinching at the screeching sound of the Floysian's voice.

"We reiterate our admiration for your first amendment- that of free speech.  Truly, it is a progressive notion, and one that has been withheld from Floysians for years."  

*Of course everyone should have a right to free speech,* the president had thought, *the other civilizations must be barbaric*

But that was before he *knew*.

The Floysians were prevented free speech not because of *what* they wanted to say, but rather *how much* they wanted to say.  The noise level from their planet rarely dipped below fifty decibels, and rose each day as new Floysians were born.  And unless America wanted to deny their new citizens free speech, they had no choice but to accept it.

Because the Floysians were never shutting up.

#### [WP] Artificial semen is invented in 2030. By 2100 the male population is extinct. You (a guy) just stepped out of a time machine

Score: 977

I woke up in a dark field. My stomach churned, a side effect of time travel, and I threw up in the grass next to me. The air was dirty and too hot for the evening, and city lights flashed in the distance. I assumed that the scientists accurately placed me outside of the Central Valley in the distant future.  

In 2030 it was discovered that an a chemical, commonly referred to as artificial semen could allow women to reproduce on their own. The ejection of the chemical into a woman's egg altered the egg so that is would successfully divide and ultimately form a near duplicate of the mother. 

Initially the results varied and the discovery was shelved due to the reproduction of clones. Later it was discovered that two women's eggs could be used together with artificial semen to reproduce. The offspring were still only female, but there was greater diversity in the gene pool and the technique spread rapidly. 

Women soon came to realize that they didn't need to uphold traditional standards when it came to family and reproduction. More women began freezing their eggs and devoting themselves to careers and the personal lives rather than traditional marriages. 

While some women still chose to reproduce sexually, many women abstained all together and the male population began to dwindle to almost nothing. 

Many in my time became very concerned and intrigued with the idea of an all female future. As a result, I was chosen to be the first human to time travel to the future to document the results. 

My job was to report to what was called the MCP, a government organization that's job was to track and collect data on the worlds last men. The MCP was founded in my time and the scientist who I worked with hoped it would still be around whenever I woke up. 

I rose to my feet as my stomach settled. I only had a week to collect data until I would hopefully be transported back to the past. I walked quickly. I had nothing except my clothes and a small bag with a few items to document my experience. My plan was to arrive at the MCP before morning, and to attract as little attention as possible. 

It was a few hours before I arrived in the city and I was startled by how many people where still up and active. It had to be nearly one in the morning but the citizens still going about their normal routine. 

Even more odd were the citizens themselves. I expected a city filled with females, yet when I looked into the crowded sidewalks I saw what appeared to be men and women. The clothing and technology was far different from that of the past, but other than that I appeared that nothing had changed. 

I pulled out my logbook and took notes. I questioned if it were possible that society reverted back after all this time. I became less cautious as I realized I would barely stand out in the crowd, even though my clothing was slightly off. 

I continued on my walk to where the MCP main office was located in my time. I was puzzled when I saw that is was still there. Why would the MCP exist if the male population was so large? My questions didn't matter yet, and I walked in the front doors assuming by all the activity outside that it would still be open. The lobby was busy as well, and I approached the front desk were a receptionist met. Her eyes met mine and she smiled politely. 

"Hello ma'am, how may I be of service?" I stopped for a second confused why she would call me ma'am. 

"Hello, I'm here to register as a male." She quickly stopped smiling and a puzzled look spread across her face. 

"You would like to register as a male?"

"Yes," I responded with a short laugh, "that probably seems silly with all the men around here, the MCP probably doesn't even register males any more do they?" The receptionist did return my laugh, instead she picked up a phone on her desk and dialed quickly. 

"Hello, Hanna? I need you to bring down blue team immediately. We have a living human male in our lobby." 



PART TWO



As soon as what I understand to be blue team came out, I was stripped of my belongings and escorted to a back room. 

The first several minutes in the back room were silent as a group of doctors and the receptionist just stared. 

I tried to ask questions but no one would answer instead they shuffled on their feet and took notes about God knows what. 

My mind started racing as I began to question their intentions. I swore the others on the street were male and female. I didn't understand why I was being treated like an alien. I began to panic. What if they knew I wasn't from this time? The scientists in my time were very specific about not revealing my true origin. What if their confusion was because they knew?

I mentally berated myself for being so reckless. What was I thinking coming here so quickly. I didn't even change clothes. 

The door slammed open and a tall woman walked in. 

"Jill, just because she looks different doesn't automatically mean you need to send our bl... Oh my god." Her voice caught in her throat. She walked over to me and placed her hands on my face and turned it back and forth. 

"Jill have you done a full body scan yet."

"No ma'am," the receptionist answered. 

"I need you to go to the lobby and resume business as usual. Don't call anyone and for christs sake don't call Laura. She'll be all over this in 10 seconds flat and I'm tired of her taking any of the interesting cases I get." Jill nodded her head and walked out of the room, quietly closing the door behind her. 

The woman turned her interest back to me and immediately started poking and prodding at my skin. She examined the stubble on my chin that I had missed while shaving and laughed. 

"So you're here to register as a male?" She asked lightly. 

"Yes." I stuttered 

"And are you aware that the last recorded male died 25 years ago?" I took a shallow breath as I shook my head no. 

"He was 87, I was lucky enough to work with him for a short period of time. So excuse me if I find it hard to believe that you, probably in your late 20's or early 30's would just suddenly appear." One of the other doctors brought in what appeared to be a camera and the women in front of me stood me up for photos. While she positioned my arms I tried to work up the nerve to talk. 

"I don't understand," I began to mumble. 

"Understand what?" She responded, now looking me directly in my eyes. 

"There were hundreds of men in streets." She let out a loud laugh. 

"Oh you are strange one," she replied. "Those weren't men you saw, just the latest fashion trend. Some designer recently dug up and old catalog from an old store named Men's Warehouse. Now it's fashionable to wear suits and short hair. Apparently they even have makeup that simulates a beard, my daughter sports a grey one." She laughed again. "Now I need you to hold still, I'm going to check your for any abnormalities or signs of injury."

She began to do a basic checkup. She poked my stomach and I winced. I was still sore from throwing up. 

"Stomach pain?" She asked 

"A little," I responded. She continued on but quickly stopped. 

"Looks like they forgot to empty your pockets," and she reached in and pulled out my wallet. I stopped breathing. My id was in a transparent part of my wallet. I swore that I had left it behind, but now it was in her hands. She quickly glanced over it, her expression never changing, then she placed it in the front pocket of her lab coat. She looked up and smiled at me. 

"We'll place this in the locker with your other things, but for now your initial exam is over. We still have a lot of paperwork to go over before you are registered. Blue team you're dismissed, and you sir can follow me." 

I was in denial, and questioned if she read the id or not. Blue team left the room, and the woman led me out down an empty hallway. We stepped inside an airy office and she closed the door and locked it behind us. 

"I guess I've never introduced my self to you before Mr. Clark, my name is Dr. Ananzi but you can call me Hana." Hana's demeanor was radically different. She no longer smiled, her mood was completely serious. She had clearly read my id. 

"You had my hopes up, but you aren't from here are you?" I shook my head back and forth. She pulled my wallet out of her pocket. "So why are you really here. I assume you didn't come here to be monitored."

Tell us a story about something horrifying, like a murder or mystery in your town. 

^(PM_ME_UR_PMS 12437 points 3 hours ago)  
A couple of years ago, in my home town of Pittsburgh, there was a murder that went unsolved despite what you'd think would be an easy case. It was pretty fucking brutal, actually- this guy, he beat the living shit out of a guy in his forties, smashed his head right in and left it there like ground beef. It was really, really gruesome- my friend was a cop and said it's the single worst thing he's ever seen. No one ever found out who did it, or why, really. But the guess is that it was some kind of drug deal gone south or someone mentally ill who just snapped. 

It's just really scary to think someone can do that and just wander the streets at night.

   >^(throwaway6392976 18526 points 46 minutes ago)  
Okay, I've heard enough of this shit for the past several years, now. I'm routing my IP through a proxy, but I don't even care how risky this is because I'm just tired. I'm tired of seeing people talk about me like I'm crazy, or deranged, or some kind of crazy asshole.

>Moreover, I'm sick of people talking about that fucking piece of shit like he was a victim, like he was just some poor guy that got caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time. His name was Dean Harroway, and I knew him, growing up. Wouldn't call him a friend, but we knew each other. This guy, this fucking prick, he used to joke with me like it was so funny...he'd bump into me sometimes, on my way home from work, so drunk he couldn't stand straight. He'd tell me about... how he was popular with the ladies. The...really young ladies. You see, he was a kindergarten teacher at the local elementary school. I tried to tell the police, but with no proof of anything they just brushed me off. Most people knew him and loved him, thought he couldn't do it.

>But one day, my daughter came home crying, shaking and detached from things she once loved. I'm not saying anything more than that.

>So I took a hammer to his head one night, when he was drunk, alone in his apartment. I smashed that fucker's brains right in, after smashing his kneecaps and fingers and feet to a pulp. And with every scream, I felt vindication. I felt justice for every little girl he'd made scream. 

>I left my family behind, knowing that at least they were safer this way. I traded my life, time with my baby girl, to protect those he harmed. Sure, sooner or later it would've surfaced and he would've gone down...but the law can be slow, sometimes. I wasn't going to let even one more girl get hurt just to do things the nice way.

>Some people don't get the nice way.

The lights on Ambassador Tel’s suspension tank remained static for some time.  Like the rest of his species, his- *it’s* - body was a tangled web of translucent strands like a jellyfish crossed with a ball of yarn.  

In their home waters, under that warm tropical sun, even a mild current had the strength to tear them in two.  This was of course by necessity, forming a crucial part of their reproductive cycle, but left them totally unfit for any sort of non-aquatic travel. 

So for one to undergo the invasive process of suspension, giving up months of their life to be cocooned in a steel tank filled with supportive, tear resistant gel had been my first clue to their desperation.  On a hunch, I had pressed the issue and asked the Ambassador how their recent conflict had been proceeding.

The indicator lights on the Ambassador’s tank stayed static for nearly fifteen minutes.  I was almost to the point of calling one of their aids to check the translation equipment when the lights began to flash and the Ambassador’s synthetic voice spoke.

“Ambassador Stewart, to put it simply, the war has been a catastrophic failure.”

I paused mid sip of my tea, then set the dish down. The directness surprised me, we were so often censored from extra solar affairs.

“Surely it’s not nearly as bad as that,” I responded, “You’re the largest of the local regional powers.  You had the clout to keep us unmolested since we were still building mud huts!”

The lights flashed, “No longer, our control has shrunk to less than one hundred cubic light years.  All that remains are the Home Waters, several extrasolar depots, and you.”

I felt alarm.  A feeling I had not had in a long time.

The lights flashed again, “Before you respond, let me ask you something.”

“Of course.”

“Why do you think we only sponsored your colony on Alpha, as opposed to just giving you the tensor shift mechanism out right?”

The tangent caught be by surprise.  I was still hung up on the thought of what type of enemy could conquer thousands of star systems in a few years time.

“When you contacted us, for the first time that is, you said it was imperative that we maintain our own path of technological development, that if we just borrowed, copied, or stole from others we would just blunt our own ability to innovate.”

The tanks lights lit up in a combination that indicated humor, “We lied.”

“Oh?”

“You’re brutal, short sighted, and violent and we wanted you controlled and suppressed so you didn’t burn across the galaxy like a cancer.”

“Oh,” was all that came out from between the surprise and shock.  

“We’ve watched you for thousands of years and never once have you come anywhere near what the civilized species of this spiral arm call peace.  Even now your General Adi in the South Pacific is butchering his people, and that’s only the most prolific instance of similar acts of brutality across your planet.  Even your most ‘civilized’ countries wage war every other decade!”

My diplomatic training roared back to the forefront of my mind, “Ambassador, these condemnations represent a serious shift in tone from our previous meetings.  While I respect that we have cultural differences-”

“It does not matter,” the Ambassador’s synthetic voice interrupted, ”I’m here to give you the tensor shift mechanism.”

Confused, and with the beginnings of anger at these shifts in the conversation, I coldly asked, “Why?”

A pause before the lights flashed again, “Because our war is about to become your war.  We ask this of you.  We offer the mechanisms partly because you will need it and partly in payment.”

“Payment for fighting your war?” I asked, real anger bubbling through.

“Payment for the right to beg your mercy when it’s all said and done.”

Score: 933

The man stood, teetering on the edge of the bridge. The wind whipped at his coat's lapels and flung his thinning hair around. Another strong gust would push him over, sending him hundreds of feet below into the icy depths of the Trenton River.

I sighed. Another day, another job.

***

Serendipity is the superhero name I chose for myself. Nobody else knows it. Why not? Well, I don't know about you, but I don't have the money or know-how to sew my own fucking superhero costume. I don't have super strength, or super speed, or the power of flight, or telekinesis. As such, I've gotta protect myself and my identity. 

It's not that I believe some supervillain is gonna get me - it's just that I don't want to have to deal with the feds. I would've named myself Anonymous, but I'd rather not associate myself with the dipshits on 4chan.

Anyway, I forgot to tell you what my power actually is. Silly me.

About two years ago, I was out on the school baseball diamond playing catch with my friend. I'd just gotten a new glove and had been dying to test it out. I threw the ball to her, punched my mitt a few times, and raised it to catch her return throw. 

Before the ball met my hand, I heard someone yell, "Rooter! This is comin' to you, bud!"

I whipped my head around, my body and arm turning with it, and a small, soft package landed in my mitt. Just before I could see who threw me the item, or what it even was, the baseball my friend threw thunked me in the head.

It knocked me out.

When I came to, my friend was shaking me urgently.

"Dude! Avery, dude!"

"...Fuck," I groaned, embarrassed that I'd taken my eye off the ball and paid the price for it.

"Dude, why the fuck did you bring that to school? Put it away!"

I looked up at her in confusion, and then down at my mitt, where she was looking. Inside it was a small bag filled with a fine white powder. Flour? 

I opened it up and put my finger in. It didn't feel like flour, and even though the thought was ridiculous, I immediately knew what it was.

"Is that... fucking cocaine?" I asked incredulously to no one in particular.

I stashed the bag in my pocket and tried to explain myself to my friend, but she wasn't having any of it. I lost a friend that day, but I gained something new.

Serendipity.

So yeah, there you have it. For some fucking reason, every time I raise my hand to catch something, somebody, somewhere, yells one of my nicknames and a drug or drink is thrown into my hand. Doesn't matter when or where, or how the law of physics would permit it. 

Quite frankly, I stopped caring a while ago. Unlimited free booze will do that to you.

***

"Just what I needed after a long day," I said to myself with fake enthusiasm. I massaged the bridge of my nose and inhaled deeply. "This fucker better be thankful."

I raised my hand, and right on cue, someone yelled, "Stick! Heads up!" With reflexes honed over the past two years, my fingers closed over yet another soft bag.

It was filled with pre-rolled joints.

"All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic," I half-sang to myself, quoting the Biggie Smalls tune. I flicked on my lighter and took a deep hit. Suicides were always tough.

The weed hit me quick and hard as I strolled over to the railing on the side of the bridge and swung my legs over. The man standing at the edge turned his head and saw me, surprise registering in his eyes.

"Who... who're you?" he asked. "You don't look like a cop."

"I'm not a cop," I replied, grinning. "Fuck the police."

My response must've startled him.

"Then... who are you?"

"I am the walrus," I replied, quoting Donnie from The Big Lebowski. The man continued to look confused. I chided myself for continuing my habit of quoting lines from my favorite songs and movies that most people didn't pick up on.

"Kidding. I'm just an average every day citizen of this fine town, and I was wondering why you're standing here," I said.

"Why do you think?" the man laughed, bitterly shaking his head. "I'm 54, I lost my job, my wife's cheating on me, and my son hates me. There's nothing left to live for."

"Shiiiiiiit," I said, half in response to his situation, half in response to the wave of high that rolled over my body. This was some good weed.

"Yeah, you can say that again," he muttered morosely.

"Shiiiiiit," I said. "Well, why not take a puff before your tragic demise?" I offered him the joint in my hand.

"I've never smoked weed before," he replied, cautiously eyeing it.

"You've also never killed yourself before. Right? First time for everything, man," I laughed, shrugging. I prayed to myself that this would work.

"Fair enough."

The man reached over and gingerly took the lit joint from my hand, sucking on it a bit and coughing.

"Do it softer than that, dude," I said. I couldn't help but chuckle.

The man tried again, this time getting a good lungful of smoke before he started to cough violently.

"Oh shit, nice hit." 

I took the joint from his hand and took another hit. Damn, this was good weed. The man kept on coughing as I tried to blow smoke rings in the blustering wind.

I leaned back against the railing, and my heart leapt as the man mirrored my actions. I hadn't looked down this whole time, but I didn't want to think about falling hundreds of feet to my death. I get free drugs whenever I want, but I wouldn't survive anything like that.

The man turned to me, his eyelids a little heavy, his eyes a little red. He had a goofy half-grin on.

"This makes me feel funny," he chortled.

"That's kinda the point, man," I said. "Anyway, tell me about this bitch of a wife you have."

"Well... Hey, what's your name?"

"Avery."

"Well, Avery, she's not really a bitch. She's just lonely, I guess. She tells me I work too much and-"

I interrupted him. "Being lonely isn't a justifiable reason to cheat, dude. Sorry. Continue."

The man seemed thoughtful for a moment, and forged on.

"Well, she said I worked too much, and that I wasn't filling her needs. So she had a fling with a younger guy from her work."

"Fuckin' bitches, man. Can't trust these hoes," I said, hoping he'd pick up on the slang I was using.

He laughed again.

"Yeah, I guess not," he said. "She was kind of annoying anyway. And she'd never give me a blowjob."

I guffawed, surprised at his last statement. I tried to stop and make some witty remark, but the weed took its hold on me, and soon I was laughing so hard tears were forming in my eyes. The man seemed like he couldn't help but laugh either, and soon we were both doubled over on the side of a bridge hundreds of feet above a churning, over-polluted river, sharing a joint and watching thousands of people pass us by without a second glance.

We continued on, just laughing, and pausing, and then bursting into laughter again until the sun began to dip below the horizon.

"Damn, that's really cool," the man said, watching the giant burning ball of gas's rays illuminate our atmosphere in hues of pink and purple.

"Yeah man," I said, taking another hit of the joint. **Damn**, this was some good weed.

"Hey Avery?" the man asked. I turned to him.

"Yeah?"

"I'm really hungry."

I smiled and reached over to smack his shoulder. "Let's go get something to eat, man."

FADE IN:

EXT. A TRIBAL MEETING GROUND - NIGHT

*Several figures huddle around a campfire. The flickering light reveals that half of the individuals are humans, whereas the other half are cat-like creatures. One of these latter beings rocks back and forth in place, staring at a silver box in front of him. This is HMRRH, a chieftain.*

**HMRRH:** Let me make sure that I understand this. When I speak, this... thing... listens to me, then allows you to understand me.

*One of the humans nods. This is BARTLET, a diplomat from Earth.*

**BARTLET:** That's correct. It also translates my words into your native tongue.    
**HMRRH:** Interesting. Thank you for clarifying.    
**BARTLET:** Are you interested in how it works?    
**HMRRH:** Not really, no.

*Bartlet looks slightly shocked by this.*

**BARTLET:** Are you sure? It's actually pretty fascinating.    
**HMRRH:** Yes, I'm sure it is. Maybe you can discuss it with our shaman later.    
**BARTLET:** "Shaman?"    
**HMRRH:** Apparently it can't translate everything.    
**BARTLET:** No, no, I know what a shaman is. I just don't understand why you'd want me to talk to one.    
**HMRRH:** Well, it's kind of her job. Anyway, I'm much more intrigued by stories from the other side.    
**BARTLET:** "Other side?"    

*Hmrrh points skyward.*

**HMRRH:** You know. Up there. Where the dead people go.    
**BARTLET:** Oh, gosh... this is awkward.    
**HMRRH:** What?    
**BARTLET:** We didn't come from any kind of "other side." We're from another world.    
**HMRRH:** Yes, I'm aware.    
**BARTLET:** Then what's all this about dead people?

*Hmrrh scrapes his teeth against themselves. The translator box emits a fair approximation of laughter.*

**HMRRH:** I didn't realize I'd be sharing such common knowledge with my creator!    
**BARTLET:** What?    
**HMRRH:** You see, every creature has a light within them, visible in their eyes. When their bodies cease to function, the light escapes and travels upward. Even now, you can see these sparks in the night sky.    
**BARTLET:** Sorry, what was that about "creator?"    
**HMRRH:** Everyone knows that creators often live amongst the dead. Some have argued that creators *are* the dead, and that they live in reverse from those on the ground.    
**BARTLET:** "In reverse?" I'm sorry, something must be wrong with this thing.

*Bartlet lightly kicks the translator box.*

**HMRRH:** Consider: A person is born, and their light begins to glow when they first open their eyes. When they die and their light departs, it is no longer bound by the rules of this world. It may exist at all places and times at once, even before it came to be.    
**BARTLET:** That's... actually a fairly advanced concept in physics.    
**HMRRH:** I'll take your word for that. To continue, though: Since a creator can see their work before it is complete, they are therefore able to devise its creation. We call this "inspiration." Those who would be creators often function best when they can see the lights of those who are above them.    
**BARTLET:** I have to confess, that makes sense in a weird way.    
**HMRRH:** So, it's correct, then? You come from the land of the dead?

*A moment of awkward silence passes, during which time Bartlet looks uncomfortable.*

**BARTLET:** Okay, look, I'm just going to be blunt: Those lights up there are stars. They're not dead people. My friends and I came from a planet that orbits one of those stars.    
**HMRRH:** Which one?    
**BARTLET:** It's not visible at the moment.    
**HMRRH:** I see. Or rather, I don't. 

*Hmrrh scrapes his teeth together.*

**HMRRH:** (*CONT'D*) Go on.    
**BARTLET:** Right. Well. There are more stars than anyone could ever hope to count, and many of them have planets around them. It's difficult to get from one planet to another, though, because the distance between them is enormous.    
**HMRRH:** I'm not hearing anything that refutes what I've told you.    
**BARTLET:** What?    
**HMRRH:** You came a great distance from a spark of light in the sky. As I have already told you, the sparks need not conform to the rules that governed them in life. Furthermore, you say that there are more of these sparks than can be counted, just as there are more people than can be numbered.    
**BARTLET:** That's not...    
**HMRRH:** (*Interrupting*) Besides, now that we know creators can retake physical forms after death, well... one can only imagine how much life must be out there.    
**BARTLET:** There's that "creator" word again. You do know that I'm just like you, right?

*Once again, Hmrrh scrapes his teeth together.*

**HMRRH:** Yes, I'm well aware. Again, though, consider: Your life was given to you by a spark in the sky, was it not?    
**BARTLET:** In a way, yes, but...    
**HMRRH:** (*Interrupting*) And that spark has doubtlessly existed for far longer than your... planet, was it?    
**BARTLET:** Yes.    
**HMRRH:** So, the spark was once a life - perhaps one not even born yet - which gave rise to more lives. They, in turn, became light again, then once more became life. This is a power reserved for those who can create. Thus, you are a creator.

*Understanding finally dawns on Bartlet's face.*

**BARTLET:** Oh! Oh, I think I see. You're not saying I'm *your* creator; just *a* creator.    
**HMRRH:** No, no, you are my creator.    
**BARTLET:** What?

*Hmrrh places a clawed hand on Bartlet's wrist.*

**HMRRH:** I have claimed you as my own. Worry not, though: I have no plans to keep you here.    
**BARTLET:** I'm so confused.    
**HMRRH:** This much is evident. Please, have some rest. No doubt our shaman will wish to discuss your magic with you tomorrow.

*Hmrrh stands and leaves a bewildered-looking Bartlet near the fire. He walks away from the lit area, and encounters a second member of his species. This is SCISSHS.*

**SCISSHS:** That was painful to overhear.    
**HMRRH:** Be patient with them. As you know, creators are often too enchanted with their own works to know the ways of the world.    
**SCISSHS:** That's one explanation.    
**HMRRH:** Have you another?    
**SCISSHS:** Isn't it obvious?

*Scisshs looks over at the firelight, watching as Bartlet awkwardly shares food with the others. He spills some on himself and flaps his arms with a comical motion.*

**SCISSHS:** (*CONT'D*) Gods are just stupid.

FADE OUT.

"All right," Dean thought, putting the helmet on. "I hope this works."

By his side, the stray dog tried unsuccessfully to remove his own helmet.

Dean pressed the 'Converge Conscience' button and closed his eyes. He felt a jolt of electricity going through his 
body, and then everything went dark.

Then Dean opened his eyes, and suddenly he was watching the room from very different point of view. He was watching everything from four feet off the ground.

"Yes!" Dean thought, amazed that the incredibly fishy-sounding device he bought off of a Craiglist's announcer by the username 'Dude-with-cool-stuff' had worked. "Yes, it worked!"

"Dude, what's going on?" a voice sounded in his head.

*Huh… that's weird.*

Dean lifted the dog's front paw and pulled the helmet off of his newly acquired canine head. He barked once, just for the fuck of it.

"Hey! I didn't bark! Who barked?"

That voice again…

"Wait, what's going on?" Dean asked himself internally.

"Dude, what the hell?" the voice answered.

"Who are you?"

"I'm Barkie. Or… I don't know. That was the name they gave me at the pound, before I escaped. Who the hell are 
you?"

"Oh shit," Dean thought. "You're the dog?"

"Yeah, I'm the God-damned dog. Who are you!?"

"I'm the guy who bought a device from a crazy scientist to transfer my conscience into a dog's head," Dean 
thought-replied.

"Oh. Okay. I don't understand anything you just said, but can we go out and find some food?" Barkie replied. "I'm hungry. I'm usually hungry. Like, all the time. It's weird, right? I wonder if other dogs are always hungry too. You know where we can find food? Should we look for some trashcans we can turn over? What do you think?"

*Shit… this is going to be hard.*

&nbsp;

Dean walked himself out of the house and looked around the street. He started for Beverly Hills, where Ed now lived.

"Hey, human dude, where are we going?"

"Shut up, stupid dog."

"Is there food where we are going? I'm kinda hungry. Have I said that already? I feel like I said that already. Don't get me wrong, it's just that I don't usually have anyone to talk to. I mean, I bark to other dogs, but that's pretty much it."

Dean ignored the dog. Okay, this wasn't part of the plan. The dog being able to communicate with him was 
definitely not something he expected. Still. He was going to go through with it. The plan remained the same.

He was going to find Ed and kill the shit out of him for what he had done to him back at the Warehouse. Then he 
was going to find Murphy and Tracy and all the others and do the same to them. Talking dog or no talking dog.

"Dude, are you thinking about killing people?" Barkie's voice sounded in his head. "That's not cool, dude. I don't wanna kill people."

"Shut up. Let's just keep walking."

They would pay. All of them. And Dean would get away clean, because, well, who on Earth would believe that a 
man transferred his mind to a dog so he could kill his ex-partners in crime and not go to jail? That sounded like 
something out of that weird Writing Prompts forum Dean visited sometimes.

Dean reached Ed's house just as Ed was stepping away and heading for his car. A God-damned Lamborghini. That 
bastard had double-crossed Dean and taken all the money for himself, and now he was driving a Lambo! The asshole!

"All right… steady now, Barkie…"

"Dude, seriously, don't bite the guy to death. That's so not cool. Let's just find some beef jerky. I love beef jerky. They have it at the trashcan behind the Seven Eleven near --"

"Shut up. I get to control the body, not you."

"Come on, man, he seems like a nice guy. I don't wanna kill humans. Humans are awesome. They play fetch with 
you and they give you food and –"

"Shut up!"

Ed was almost by his car. Dean took a deep breath, pulled back and charged for –

**"Cat! Cat! Cat!"**

"What?" Dean thought-exclaimed. "What are you talking abou –"

But Dean was no longer in control. Against his will, the dog's body charged in the opposite direction, heading for 
what appeared to be a Siamese cat by the neighbor's mailbox.

The cat spotted Dean and, in a quick movement, turned back and made a run for it.

"We'll get him, man, we'll get him!" Barkie yelled, as they doubled their speed.

"Stop, you idiot! I don't wanna get the cat!"

"But we must get him! He's the cat! We must get the ca – aaw, shoot, he climbed over the roof. How do cats 
climb so high?"

Dean sighed internally. He noticed he was panting hard. The cat disappeared over the edge of the roof. Dean turned back. Ed was inside his Lamborghini already, and a second later, took off down the suburban road.

"God damn it," Dean thought to himself. 

"How do they do it? It's amazing," Barkie thought. "I can't climb the freaking stairs without fearing for my life and 
these cat dudes are all over the place jumping everywhere." He paused. "I guess that's why they get all the 
Youtube attention. Damn, I wish I was a Youtube star. Those guys have it easy."

"God damn it, you stupid dog, you let Ed get away!" Dean thought-yelled. "Because of a stupid cat!"

"Yeah! Cats are stupid!" Barkie agreed, excitedly. "Come on, let's go around the house and get him!"

"No, that's not what I – God damn it, is this thing malfunctioning? Why are you in control now? Stop it, I don't 
want to chase a cat, I don't –"

But they were halfway around the house already, and Barkie was thinking "Catcatcatcatwhereisthecatcatcat" on 
repeat.

"I hate my life," Dean thought, bitterly.

**"CatcatacatCAT! FOUND THE CAT! I FOUND THE CAT DUDE, LET'S GO!"**

And off they went again.

I had kneeled in this ashen cemetery for countless years, the coiled sword keeping the darkness inside me contained. Contained, that is, until it was removed by this ashen knight.
"Champion", he had called himself.
Many had called me by that title, in ages past.
The body of this contender remained still, unmoving. Usually, when the undead were killed, their ashes would fade, and they would be reborn nearby, ready for another attempt to defeat me. Yet this Champion remained still. In the sky, the sun had faded to almost nothing, its fire nearly gone. 
Shifting the halberd in my hand, I stepped forward, pushing aside the great doors that I had guarded for so long. I made my way up the path, entering the dark shrine with purpose. As I drove the coiled sword into the unlit bonfire, I knew what needed to be done. If the Champion of Ash would not seek out the Lords, then I, the Champion of old would see it done.

I bowed my head and looked at my hands. I fiddled with my fingers. I heard my companion lean back in her chair. 

"That is an... interesting request."

I looked back up. She had one leg crossed over the other, one arm draped over the back of the chair. The thumb on her hand not clutching the chair was between her teeth. 

Considering what I'd just asked her to do, she was hideously casual. She looked like she was mulling over what she wanted for dinner.

"I'll talk to my superiors."




Every one of our councilmen had gathered, plus one human. We watched out windows and on displays as our enemies approached, their ships painted with bright streaks and images of death. We blanched. Our human companion sipped her drink. A tiny smirk crossed her face.

"They have no idea what they've done."

Our city was perfectly still, pale buildings reaching upwards higher than any human building. It looked dead already. We looked beaten. They didn't stop.

"Open fire."

The order was icy cold. Everything they did was cool and calculated and cunning.

*crack*

The first tremendous slug from their ships came from above. It slammed into the flagship at over 60,000 kilometres per hour. She collapsed inwards, towards the hole torn through her hull. And then she fell, slow and burning, from the sky. I heard later she landed in a shallow lake in the middle of a public park.

We heard the sound of the slug hitting our pavements, followed by the flagship hitting the ground.

*crack, crack, crack*

The slugs no longer made individual noises. So many were fired at once, it was like a hailstorm.

Ships fell. The few troops who landed alive were torn apart by humans who willingly threw themselves from their ships with nothing but a small propulsion jet to slow their descent. The fleet our enemies had sent was destroyed utterly in less than 40 seconds.

The human in the chamber sipped her drink again.

"That's it? I guess we got them by surprise." Everyone else was silent.


World after world fell, and we reclaimed them. The humans had no interest in taking our cities for themselves. They slaughtered the enemy, gave the all-clear, and left. Every time, without fail. They took back all our worlds, but by that point, it wasn't just pest control anymore. It was *their* war now. They pushed to worlds that weren't ours or anyone else's to reclaim. They expanded their territory right around ours. What had once been a defence force was now a full-blown invasion. They chased and chased. Cold and calculated. Circling, striking, taking what they wanted and destroying everything else. The homeworld was nearly reached before we'd even begun to recover.


"Call them back." His huge eyes bulged out of his bowed head as he kneeled before us. "Call the humans back. You've taken what's yours." The council talked among themselves.

"The humans... are acting of their own accord. There is nothing we can do for you."

*"We have made a terrible mistake."*

#### [WP] A "popular" girl falls in love with a "nerdy" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him

Score: 865

"For the last time Samantha, cut it out! This is getting so weird!"

The girl withdrew her hand from the boy's arm, hurt flooding her eyes even as she brushed her dark hair away from her now bright blue, speckled skin and then huffed with frustration.

"Sam, come on. No one has been into Avatar since like, 2011. And how long did you spend on that weird blue alien costume anyways?"

"Na'vi." The girl corrected him mechanically, reflexively.

"Okay, Na'vi -- whatever. Either way, showing up at my place in these outfits... it's got to stop. Weren't you dating... what's his name, Brad? Kyle?"

"Derek, his name was Derek. We're not together anymore." Sam's voice was soft and quiet as she supplied the name, her gaze downcast at her feet.

"Look, Sam, we used to be kind of friends. I mean, we didn't hang out and you share NO interests with me, but it was fine having you around the gang. Can't we just go back to that? Showing up in dirty storm trooper outfits isn't--"

"Sand trooper." Again, the correction was automatic; mechanical and fast.

"Right, right. Sand troopers. Those are the ones from.. uh..." Mark paused, his brain blanking on which Star Wars the trooper variant had first appeared in.

"A New Hope."

Sam supplied to answer so easily and smoothly that it caused Mark to pause, and he looked back at her blue, artfully done face with suspicion and a sudden spark of insight.

"Released?" He queried.

"1977."

"Produced by?"

"Gary Kutz, but Rick McCallum did the special edition."

"What was the character name for the opera singer in Fifth Element?"

"Diva Plavalaguna."

"In what movie are ancient mythologies the result of alien interference in early human history?"

There's a momentary pause now by Sam, but the lapse is fleeting before her eyes flash with challenge and she angles her chin at the boy standing in front of her defiantly.

"Stargate, 1994, directed by Roland Emm--"

"WOW Sam! You're a total NERD!"

Mark dissolved into a fit of wild laughter, and if her face hadn't been covered in paint he would have seen the furious blush that bloomed over Sam's pretty features. She shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as he regained his composure, leaning against the doorframe of his front door, wiping tears of humor from his eyes.

"Have you been HIDING that all these years?"

Sam's mouth worked silently for a moment, trying to drudge up words stuck in her throat before she finally pushed them out past her lips.

"YES! Okay?! Are you happy? I-I like you so much because you like all the things I like! But my parents always said that Star Wars and Alien and Iron Man were things meant for boys, not pretty little girls in dresses. And then, well, then I was in cheerleading and they would have made fun of me! But when we graduated that all stopped mattering and I-I-I---!"

She was near tears herself now, but not the same mirthful kind Mark had shed. Seeing this his features dropped into guilt and he pushed away from the door frame, tentatively laying a hand on her arm.

"Okay! Okay, I get it Sam. Come on; lets watch a movie or something. You're going to have to sit on a towel though, I don't want that blue stuff all over my couch."

"Thanks Mark. Really, thanks."

"Don't mention it, Sam. Like really, don't mention it. You're totally going to mess up my street cred with the gang."

She was giggling now as he gently directed her past him, into the apartment and the closed the door with a muffled click.

#### [WP] - You are an angel of heaven. Angels are tasked with creating animals to populate the earth. You are called into God's office to discuss your finished project - the platypus.

Score: 863

Kabshiel waited in the hall to be ushered into the Presence.  He was worried; this would be the first time being unexpectedly summoned, and he wondered what he might have done to warrant this attention from the LORD.  Rapt in thought, and concerned that his actions might somehow be counter to the praise the LORD may want, he didn't notice Adnoai until the archangel was nearly upon him.

"He is ready to address you, Kabshiel," the mighty prince of Heaven said to him.

"Is it bad?  Please brother, tell me.  I only wish to know how I might have offended our Father."

"The Mind of our Father is not known to me in this matter brother.  I'd hedge on the idea that you are well and truly fucked though."

With a heavy sigh, Kabshiel straightened up, adjusted his robes, and set forward to prostrate himself before the Throne of Heaven, and receive the guidance and orders of the LORD.  Standing before the magnificence of the Presence alone for the first time in his long existence alone, he trembled before the might of His being, the attention of the Lord of Creation turned and focused solely upon his form.  The power was overwhelming, and was nearly crushed by the force of that great Will.

Prostrate, Kabshiel said, "Oh God, My God, Father of All, Lord of the Heavens and Earth, Creator of Creation itself, I am humbled before your presence and have prost-"

"GET UP.  THIS IS AN OFFICIAL VISIT, BUT WE CAN DISPENSE WITH THE FORMALITIES.  ONCE AGAIN, MY BELOVED SON, YOU'VE CAUGHT MY ATTENTION."  Unnerved by the interruption and breaking of protocol, Kabshiel slowly, cautiously stood up and risked to look upon the Presence.

"Father, hae I displeased you?"

"KABSHIEL, YOU'VE BEEN DOING WORK ON THE GREAT SOUTHERN ISLAND UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT OF SANDALPHON.  YOU IMMEDIATELY SHOWED CLEVERNESS WITH YOUR WONDERFUL CREATION OF THE WALLABY.  IT IS A BEAUTIFUL AND CLEVER CREATURE, AND WAS SO ADMIRED THAT SANDALPHON IMMEDIATELY TASKED NAYA'IL WITH TESTING A LARGER VERSION WITH THE KANGAROO.  THIS PLEASED ME, AS I AM SURE YOU REMEMBER FROM THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE BROUGHT TO MY PRESENCE."

"Yes, of Father of Wisdom."

"OH SHIT, JUST CALL ME BY MY NAME.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TIRING THESE NEW TITLES YOU LOT KEEP COMING UP WITH CAN BE."

"Of course-"

"ANYWAY, YOU AGAIN SHOWED THAT YOU HAVE HIDDEN BEAUTY IN YOU WITH YOUR NEXT OVERSEEN CREATION, THE CASSOWARY.  IT HAS VIBRANT COLORING IN ITS FACE, AND IS BOTH MAJESTIC IN ITS PRESENCE, WHILE DARINGLY MADE AS A FLIGHTLESS BIRD.  THOSE AREN'T VERY COMMON, YOU KNOW, AND MAY TEND OT BE PRETTY SPECTACULAR FAILURES.  THE FACT THAT IT STANDS UP WITH THE OSTRICH WHILE NOT BEING AS STUPIDLY RIDICULOUS AS THE EMU SAYS A LOT ABOUT YOUR TALENT.  LOVE THE EMU THOUGH; IT'S SO STUPID."

"Thank you, My Lord-"

"THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO USE MY NAME.  ANYWAY, I NEARLY HAD IT IN MIND TO HAVE YOU WORK HAND IN HAND WITH RAPHAEL, YOUR CREATIONS WERE SO PLEASING.  HE'S BEEN DOING WONDERFUL THINGS WITH INSECTS, BUTTERFLIES PARTICULARLY.  SO, I ORDERED SANDALPHON TO LET YOU TRY YOUR HAND AT YOUR FIRST UNGUIDED CREATION."

"Yes, and thank you for the chance to let me prove mysel-"

"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU MAKE HERE?  WHAT IS THIS?"  Upon this divine utterance, a small, furry form plopped into existence in front of the Divine being, at the foot of the Throne of Heaven, in the Temple of the Lord, at the middle of Heaven, in the Center of Creation.

"Well, I haven't come up with a final name yet, but I'm leaning towards 'Platypus'."

"HAD YOU PARTAKEN OF ASMODEI'S MUSHROOMS BEFORE PUTTING YOUR WILL TO WORK?  THIS THING FOLLOWS NO RULES WHATSOEVER.  YOU'VE MADE A FURRY, FLIGHTLESS BIRD THING THAT IS ELECTROSENSITIVE.  AND POISONOUS.  AND UNBELIEVABLY AGGRESSIVE.  IS IT EVEN A BIRD?  IT LAYS EGGS.  I HAVE WISDOM BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION, MY CHILD, BUT EVEN I CANNOT FATHOM WHY YOU WOULD JUST SLAP THIS FUCKING THING TOGETHER LIKE YOU DID.  PLEASE, ENLIGHTEN ME."

Dumbfounded, Kabshiel opened and closed his mouth a few times, reminiscent of a dying fish, before mustering enough self-awareness to say, "Well, Lahiel had been doing wonderful things with monitor lizards, and he even made a tank of a beast with a nose protrusion made of fingernails!  I had hoped to please you with my imagination,-"

"IT'S FUCKING WEIRD.  IT DOESN'T MATCH THE THEME OF YOUR ASSIGNED LOCALE.  THINGS HERE ARE DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL, NOT JUST UNUSUAL.  YOU NAILED THE SECOND EDICT SPOT ON, BUT SERIOUSLY."

"I had seen so many violent creatures on the Southern island.  So many things with lethality hidden under their beauty and majesty.  I had only hoped to provide a creature with mercy in its being, devoid of the seeming cut-throat malice so prevalent in the fauna there.  Heck, even a lot of the flora wants to kill everything around it.  The poison was to give it a means of defending itself and thriving as a testament to the wonder of Your grace, that even in a landscape so harsh, peace can be found in a creature such as this."

"WHY IS IT SO WILDLY AGGRESSIVE THEN?"

"Sandalphon insisted upon it, Lord.  She said it had to be, to meet the requirements You had laid down for her."

The Lord's demeanor softened from displeasure into compassion for His child.  "I SEE NOW, MY CHILD.  YOU HAVE TRULY SHOWN INSIGHT INTO MY PLAN.  GET RID OF THE WILD AGGRESSION; IT LOOKS FAR TO SILLY TO BE A MURDER MACHINE LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW.  SOFTEN UP THE FUR, AND MAKE IT PERSONABLE AND FRIENDLY TO MY CHERISHED CREATION MAN, AND YOU CAN KEEP IT."

With joy radiating from his very being, Kabshiel exclaimed, "Oh thank you Lord!  I had hoped you would be pleased!"

"OK, OK, CALM DOWN.  AND MAKE ME ANOTHER CUTE THING FOR THERE.  THE PLACE SORELY NEEDS IT."

"I think I know just the thing, Father!  I've been playing around with an idea that might fit the bill.  I'm hesitantly coining it the Koala..."

"I didn't mean anything by it!"

The human screwed up his face. "What's that?"

"I... I didn't mean anything!"

He tilted his head to one side. Oh my Simulator! Was that a sign of aggression?

"I didn't mean anything!"

"Anything... by what?" he asked. "I only asked what you were looking at. Was it the TV? This is my favourite show," he said. "Have you seen it?"

I stepped back. "I didn't see anything!" I said.

"Dude," the human said.

What was a dude? Would it come and claim my foetuses? They were gestating in my sac. How could I protect them? I'd only just accepted them from their mother. How could she forgive me?

He pointed at the screen. "The show. Have you seen it? It's great. It's about a cop. He plays by his own rules, but he gets the job done. You know?"

"By his..." I stuttered, "... *own* rules? Not the rules of the Law?"

He nodded, sipping a filthy brown liquid from an open container. "His *own* rules. Look at this bit. Best episode ever."

I turned my attention to the screen in deference to him. Perhaps this show of obsequious powerlessness would quell the raging fires of violence within him. Lit up by the primitive lights, I saw a human strike - strike! - another human in the face and demand to know where a missing child was. The victim of this crime asserted that he knew not where the missing child was; yet the first human struck him again. Again!

I turned away.

"The vehicle," I said. "When..." I cleared one of my throats. "When will it be ready?"

The human stepped towards me. I tried, how I tried! I tried not to flinch. The Discussion Warriors of Planthentintrix would have been proud of me. I belonged on the Stern Debating Battlefield of Fharginord alongside them - and if my salient argument should fail to stand up to cross-examination? Then to rest in the Eternal Fields of the Fallen.

"Give it an hour," the human said. "It's only a blown flange. We'll have it taped back up. It'll get you to Alpha Centuraui."

I laughed with relief. "An hour?" I asked, incredulous.

"Sure," he said. "If that. Oh, look! Look! Watch this bit. It's great."

The human on the screen raised a weapon to his victim's knee-joint. He demanded to know where the hostage was again. I gripped my abdomen in fearful anticipation. My foetuses quivered beneath. The victim, excreting droplets of effluent in fear, somehow explained where the missing child was.

"How did he come by this information?" I asked.

The human looked up at the screen. "What?" he asked. "Dude, he knew all along. He was the guy that took him."

Such deceit! Such wickedness! Packaged as entertainment and presented as enjoyment! Such...

The human on the screen hit the child-taker with the butt of his weapon. At this point, I kind of felt like he deserved it. 

"What will he do now?" I asked.

The human looked at me, the corners of his mandible-less feeding hole turning upwards. "He's going to get the kid back," he said.

"Playing by the rules?" I asked, my voice tremulous.

"What?" he asked. "No, man. Of course not."

I relaxed, confused, and docile. "Dude," I said. "That's awesome."

"It's a Tuesdayyy!" Sang LuciLeo before work to LumiLeo, "You know what that means? My night with the wife! And it's gonna get *kinky*."

They were in their apartment, a one bedroom on the seedier side of town where their chance of meeting a friend was nonexistent. LuciLeo smoked a cigar on the couch with one hand, a handle of jack in the other, while LumiLeo sipped red wine and flipped a page of his book. 

"You know," said LumiLeo, "I think she enjoys the sweet loving more. You're just jealous your methods can't compare."

"And you're just jealous today is my day for bangin, and your day for workin." Retorted LuciLeo. 

He was right, of course. According to their calendar, which LumiLeo had made since he was the more trustworthy of the two, even to LuciLeo, LumiLeo had work duty. That meant while LuciLeo had the day off, LumiLeo would step into the office and do what he did best- inspire his coworkers, compliment his boss, and complete his deliverables. Tomorrow, LuciLeo would return and put the fear of God back into his underlings, take the boss out for strippers and booze, and fudge some numbers. It was the ultimate combination, the perfect good cop / bad cop. 

And since the incident, only six months before, they'd been promoted twice. Adding that to LuciLeo's drug dealing, their salary had quadrupled. 

But that wasn't the only place their life has improved. 

Their sex life was off the charts, the wife never knowing what to expect. LuciLeo learned to shred on the guitar, and his band had already been headlining at a few of the seedier clubs. LumiLeo estimated he was halfway to enlightenment. 

And now it seemed strange to both of them, that when they were combined, they had always thought the other held them back.

"Okay, let me have it."

Not quite what I would have expected coming out a kid. Sitting in the hospital bed, kid looks like ET. The picture they used when they proposed this whole idea...it was a lot more flattering. His head didn't look so...big.

"Cadeceus?"

The woman to my right, dark haired a nice rack that made her reporters badge just sway in ehen she turned. Oh right, the reporters. My publicist said it would be great publicity once I told her about my powers. I'm a healer, pretty damn valuable honestly, like a unicorn. But only if I punch someone. And not halfheartedly, I've got to punch them **really** hard like I hate them. When I told her the specifics she went white as a sheet. She jumped the gun; organized an healing event. 

Cancer ward at the local children's hospital. I was legally obligated to punch the cancer our of these children. Now all these people were waiting for me to go Muhammed Ali on a bunch of terminal children. As I looked at the kid, Ethan (?) was his name. Big old coke bottle glasses, staring up at me like a puppy. 

A poor terminally ill puppy, kept on staring at my namesake, the red caduceus symbol on my chest. Or maybe just my chest.

"Kid," I say with a forced smile, "this is going to hurt me a lot more than you."

The first blow knocked him out of the bed. That got some instinctual gasps out of the crowd, given they could hear the air snap. I got on top of him as soon as I could and landed another one square in the nose. It was always jarring putting all my force into the punch only to see nothing happening.

He started flailing a bit with the next few, so I--holy crap! The little turd actually tried to cop a feel! "Now you're going to get it." I growled.

It stopped being coordinated. I just wailed on him as hard as I could. Started hitting him faster and faster as the color started coming to his face for the first time in years, the hair that started coming for the first time, the soft cries being replaced by giggling. Now that? That just made me angrier.

But I'm no athlete honestly. I tired out in maybe a few minutes. Looking at him on the floor...the picture of health. Doctors actually clapping, the reporters cameras flashing. Some actually congratulating the kid, who was looking at me with a smile on his face.

I'm going to have to invest in a sandbag.

They're going to call in about my transfer, so you need to use the communications jammer, right? Remaining undetected is the most important thing."

Han, standing to the right in full stormtrooper getup, nodded. Luke standing on the left side had no idea what Chewie was saying, but he didn't need to: Han had already explained the plan. At least, Chewie *hoped* he had. Even when he was willing to translate, it seemed like orders somehow got garbled. Chewie couldn't speak Basic so he wasn't sure if Han was translating correctly, but part of him was beginning to think that Han wasn't as fluent in Shyriiwook as he claimed to be.

The doors swished open, and Chewbacca entered the detention bay flanked by the two 'stormtroopers.' He clasped his hands together, pretending they were cuffed. 

"Woftushpo ofp hufutrumnes?" the human officer asked, eyes darting between Chewbacca and Han. 

*Play it cool, Han,* Chewbacca thought. The imperials would be suspicious if he spoke to a Stormtrooper, so he had to stay silent for now. And he had to rely on Han's improvisational skills, which was always a perilous gamble.

"Fulterhesto hogjowbiga moahwe tha ame no pa," Han replied, nodding toward Chewie. The imperial officer's eyes narrowed, and Chewie's heart skipped a beat. Something was wrong. The human suddenly gestured to the guards behind him, who ran forward with weapons drawn. Then he reached for the communicator. *Damn it!*

"Use the jammer, Han!" Chewie roared, knocking away the guard that came close. Gunfire richocheted around the room as both groups opened fire. Luke tossed Chewie a weapon, and he quickly dispatched one of the black-helmeted prison guards. "We need the officer alive though in case someone comes to investigate!"

Right as Chewie finished his sentence, Han shot the imperial officer in the chest, and he crumpled into a heap over the console. "IDIOT!" Chewbacca berated Han. "At least shoot out the cameras, then!" He aimed his own weapons at the various sensors around the room. That should buy *some* time. 

Finally the room was silent. Han rushed over to the beeping console and managed to silence it... but then began speaking into it.

"What the hell are you doing?" Chewie whispered, not wanting to be heard by whoever was on the other end. Han didn't listen, though. He kept babbling in Basic nonsense, until finally he got frustrated and shot out the communicator. *Oh, great,* Chewie thought. *That's certainly not suspicious or anything*. From the look on Han's face, Chewie guessed that they'd have company in a minute or two. 

They rushed back to the detention block and opened up the cell, revealing a female human in white robes. They all jabbered together for a while while Chewie kept a lookout. And just as he suspected, it was only a matter of time before red lights flashed: the lock was being overridden. "Put on your damn helmet, you fool!" he shouted to Han. Both he *and* the kid had removed theirs, and at the *worst* possible time. What is *wrong* with these people?

Together, they backed into the tunnel and kept firing, searching for some escape. There would be no stemming this flood of storm troopers; there must have been *millions* on the Death Star, and it was only a matter of time before one was smart enough to bring up heavy weaponry. 

"Guys, there's an access panel to a maintenance tunnel over there," Chewie shouted over the din of the battle. He pointed further down the tunnel where he'd spotted the hatch. It wouldn't be hard to remove. But it was like Han didn't even hear him. He was too busy chattering with the other humans. "Damn it, Han! Listen!" 

The female human shot a hole through some type of grate, then dove in. "Han, why didn't you tell her about the damn access panel???" Chewie roared to his companion.

Han just shouted something back in basic and gestured toward the trash chute. It was too late for Chewie's suggestion now, anyway: the stupid human acted without waiting to hear if anyone else had any suggestions. Chewie didn't know a thing about her yet, but she seemed like the perfect match for stupid headstrong Han. "God damn it," Chewie growled to himself as he followed the princess down the trash chute. For the thousandth time, he swore that he was ready to give up on this life debt and return to Kashyyyk instead of constantly risking his life with this human numbskull again.

#### [WP] You have the ability to reverse time by 6 hours whenever you're about to die. You're currently on a 10 hour flight on a plane that's about to crash.

Score: 775

I had six hours, again. Whenever I was about to die I got a chance to turn everything back and correct the mistakes I had made. I got put six hours into the past, and I could re-try. 

Of course, sitting in seat 17C wasn't going to help me. At the point I was forced back to I'd already been sitting here for four hours. I was on this plane at the start of my six hours. 

I'd just finished learning that no third of the plane was safe, and that i couldn't get into the cockpit to do anything. None of that was going to solve my problems. I had to think of something else. 

I put my headphones in before the baby behind me started crying this time.

The last time I'd had to use my power was when my parents had picked me up from the airport and we were driving back. Someone had run a red light and destroyed the side of the car that I was on. Solving that problem had been easy, I'd just made sure that I asked for food on the way home. I'd just gotten back from University so my parents were willing to spoil me.

The time before that had been getting my friends to call a cab. I'd just offered to pay.

Before that I really shouldn't have tried to drive that fast.

I die in cars a lot.

Either way, at this point I was sitting in a plane and there wasn't an obvious solution. Six hours was a lot of time, but time wasn't the issue, it was the fact that I couldn't really leave the plane. Telling them that I was sick wasn't about to get an emergency landing, I'd asked, and they weren't stopping for any good reason.

If I got into the cockpit I could at least try to land the damn thing. Asking didn't work, so I figured I was going to need to force my way in. I grabbed the pen that I'd taken with me onto the plane, and stood up.

Someone grabbed me before I could make it anywhere close to the cockpit, an arm around my neck and forcing me down. People clapped, and I was restrained in the back. All that attempt got me was four hours without music before I died.

17C, turn on the music before the baby cries. Don't get restrained. The seat doesn't change anything. 

17C, turn on the music before the baby cries. Don't get restrained. You don't know enough about the inner workings of an airplane to change anything from the bathroom. The seat doesn't change anything.

17C, turn on the music before the baby cries. Don't get restrained. You don't know enough about the inner workings of an airplane to cause problems from the bathroom. The seat doesn't change anything. The hostess' name is Tamara, she's nice. Her Dad works pretty close to yours. No, she won't give you her number.

17C, turn on the music before the baby cries. Don't get restrained. You don't know enough about the inner workings of an airplane to cause problems from the bathroom. The seat doesn't change anything. None of the people around you have anything useful in their bags. The person in seat 38A is sympathetic, but just thinks you're crazy. The man in seat 23B won't take out his headphones. Tamara doesn't care about the plane crashing but didn't think it was a funny joke. The terrorist thing doesn't work even once the restraining man goes to the washroom, Tamara has one hell of a chokehold.  The hostess' name is Tamara, she's nice. Her Dad works pretty close to yours. No, she won't give you her number. If you're drunk enough, you're pretty sure you can feel the first second of dying. You need to get off this plane.

"Excuse me," I said to the woman of 14C. She took out her headphones. "Can I switch seats with you?" I asked.

She looked down at her leg room. She was in the exit row which meant that she had extra. She shook her head.

"Look I-" I stopped myself before I tried anything weird. "My legs really hurt and I need to stretch them out, I can do a hundred bucks to trade seats with you-"

"I'll do it," the man beside her said before she could speak.

"I want the window seat," I corrected as he started to get up. He looked at her. She looked at me. She shrugged. I pulled out my money.

We traded seats and I enjoyed the extra leg room. I wasn't here for the comfort, I was there for the fucking door. Some fresh air. Something before I kissed the Atlantic again. I needed to wait until the man beside me ended up going to the washroom. I needed the extra second. 

"One, two, three," I whispered to myself before reaching up and grabbing the handle. It didn't WANT to move, but I was desperate enough to force it. The plane hissed and an alarm started to go off. It swung open just a touch and I got my hand out into the free air. It burned. The woman two seats over screamed.

I kicked at the door, almost shattering my ankle to break the safety. You were SUPPOSED to be able to force it open in case of emergency, but most people weren't crazy enough to try. The door got slammed shut on my arm as I forced myself out of the plane. I didn't react, it was better than dying the same way.

Then the plane was above me and I was in white. A second later I could see the blanket of clouds. It was cold. I was floating in breathless freefall for as long as I could remember. I was stuck in the middle of the air, and it was all of the sound. I closed my eyes.

"Be safe sweetie," my mother said on the other end of the phone. I almost jumped out of my skin in the taxi to the airport. 

"Yeah Mom, I will," I said without thinking about it. 

I was six hours before I hit the ground. I could change when I went back. I was alive, and my power just became a lot more than a reset button.

EXT. A GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

*Several sinister-looking figures eagerly crowd around a mausoleum. Some of these individuals are clad in cloaks or robes, others have adorned themselves with red paint and bones, and a handful of them appear to be dressed in laboratory attire.*

**AUCTIONEER:** (*O.S.*) When graveyards are left unguarded, the valuable corpses within are up for auction! Coming up: Burial Bids!    
**CAEDES:** (*O.S.*) Get on with it!

*Looking slightly dejected, a man emerges from behind the mausoleum. This is the AUCTIONEER.*

**AUCTIONEER:** Come on, guys, this is never going to take off if you don't let me do my thing.

*A man in a hooded cloak shakes his staff in the air. This is CAEDES, a necromancer.*

**CAEDES:** Sod your thing! Some of us have armies to raise!    
**AUCTIONEER:** Alright, alright, there's no need to get impatient.    
**CAEDES:** It's three in the bloody morning!    
**AUCTIONEER:** Well, we couldn't very well do this during the day, could we?    
**ELEANORE:** (*O.S.*) Why not? Any necromancer worth their bones knows that it doesn't matter! Or is this all to do with your precious "ambience?"

*A murmur of agreement moves through the assembled group. One of them, a woman in a white coat, storms forward. This is ELEANORE.*

**ELEANORE:** (*CONT'D*) Also, what was all that about "valuable corpses?" The last time we did this, all we got were chickens!    
**AUCTIONEER:** That's the risk we all take! You know that!    
**ELEANORE:** *You* buried them there!

*The auctioneer feigns a look of shock.*

**AUCTIONEER:** I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about!    
**CAEDES:** Oh, shove it. We all know this little game of yours is rigged.

*Another murmur is heard from the crowd, this one louder.*

**AUCTIONEER:** It is not! These are real graves, with unknown contents!    
**ELEANORE:** Yeah, unknown to *us*, maybe.    
**AUCTIONEER:** I have no idea what you mean.    
**CAEDES:** Do we have to spell it out? She's saying that you buy them beforehand, check them out, and then sell them to us.    
**ELEANORE:** Only after he's taken the best corpses for himself, though!

*The crowd shouts in angry agreement. The auctioneer starts to look visibly nervous.*

**AUCTIONEER:** Uh, look... should we... should we start the bidding at...    
**CAEDES:** (*Interrupting*) You know what? Maybe we should just kill *you*, enthrall your corpse, and then divide *your* army up amongst ourselves!    
**ELEANORE:** (*Shouting*) Get him!

*All of the assembled necromancers rush forward, tackling the auctioneer. A scream is heard as a geyser of blood splashes against the mausoleum. Caedes remains near the corpse as everyone else backs away.*

**CAEDES:** Well, I'm glad that's done.

*He glances down at the body.*

**CAEDES:** (*CONT'D*) Oi! Who took his eye? Lephaid, was that you? Hand it over.

*A diminutive man in a parka begrudgingly hands a slightly squished eyeball to Caedes.*

**CAEDES:** (*CONT'D*) Right. Now, then... let's have a *proper* auction, shall we? Do I hear one hundred?

#### [WP] A boy in High School discovers he can create nations simply by vandalising his geography book

Score: 700

"And from here on, I pronounce the noble nation of Dickbutt." 

Mark gleefully clapped his hands. Dickbutt was bigger than the United States, and looked like...well, a dickbutt. 

"Mark!" Mark's head snapped to attention. His AP Human Geography teacher, Mrs. Purples, was glaring at him. "Is there something you wish to share with the class?"

"Err...no," Mark said. Somehow, he sensed that Mrs. Purples would not be very impressed with his latest creation.

Mrs. Purples sighed. "As I was saying, physiological population density is viewed as a superior measure of population density because..."

Mark giggled, continuing to vandalize his geography book. Dickbutt needed a neighbor. He knew just what to add...

"And now, for weather..."

"I'm sorry to interrupt you, Janice, but I have breaking news!" The TV blared. The screen split to show another reporter, eyes wide and tensely clutching a mic. "A new nation has been reported to have sprouted up between the US and Mexico! No one knows where it came from, but its citizens are calling themselves the..." Here, he paused, looking a little nervous, as afraid he was going to be black-screen censored. "The...Dickbuttians."  

Mark's jaw dropped. The Fruit Loop that almost reached his mouth instead clattered with the spoon to the kitchen floor. His dad, watching the television in the living room, grunted inquiringly. 

"And between Mexico and Guatemala, a small nation that calls itself Your Mom, has also emerged." The reporter attempted a smile. "Well, however these nations came about, professionals all seem to agree that their naming seems to have come down to a middle school boy." 

Mark started, affronted. "HIGH school," he said. 

He rummaged in his backpack for his geography book. Could it be...? He opened his book to its maps section. 

"Well, I never liked North Korea," Mark said, whipping out his black sharpie.

The man in white sighs. "Oh, she's nothing special. Compared to the others, I mean. Top marks in espionage and er...marksmanship."

"So she shoots people...'real good', too?" asks the Director, using his fingers as quotation marks.

"Her revolver is haunted by a psychotic little girl who murdered her birth parents and foster family. Doesn't run out of ammo, either. Kicks like a mule.

"Where did you even get that?"

"It was found crammed in someone's asshole at the LAX. Did you read the files? The debriefings?"

The man in white hands the Director an empty coffee mug. "To *gloat."*

"They're a freak show."

"Freak show? I'd rather like that name."

"How many bad guys, Marky-Mark?" Colt asks as he strutted stealthily down the bloody hallway, smoke pouring out of the barrels of 'Alice' and 'Eve'. 

"I COUNT SIX IN THE EASTERN CORRIDOR. THEY HAVE SEALED OFF EXITS 2 and 6. SWITCHING TO THERMAL-"

Colt fired another shot. "Make that five. And why's your volume so goddamn loud?"

"I DO NOT KNOW, AGENT TANNER."

Another voice comes on the comm. "It was me." Jessica sprints into the basement of the embassy and attaches explosives to the fuse boxes. 

"WHY WOULD YOU ADJUST MY AUDIO SETTINGS, AGENT KILROY?"

"It's for the time you blasted two million videos of *hardcore pornography* simultaneously on my desktop during the staff luncheon."

"YOU REQUESTED AN UPDATE ON MY LEARNING ABILITIES. I WAS MERELY SHOWING YOU MY RECENT DISCOVERIES UPON EXPLORING THE INTERNET AND HOW-"

"MARK...*fuck you."*

The gunslinger grazes another mercenary in the leg with his Winchester Repeater, pressing its nose into the man's forehead. "Who do you work for? Who sent you folks?"

"...Go...to...Hell..."

Sighing, Colt fires two shots into the man's belly, tearing through his vest and rupturing his internal organs. "You first, *boy."*

"Ugh...tell my wife...she was a *bitch*..." Life fades from the man's eyes. 

The gunslinger hugs the opposite wall, peeking through the window. Five heavily armed guards patrol the area, with the ambassador tied up in a chair next to a service desk. "I see our guy. Looks roughed up. Five of those mercs are wit'em. Anyone listenin'?"

In the basement, Jessica whips out her revolver and fires two shots, taking out two mercenaries by surprise. They are reduced to ashes. A voice screams into the dark crevices of her brain. 

**"EAT THEIR FLESH! GRIND THEIR BONES! SNIFF THE POWDER!"**

"Great, another voice in my head." mutters Jessica.

"HAIL SATAN.^HAIL^SATAN". snarls the possessed gun. 

Colt reloads his weapons. "Sir Remington, we need a distraction. Jess, you ready with the light thingies? This ain't how we do things at the ranch, but it'll do nicely."

Jessica nods. "On it." She flicks open the detonator as she runs up the stairs. "Armed and ready."

"READY TO ENGAGE." informs MARK. 

"Ready to rustle and tustle, sweetheart. Sir Remington, where are-"

*"TO GLORY! TO BAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTLE!"* yells a knight dressed in full battle armor atop a prancing horse, crashing through a hole in the wall courtesy of some C4. Sir Remington slices and dices, severing arms and separating limbs with relative ease. Bullets pound into his chestplate, but Sir Remington is not fazed. 

For he is son of King Phillip III. Protector of the Royal Court.

"Tis a flesh wound! Bow down in fear, for Sir Remington is here!"

The mercenaries dive to cover, but are quickly delivered to the gates of the afterlife via a gauss sniper rifle perched 6000 meters away on a rooftop. "KILL CONFIRMED." responds MARK. 

"Copy that." Jessica presses the detonator, shutting off the power by overloading the generators. Colt puts on his night vision goggles, downs a bottle of whiskey, then goes in guns blazing, the room illuminated with brief flashes of fire and gunpowder igniting. 

One in the chamber.

One in the skull of a scumbag who thought he could escape Colt's aim. 

Sir Remington tramples a man to death, delivering the final blow with his mace. Jessica joins the fight, finishing off stragglers who may have survived the initial ambush. The shining knight gets off his mighty steed and unties the ambassador. 

"Who...who are you people?" asks the old man, scared out of his mind. "Oh dear..."

"I AM SIR REMINGTON! SON OF KING PHILIP III! PROTECTOR OF THE ROYAL-"

"Here we go again, with this fucking introduction..." complains Jessica. 

"Man's got heart, miss." says Colt, lighting a cigar. 

Back at base, the man in white stirs his coffee. "Team, report."

"Uh...everyone's dead." responds Jessica.

"How's the weather over there?"

"Rainy."

"That's England for ya."

"HAIL SATAN." screams the gun. 

"Oh, is that Jess's little helper? Tell her to be good."

Jessica rolls her eyes.

"I WILL EAT YOUR CAT." responds the psychotic spirit. 

"Okay, settle down now. See you on Tuesday. And you know what that means. Tacos are back on the menu."

#### [WP] A group of teens find a map that will lead them to friendship, only to find out that the real treasure is hidden pirate gold.

Score: 578

"You can't be serious Jake?"  Nathan looked at him incredulously.  "This is way too dangerous.  Where did you even find this map?"

Nathan looked down at the map in front of him.  "I told you Nathan, I found it online.  All it wants us to do is lower someone down the well to get to the chest at the bottom.  it's probably some kind of geocache thing."

"The rope looks fine," said Pete as he looked down the well and examined the winch.  It hadn't even crossed his mind that they wouldn't do it.

Jake, Nathan, and Pete had been friends back in the day at summer camp in Middle School.  Then High School had rolled around and with it, the notion that the escapades of their recent youth had been childish fantasies, and they'd fallen out of touch.  Fate had landed them at college within and hour of each other though and Jake had reached out to his two lost friends on Facebook.  

Everyone was excited about seeing each other again, but then Jake realized he was at a loss for what to do.  Putting years of education and practice at social interaction to use, Jake decided the obvious logical solution was to ask Google.  The top result for "Best way to reconnect with friends" had landed them on an adventure through the woods.  So far, it was working.  They all found themselves reconnecting with their old buddies as they scaled small rock faces and forded creeks as they would have at camp six years ago.

The directions had said not to read to the future steps until you accomplished the previous ones, but looking at the well, Jake wasn't so sure anymore.  They were pretty far out and no one know they were here.  Who knew where it would lead next.

Pete was already hoisting himself onto the edge of the old well though and fastening the rope around his waist, reinforcing it with straps from his pack.  

"Pete, this isn't a good idea."  Nathan's voice quavered with indecision.  He knew that what they were doing was always the preface to a story about a horrible accident, but he didn't want to be the wet blanket of the group either.  

"Don't worry Nathan, it'll be fine," said Pete.  "You two just grab that end and lower me and I'll call up when I get whatever's down there and you can pull me up on the winch."

Pete made it sound so simple.  Once everyone was at their stations, he pulled his feet from the edge of the well and let himself hang over the gaping hole.  "Alright, go for it," and down he went.

Jake guessed that they'd lowered him thirty feet or so before he called up for them to stop.  They fastened the rope on the winch and peered down into the well.  They could see his flashlight moving around but couldn't make anything out.  After a couple minutes, they heard him call back up and starting cranking the winch.

Pete resurfaced wearing a pirate hat and holding a cutlass.  Under his arm was a small chest.  "Guys check this out!  How cool is this?"

Jake took the sword from him as he pulled himself over the lip of the well.  To his surprise, it was real, and it looked old.  He swung it around a couple times.

"Jesus Jake, watch where you're swinging that!"  Nathan jumped back even though the sword was a good three feet from him.

"Calm down Nathan," came Pete's voice as he leaned over the tiny chest.  Nathan muttered a reply under his breath, but they all leaned in together as he opened the chest.  To their disappointment, all it held was a small, silver key.

"Some treasure," snorted Nathan.

"There's still a couple steps left," said Jake.  "It'll probably lead to something cool."

So, unfolding the next step and ignoring Nathan's complaints, they wandered deeper into the woods.
_____

Half an hour later found them at a large rock face.  Jake could hear the sound of waves crashing on the beach on the far side of the rock formation.  He'd been born inland, and it always amazed him how loud the ocean was.  

He and his friends for feeling up and down the rock looking for a tiny hole that was said to fit the key they'd found at the well but they'd been looking for fifteen minutes and hadn't had any luck so far.

"Wait...I got something," came Nathan's voice.  Even he'd gotten caught up in the idea of treasure and it had renewed his sense of adventure.

Pete and Jake ran over and Pete inserted the key into the hole.  It turned easily and to their amazement, a false stone wall slide away from the surface of the rock revealing a hollowed out tunnel.

"Dude.  Jake, this is the greatest treasure hunt ever," said Pete, his mouth hanging open.  To his left, Nathan didn't look so sure.

The list had recommended that they bring flashlights and they pulled them out.  Pete took the lead down the narrow passage followed by Jake with Nathan taking up the rear.  "It's just like the Goonies," came an awed whisper from Pete in the front.

As if on cue, a rumbling sounded in the Earth and Jake grabbed Pete's pack and pulled him backwards.  A boulder slid across the path in front of them through a concealed tunnel.  As they stared in stunned shock, it continued rolling back and forth before losing momentum and settling just off the path.

"Alright guys, that's it," came Nathan's voice.  "This is crazy.  Someone's going to get hurt.  I don't know what you found Jake, but we're not supposed to be here.  This is nuts!"

"Nathan, are you serious?" came Pete's voice.  "This is everything we always talked about when we were little.  We can't stop now.  We have to finish this."

Nathan stared at him in disbelief.  "Are you kidding?  Someone could die.  This isn't just a game anymore!  If you want to go on, go for it, but I'm going back.  Jake, you coming?"

Jake wanted to go back with Nathan.  That was the smarter thing to do, but Pete was right.  This was the adventure he'd always dreamed about, and now that they knew what they were up against, they'd be fine.  The boulder was hardly big enough to kill anyone.  Just would have done a bit of damage is all.

"I'm going with Pete."  The words stumbled out of his mouth and Nathan looked at him like he was crazy.

After a moment, Nathan's senses came back to him.  "Fine.  Be that way, but I'm leaving.  You can guys finish this stupid mission on your own."

"At least leave your light," said Pete as Nathan turned.  He threw it on the ground and walked away into the darkness.  "Well, mate.  Looks like it's just me and you," he said to Jake.  For some reason, that sent shivers down Jake's spine.

They continued through the passages avoiding a couple more traps, but still nothing lethal.  Jake was glad they'd seen them though.  It wouldn't have been fun to crawl out of here with a broken ankle.  

Finally, a light appeared in front of them at the end of the tunnel.  Jake released a sigh of relief and started walking towards it, but Pete reached out and grab his shoulder.  "Wait," he said quietly.  He used the end of Nathan's light to push a pressure plate on the floor and an arrow released from a trap and shot across the tunnel in front of them.

The color drained from Jake's face.  "Pete, maybe Nathan was right.  That could have killed someone.  Maybe this is crazy.  We should go."

"Jacob, Jacob" came Pete's voice menacingly in the dark.  "There's only one step left once we're out of here.  We're so close!  You can't leave me now."

Jake didn't like the way Pete was talking, but Pete was right.  They were so close.  Against his better judgment, he pushed onward.  

There were no more traps in the tunnel and the pair emerged victorious on the beach revealing the ocean that Jake had heard earlier.  Although it was beautiful, there was nothing here but some trees and it was far too cold to go swimming.

"Open the last clue Jake," said Pete.  Jake pulled it from his pocket and unfolded it.  

*If ye be wantin' me treasure, ye have to dig where the two trees cross.  Good work matey.*

Jake looked up from the note and found Pete pointing to a place up the beach where the branches of two trees crossed clearly forming an "X".

The pair tore down the beach and up to the tree.  They hadn't brought shovels, but that didn't stop them from digging into the sand with their hands.  The spot was far enough up that they didn't have to worry about the tide.  It didn't seem like it reached this far.  Finally, the corner of a chest emerged.  After a few more minutes of frantic digging, the full chest was revealed.

Pete patted Jake on the shoulder.  "Do you want to do the honors?"  Jake leaned forward and grabbed the latch of the chest, thoughts of wealth and fame tearing through his mind.  He unleashed the latch and pulled it open.  The glow of gold was interrupted by a flash of brown as a makeshift spear shot up and stabbed him through the chest.

Pete took him and laid him gently down on the beach, his breathing frantic.  But instead of helping, Pete turned back to the gold.

"Pete," Jake croaked out.  "D-did you know?"  It was becoming difficult to speak.

"I didn't know, but I suspected," came Pete's voice as he lifted a coin from the chest and examined it.  "But don't worry matey."  His voice seemed to shift.  "Ye won't be forgotten.  All's left to do is hunt down that traitorous vagrant Nathan and then it's off to the high seas."

The last thing Jake saw was Pete fixing the pirate hat on his head and pulling the cutlass from his belt.

#### [WP] A world in which Good and Evil are career fields, and heros and villains battle daily...from 9am-5pm. Except now two friends- a hero and a villain- have begun to suspect there's more going on behind the scenes.

Score: 562

The Blue Bolt slammed his third shot in so many minutes and shook his head, causing the turquoise mask to go slightly akilter. He made his way back to the table, already wobbling just a bit. One downside to having super speed is that you also have a super metabolism that processes alcohol into the bloodstream almost instantaneously. Across from him, Professor Geroth looked up from his newspaper. "You're going to destroy your liver like that, you know."

Bolt just snorted and waved a finger at the waitress to bring another round. "So? This is like... my third one already. Don't you all have access to lab-grown organs on the villain health plan?"

Geroth shrugged. "We do, but that doesn't mean I want to *use it* all the time. You know, I used to tell my minions not to hit you too hard. For professional courtesy and whatever. But if you're just abusing your body like this, I'm going to tell them to give it everything they've got."

"HA!" he laughed and eyed the waitress approaching with his booze like a dog staring at a treat in its master's hand. "When have your minions ever landed a *finger* on me? You know I'm too fast for them."

"Yeah, whatever." Geroth went back to reading his newspaper. "Hey, did you see this story?" He turned the front of the paper towards Bolt, who gulped down his fourth shot before the waitress had even put the glass on the table. 

A goofy, lopsided grin that Geroth saw most nights at the bar was spreading across the Bolt's face. He was officially drunk. "*See it?* I was there!" He pointed to the large photo taking up most of the front page, showing Gorillord being thrown through the side of a tanker ship down at the docks. Bolt wasn't clearly in the photo, but there was a blue blur right there in the middle that most people in the city recognized anyway. The large headline atop the page proclaimed: **BLUE BOLT DOES IT AGAIN!** "I thought you had super intelligence, man."

"Not that, you dolt." Geroth raised the level of the paper just a bit to point out one tiny article that had just barely made the bottom corner of the front page; most of it had been relegated to the depths of page A12. "A journalist who was investigating the First Republic Bank of Frian for money laundering was killed under mysterious circumstances. Killed in a car accident on the opposite side of the city... found in the driver's seat, and yet he didn't even own a car or have a license."

Bolt wasn't even listening anymore; he was locking eyes with a blonde who had just strolled past, and a nuclear explosion across the table probably wouldn't be able to break his concentration now. One upside to working for the Hero side is all of the public adoration; there was a reason that Bolt was still in his costume *hours* after his shift ended, while Geroth was wearing blue jeans and a tweed jacket over an unassuming sweater. "Yeah, so?" Bolt managed to answer, still drooling over the girl.

"Look, one thing about super intelligence is that you notice patterns, OK?" Geroth turned back to the paper and read over the article for the tenth time. "And I've noticed that every time *I* get a new assignment to hatch some evil scheme, it just *happens* to coincide with FRBF getting into some sort of trouble or doing something suspicious." When he looked back up, his friend was no longer sitting at the table across from him, but instead had flashed across the bar and had his spandex-clad arm around the blonde's shoulder. Geroth rolled his eyes and turned to the back page of the article, looking for anything useful.

"You're making a big deal out of nothing," Bolt said from across the table again. He had a habit of doing that: just zipping from one place to another like a hummingbird with ADHD. "We're on the front page like every day." He beamed a bit as he remembered all of his past exploits that were framed and hanging on the wall of his den. "So *of course* it's going to line up with every time that this bank gets into trouble."

"Don't you even care?" Geroth spat out. "The only thing you give a shit about is that girl's number!" He said it sarcastically, but Bolt grinned and raised his palm (covered in black sharpie) to show that he'd already gotten it. Geroth just rolled his eyes. "I thought you were supposed to be the *hero* here."

Bolt shrugged, already eyeing a different target in a short skirt. "I'm off the clock, buddy. I'll be a hero again around 9:30 AM tomorrow. As soon as I leave..." he squinted at the black sharpie on his hand "*Bethany's* apartment."

"Forget it," Geroth grumbled. He stood from the bar stool and stormed out of the bar, letting the wooden door slam shut behind him.

Halfway down the block, a gust of wind blew past. "All right, man," Bolt said from right beside him, slurring his words a little. "Let's do a little freelance work, eh? Will that make you feel better?"

Geroth grimaced, waiting for him to make some kind of joke. But Bolt actually seemed sincere. "We'll need more information..." Geroth said, more muttering to himself than actually talking to his hero companion. "I'll need to check previous newspapers to see how far back the correlation goes..."

Before he'd even finished his sentence, Bolt zipped off in a flash of blue and returned a moment later with a stack of newspapers, including *tomorrow's* paper. "The Herald's office was unlocked!" he said cheerfully before letting out a loud burp. "What's next, chief?"

#### [WP] You're a police officer in the late 19th century hunting down an escaped mental patient named Sherlock Holmes who is an alcoholic, drug addict, and self proclaimed detective.

Score: 515

The sounds of his foot steps on the cobble road echoed off the tight alley walls. When he was lost in thought he often took walks. Sometimes these walks took him much further from home than anticipated, and on a few occasions into areas of town he dared only to tread due to his position. For the last two months he'd been following this case. 

A man by the name 'Sherlock Holmes' had escaped custody of a sanatorium, and has sense gone on to elude police capture. At first they didn't think much of it. Just some poor loon who'd gone and broken out. His file said he had a thing for the bottle and was reported as having frequented opium dens. Then they heard how he escaped. It would seem that despite his diagnosis Holmes was quite the adversary. He managed to incapacitate a guard, secure a uniform, and altered his appearance just enough to evade suspicion. When questioned the guard at the gate said he saw a slight looking male nurse leave about an hour before Holmes was reported missing. The bastard managed to walk right out the door.

From there things only became more odd. Holmes, it would seem, has an affinity for solving crimes. In the two months since he escaped he has left hints, notes, and on one occasion risked his own capture to lead officers to criminals. Were he a copper he would have had an impressive number of collars. The citizens began to idolize him and meanwhile the police force caught hell from the chief of police all the way to members of Parliament. 

The officer paused and leaned against a wall. From his pocket he produced a cigarette and brought it to his lips. He reached for his lighter only to find it wasn't in his pocket. He began to feel about at his coat and trousers when the sound of a match strike alerted him to someone else's presence in the alley.

"Need a light," a thick cockney accent asked. 

He looked to his left. Just a ways away from him stood a man with shaggy hair holding a lit match. The flame illuminated just enough to show the patches of dirt on his face. Even from a distance the officer could smell the booze on him. 

"You shouldn't sneak up on a police officer, sir. Bad for my health and quite possibly yours. But it would seem I am in need of a light so your presence is welcome."

The boozy man chuckled sightly and snuffed out the match. He lit another and made his way over slowly. Once close by his gingerly brought the flame to the end of the cigarette and lit it. The officer took a drag and exhaled a cloud of smoke into the cool night air. 

"Mind if I join ya," the boozy man pulled a weathered pipe from his tattered rags.

"By all means. It would seem I'm in your alley anyway."

The boozy man hummed and chuckled wryly. He struck another match and lit his pipe with a couple of puffs. 

"So what brings you to my side of town, eh?"

"Just out for a stroll actually," the officer said exhaling more smoke, "helps me think."

"A good walk can clear the mind I suppose," his manner of speaking had changed slightly. 

The officer hummed in agreement. As his cigarette burned to ash he produced another and motioned for another light. This time the boozy man brought out a small, gold lighter and flicked it to make a flame. He brought it to the tip of the cigarette when the officer noticed something. That was his lighter. The cigarette fell from his lips and he looked at the boozy man.

"Where did you," he stammered, "how did you get this lighter?"

"That's a waste of a cigarette you know," the mans diction was clear now. His accent more refined and precise. 

"That is *my* lighter," the officer said snatching it out of the mans hand. 

"I procured it earlier when you were walking, John. You really should be more aware. If I can pick your pocket I'm not sure how you survive the hordes of street children."

John grabbed the boozy man by his collar and slammed him to the wall. 

"Now, now officer Watson," the man said, "let's not be so rash."

John slammed the mans back against the wall.

"Who the hell are you and how do you know me? You picked my pocket? When I never-," he paused. He eyes grew wide. 

"I most certainly did take your lighter but I was not wearing these rags. And I smelled significantly less like a tavern floor. Which is where I found this shoddy coat actually. A little soot from the fire place on my face, a change in speech pattern, and since I've grown my hair out there's no way you'd know me immediately."

"Holmes," John said gravely, "I finally got you this time."

"Yes, you were quite close the last time. Thankfully I was able to elude you and bring you right to that drug shipment. I was also able to take a little for myself, so really we all won."

"Well now I've got you in my hands and I'm bringing you in."

"You're not the least bit curious as to why I just turned myself in to you? I evade capture for 67 days and I just willingly give myself to the man who was closest to catching me?"

Johns brow furrowed. He had a point. There's no reason for this. Maybe he was done running? No that was too simple. Holmes wouldn't just quit. 

"I'll give you 30 seconds."

"I don't need that many to tell you there is to be an attempt on the lives of the police chief and his family sometime in the next hour."

Johns blood ran cold. Was he setting John up? Was this an attempt at escaping? But then again Holmes had "helped" capture almost 20 criminals now, and all of his hints and clues were correct in leading to their capture. 

"How do you know that?"

"I have eyes in the city. Information dead drops most everywhere. I know people who know people and gather intelligence as I require. This seemed important enough to warrant direct confrontation with one of London's finest officers. Not a great detective, mind you, but certainly a good officer."

John gritted his teeth. The information was processing in his mind. There was no reason he couldn't just take Holmes in and interrogate him for information. But he may not talk at all and if the chiefs life was truly in danger he wouldn't acknowledge it without evidence. Hell even with evidence he may not pay it any mind. But if his family was also in danger then it made matters even more pressing. Then there was the time constraint. 

"Well?"

John looked at Holmes. *Fuck* he said internally. 

"I let you help me on this and I guarantee your safety and escape. That's what you want, right?"

"Yes and no," Holmes spoke calmly, "yes you will let me help you, but I won't be 'escaping' so much as continuing to help you."

"I beg your pardon?"

"I propose a partnership. I like solving these cases and the thrill it brings but I can't do it in the open. I can act upon those criminals but I'd surely be deemed a vigilante or killed. Rather I will help you become a detective, you will bring them to me, I help you and you get a criminal off the street."

"So you're just a good person, huh? Why not become a cop if you wanted to catch criminals so badly?"

"Please if you want to solve crimes and get results you don't become a cop. The restrictions hold you back, and your outward appearance kills off leads and sources who don't speak to police. I like the thrill of the chase. The harder the better. Nothing more than that?"

"So the police chiefs life and the lives of his family have no barring on the decision then?"

"This is a *gift* Watson. I only brought this to you as an exchange. People die everyday and many of them do so very boringly. The fact this saves lives is of little importance to me but to you," he trailed off.

John tensed up and his arms shook. He exhaled sharply as he released his grip and shoved Holmes away. Holmes extended his hand.

"Partners?"

John eyed him warily. He stuck his hand out begrudgingly and squeezed Holmes hand as they shook. 

"Just tell me what is going to happen or who is involved and we'll go from there."

"Very well. This way Watson," Holmes turned sharply and began to walk briskly out of the alley. 

John stared at him and then began to follow behind. 

"It's 'Officer Watson'."

"Please, John, we're partners now. We can drop formalities."

#### [WP] A group of aliens is baffled by the fact we still have organized religions at this stage of development. To get answers, they abduct two spiritual leaders for questioning. To be more specific, they grab Pope Francis and the leader of ISIS...

Score: 514

"Sweet Sister Mary, what on Earth is going on here? What is that sinful *abomination* doing at the table with us?" Pope Francis asked wildly, his hat bobbing. There were three other people sitting with him, and two weren't even *people*.

"Surely, human, you can be a more civilized guest in this hall," an enormous, purple, furry being stated firmly. It looked like Yogi bear, if Yogi had been raised a meth addict.

"Oh, not you, sir. *Him*." Francis was pointing at Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, who spat on the table in response.

"I'd say he brought us here for a discussion amongst the enlightened, but you are here," Abu Bakr responded in perfect Spanish. The Pope raised his eyebrows, turning to the aliens.

"Yes, we noticed your species still cannot communicate amongst itself properly- I don't know how you can voyage into space but not speak with one another, though that is another issue entirely. We have set up a universal communication rig, so you can communicate freely," one of the aliens responded.

"What is it you would like from us?" Francis asked surprisingly calmly.

"Answers. We have been watching your species for some time now, and we would like to know a few things. First of all, why does your species have religion at this stage in development?"

Abu Bakr snickered. "Allah is the reason we exist. We aim to please him, by purging the world of those who would be unfit in his eyes."

Francis groaned, rubbing at his temples. "Look, your species seems very intelligent. I would love to discuss these issues with you, but this guy here, he's... well, you know. Insane? Religion is a vessel by which we explore ourselves, our souls, and connect with God. This man uses it as a vice to harm others."

"You did not answer my question. Why do you still believe in it? The books were written when your species still believed that Earth was the center of the universe. It has sections that don't make any sense at all, clearly written by men. Why do you still believe it?"

"It was written by men, yes," Francis answered, "but the message is God's alone. We are here to live proper lives and do what we can to help others. We are God's servants, and each day is a test of our faith. Time will not change that, not in any way."

"And you? What do you say?" The alien asked the ISIS leader.

"I say this man and his ideals are trash. Nothing but lies meant to lead people down the wrong path, away from Allah."

"You did not answer my question. Why do you still believe it?"

"Because it is the written word."

"Okay...that- that's the only reason why?"

"Yes, it is the written word and we will purge everyone who disagrees."

"If I may, this man is the worst representative you could have chosen," Francis interjected. "I have read the Qu'ran, three times now, and it is a book of love and unity. Too often to men mistake their personal angers for God's will, as if they are prophets themselves."

Abu Bakr tried to respond, but the alien disallowed it. "I see. Your species is...odd. It has appeared to evolve in stages."

"Stages?"

"Yes, stages. Those who have realized that their gods were made up to control and comfort the masses through human emotion, those who still believe it but attempt to better society with it, and those who still view it as a weapon. Staggered evolution, how incredibly odd. And to think, you can't even speak the same language. No wonder your species is in such constant turmoil. How you even made it this far is beyond me..."

"You insult Allah, you are an enemy combatant to me," Abu Bakr shouted, standing up. The quiet alien vaporized him with some kind of laser.

"Grngk, I told you no weapons! Look at what you've done now! The humans will hate us, we are supposed to be a diplomatic people!"

Francis leaned back, raising his eyebrows. "Now, normally, I object to that sort of thing, but...I think that in this case, we can make an exception."

#### [WP] Humans are known in the galaxy for being a bit dim, but also for being the very best mechanics around, and inexplicably able to fix machines beyond their comprehension. You have broken down on Earth, and having the apes work on your craft is both fascinating and terrifying.

Score: 502

Xel’thor had heard the stories about these earth men, apes really, being the paragon of mechanical ingenuity, but surely those had been exaggerations.   Passing through that asteroid field was a bad idea, Xel’thor thought.  The power failure to the deflector shields couldn’t have come at a worse time; the impacts from those asteroids must have knocked the crystal containment system out of equilibrium.  At least the two humans seemed willing enough to help, towing the cruiser to some kind of red wooden building.  

“Now don’t you worry Mr. Eltho, Clem here’ll get ya all patched in no time.”

“It’s Xel’thor”

“Pardon?”

“It’s Xel’thor, Norman.  See I took the time to listen and remember your name.”

“Now, there’s no need to be rude mister,” Norman replied.  Xel’thor stared at Clem and Norman.  Norman and Clem had been in the field when Xel’thor’s ship came crashing down, working on a large green tractor.  Great, Xel’thor thought to himself.  I need to make contact with my handler halfway across the sector two hours from now.  And now the fate of the Osgrellian Empire rests on a man wearing grease stained overalls without a shirt and an old man in a cowboy hat.  

“Clem, if it’s quite alright with you, I’d like to oversee the repairs.  You see, this ship and the contents of its data safe are actually quite important.  The-”

“Yeah that’s fine Mr. Elmore.  You can hand me shit from my toolbox.” Clem interrupted.

“...Great….Also, it’s Xel-thor.”

Clem plugged in a work light and slid underneath the cruiser.    Norman walked over to an old radio and turned it on.  The sound of country music filled the old barn.  “I’m gonna go grab some coffee fellas.  Clem, I’ll bring you back your usual.  Mr. Velcro, would you like some coffee while ya wait?”

“No”

“Alrighty then, I’ll leave you two to it.”

Xel-thor dozed off for nearly an hour when the sound of pounding metal brought him back to alertness.  It appeared to Xel-thor that Clem had merely started beating the side of the cruiser with some kind of large hammer.  
“What the *hell* are you doing to my ship?”

“See, you got quite a few dents here mister.  I’m pounding them out.”

“This may be a little too complex for you earthling, by this ship is powered by a Osgrellian crystal reactor.  They’re exceedingly-”

“Delicate” Clem said.

“...uhh yes.  Delicate.  Very delicate.”

“See I figured that.  That’s why I put it over there on yonder table.  Now, I may be just a humble mechanic, but seems like these dents are poking into that crystal’s containment doo-hickey.  So you aint going anywhere til we get these dents fixed.”

Xel-thor stood there speechless as Norman returned with two paper cups of coffee.  “Alright, I got one black for me and one double skinny orange happy-cino for you Clem.” Norman said.  “So was it like ya figured Clem? Dents causing trouble with the power core’s containment system?”

“Yeah, more or less.  This one had a crystal instead of the usual anti-matter though.” Clem replied, taking his coffee.  “Bigger problem is with the shields.  I gave the generator the old once over, but I don’t think there’s anything technically wrong with it.  Looks like it might not be compatible with the ship since it’s an aftermarket model.”  Both Clem and Norman stared at Xel-thor, sipping coffee.

“I was assured it was the right model….”

“Uh-huh.  Betcha that salesman was more than happy to look that up for you too, huh.” Clem said.

“Now, Clem don’t be hard on the fella.  Some folks is just a little slower than others.”

“I am *not* slow. I’m *very* important and am *very* smart.”

“Sure ya are Mr. Xel-thor.  So the way I figure it, I’ll set ya up with this older spare shield generator I got, rated for a ship of your class, and I’ll hold onto this one.  With parts and labor, I reckon that should square us up.” Clem said. 

Fifteen minutes later, Xel-thor’s ship took off and was in orbit in a matter of seconds.  Clem and Norm stood in the field looking toward the sky.  “You know that fancy shield generator was rated for his ship just fine, right Clem?”

“Well of course I know that Norman.  We gotta make money somehow though, Norm."

#### [WP] Everyone is born with a disability and an ability. A test is done at birth to determine these, if they aren't already apparent. You, well, you were born with crippled legs and have the power of super speed.

Score: 484

"A cripple with superspeed!" Benny Madsen laughed, and looked around like he expected everyone to laugh along with him. Benny had superstrength, and looked it. He was a roided-out fucker at least a head taller than almost everyone else in school, and that included more than a few teachers. He was also profoundly tone-deaf, which if you ask me shouldn't count as a disability, but when have I ever been in charge of anything? And I admit, it was pretty funny watching his face go red when he tried to croak out the national anthem like a good patriotic American. 

I refrained from rolling my eyes and shifted uncomfortably on my crutches. My leg brace clacked against the ground, calling attention to itself. I'd managed to stay out of Benny's way so far, but I suppose I couldn't have kept it up forever. "Good one," I said. "I haven't heard that a hundred times already." 

Benny strutted up to me, lowering his head below his shoulders and making like the Hulk. "Must be pretty sad," he sneered, "being one of God's mistakes."

"We can't all be perfect," I said, and hummed the first few bars of the Star-Spangled Banner.

Benny scowled, and flicked a single finger. My right crutch was wrenched out of my grip, clattering twenty feet away. The force of the blow sent me toppling to the ground. I managed to catch myself on my hands, but the impact rattled through my legs anyway. "Fuck!" I lay there on the grass, wincing, as Benny loomed over me. 

"Not nice to make fun of people's disabilities," he said.

"Yeah," I said, and was gone. 

His eyes were barely tracking me as I crawled the twenty feet to my crutch, dragging the other behind me. Then I was on my feet, hobbling, and Benny was lost. I slipped behind him, unbuckled his belt, and pulled his pants down to his ankles. Then, while he was turning around, I did the old trick of tying his shoelaces together. That one was kind of a close call, but I managed it. 

I made my way back in front of him. My legs were throbbing and I was going to have a hell of a time explaining this to my parents, but it was worth it. Benny spun, his pants slipped down, and he collapsed right on his ass showing his tighty-whiteys. I made my painful way over to him, and he looked up at me, almost innocent, with this utterly baffled look on his face. 

"I can still hobble faster than you can run, motherfucker."

#### [WP] Reddit karma works exactly like mana in real life, the more you have of it allows increasingly greater spells and abilities you can wield. But nobody considered what the greatest negative karma holders might be able to do...

Score: 482

We called him Unidan. For aeons he was a force of good - a hugely powerful sorcerer and the wisest of all living beings. His knowledge was astonishing.  

Many called him an oracle and some worshipped him as a living God. They were right to do so for his power rivalled that of any God. Everyday he was worshipped with a million up-votes. Every day his power increased.

His reign was called *the Benevolence*. Just and kind and wise. If ever a darkness arose or trolls escaped from the lower echelons of the Earth, Unidan destroyed them in a raging storm of fire and flame. We thought he was protecting *us*. Later we found out the truth.

After a great period of time Unidan began to turn his malice on the innocent. He developed a mad thirst for power, a lust for control that compelled him to destroy any potential rivals. Good men died but he would reassure us it was for a 'greater good'. He was a master of manipulation.

We began to understand what he was doing. We tried to stop him, to weaken his power with downvotes. Humanity came together to destroy the evil we had created, but we made a grave mistake. No one knew the consequences of such negative karma. My god, if only we had known.

His reign of prosperity ended and so began the age of Malevolence. 

Unidan changed physically. He no longer cared about his facade. His eyes gradually blackened and it was said the darkness of hell could be seen within them. Giant scaled wings sprouted from his shoulder blades. Huge horns rose from his skull. Madness consumed him. 

He began the systematic genocide of the popular, for no mortal could be allowed to reach a level of power that could challenge him. Everyday, a random person with over 10,000 karma would be executed. It took years but he culled them all. He then began on the over 5000, then then 1000. People were afraid to give anyone karma as it might mean a death sentence.

The negative karma accounts worshipped him and became his followers.

Life was bleak and it was impossible to see a future outside of Unidan's grasp. 

But then, a hero arose.

This is his story.

**New message from ChaosBill**    

Hi RatsAss24. It is good to see a new user - it has been a long, long time. I saw your post and anon is right, you must be careful talking about this kind of stuff. The one he refers to is called 'Unidan'. He is not a very nice person, and he is incredibly powerful. He can erase *your very existence*. 

**Reply to ChaosBill**    

Hi! Thanks for the message. Erase me? You mean my account right?    

**New message from ChaosBill**    

I mean he will literally kill you. You're new around here so let me explain. The more upvotes you get, the higher your karma levels. The higher your karma, the more powerful you become. The same is true of negative karma. Unidan has more negative karma than was thought possible.

**Reply to ChaosBill**

Wow. That's pretty scary. What can we do?

**New message from ChaosBill**

Hm. In the past we tried to fight him. The strong, like gallowboob, fought him in battle, but that was a mistake. Negative Karma is much stronger than Positive Karma.  Unidan was too powerful and defeated, then executed gallowboob. Then vargas. Then awildsketchappeared. Then all of the hyper positives.

Now there is only Unidan who controls such power. 

I shouldn't really be telling you this but there are a small group of us who are trying to bring him down...*from the inside*. We have a private subreddit - it has a invisibility charm that stops him from seeing into it. I will send you an invite. 

---------

Hi guys. ChaosBill invited me to the sub. Look, I have heard about Unidan. I want to help bring him down, and I have got a plan. He is not going to let anyone get *more* karma than him, that much is clear. 

But he won't mind me getting building up some negative karma if he thinks I am one of his believers...   then I post something so awful, so terrible, that my negative karma overtakes his! What do you guys think?

#### Write a story that seems normal on first sight, except for one small detail that makes it extremely creepy on a more careful reading [WP]

Score: 477

To my dearest friends, 

Hey, everyone back at St. John's, I know I was supposed to wait before sending a letter but I just have so much to say! Everyone in my new home is so lovely and wonderful, my dad tucks me in every night and my mom is teaching me how to sculpt! Clay is an amazing medium, with so much potential. Lovely birds, foxes and owls to daisies and petunias- I can make it all, now! Anything at all, I can create with the help of my mom. You wouldn't believe how kind she is, always providing me with fresh materials to practice on. 

I'm learning so much here, every single day! Seriously, I hope you all find wonderful homes of your own one day. Freedom is a magical thing, one to greatly envy! Love is beautiful, especially parental love, and I'm still trying to get used to it. Every day I grow a little stronger, knowing they're supporting me so much. Sleeping in a real bed every night is incredible, too! Here, they even have these great curtains that keep the light out- you know how much I love the dark.

Surely, you will all know the wonder that is family soon enough. Each and every one of you will know what it's like to really have a mom and dad. Nobody deserves to live like an orphan, not even if you think otherwise. Dreams can come true!

Here I've just gone and rambled too much, sorry about that. Everyone here tells me I talk too much, as well. Love you all! Please respond to this letter!

I stood there for a while. Version 2.0? What the hell was that? I glanced at the keyboard sitting patiently next to the mug of cold Earl Grey and slowly sat down on the chair. Carefully and deliberately, I wrote down "MOREINFO" and hit Enter.

A wall of text appeared:

#### [WP] A "popular" girl falls in love with a "nerdy" boy, however he hates her and she spends all her time trying to impress him

Score: 456

I leaned my shoulder against the doorway and stared. The room looked enormous without all of my Marvel posters lining the walls and all of my books stacked on their shelves. All that remained was my twin bed & small desk.

The door rang cutting short my farewell to my stripped childhood abode. It was Ava dropping off my Calvin & Hobbes comics. There was no way I was going to head to Berkley & let her keep them. 

She was fidgeting & wouldn't stop talking. She never stops talking. A few months ago she wouldn't even look me in the eyes if we passed each other in the hallways. But she hasn't left me alone since I started tutoring her in physics though. Tough shit. I didn't  care how much she batted her eyelashes at me. I never gave her a free class. Not a single one.

She was rambling more than usual. Something about Kelly Sherman's boyfriend or her dog. I'd clearly missed a vital part of the story because the next thing I know she suddenly blurts out, "I'm in love with you."

"Huh?"

"I'm in love with you... I know it sounds crazy... But if you could just hear me out--"

"Hear you out??? Ava. You've scorned me since eight grade. We've been neighbors since preschool. We were best friends until my dad was caught cheating with Principal Johnston and you considered me a social pariah. You told everyone that that was probably why I was valedictorian of our middle school class. You made fun of me because my mom had to use food stamps. I could go on for a good hour for chrissakes." She flinched.

"You can't hate me. Michael, you've been tutoring me for half a year. We spend every day together... You let me watch Return of the Jedi with you..."

"Look. I'm sorry but I tutored you because it was good money for little work. And I let you watch movies with me sometimes because you lingered and I didn't want to be rude. I never thought you'd misconstrue it as mixed signals or something."

She looked like she was dealing with Bernoulli's equation. Out of impulse I almost snapped my fingers at her like I used to during our sessions when she'd zone out. 

Then she did the last thing I expected her to do. Shit. She started to tear up. Over me??? Ava Costa does not tear up over dudes. She eats them for breakfast. She's destined to be the ultimate trophy wife meets black widow. I did not have time for this.

"Look, I'm sorry. I'm moving cross country today anyways. It just wouldn't work." My taxi honked. "I gotta go." She wiped the tears from her face as she looked up at me. She almost reminded me of my long lost best friend. The one who used to squeal when I'd climb up a tree too high. The one who wouldn't even be able to water ballon an elephant standing a foot in front of her. The one who bought me a piggy bank as my 10th bday present so we could "invest" into it for a year and have enough to buy ourselves Super Soakers our parents had prohibited. 

I picked my duffel bags from the floor and walked out, hoping I don't run into her during Christmas break.

#### [WP] You have the ability to reverse time by 6 hours whenever you're about to die. You're currently on a 10 hour flight on a plane that's about to crash.

Score: 447

I made a decent living working for the government.  I never told them how I was able to do it, but I could predict major events and disasters hours before they happened.  But they weren't predictions, they were actually events I experienced.  That's my secret, I'm always reliving time.  Well not always, it's an odd power.

I discovered my ability when I fell through the ice while skating at a lake near our Minnesotan home.  I didn't have the strength to get back to the surface and I felt the lake sucking the life right out of me.  Suddenly everything stopped.  Time froze, and floating in front of my face read the phrase "Load Last Checkpoint?"  I hit Y...with my mind...somehow.  And suddenly I was back at home, waking up that morning.

I quickly learned the specifics of how my power worked.  The split second before I die, time will freeze and let me rewind the last 6 hours.  So when 9/11 happened, I stole my dad's gun and used it.  I called the cops, I called everyone, no one believed me.  Who's going to listen to a guy ranting about a terrorist attack at 5 in the morning?

Obviously the FBI found me afterwards and brought me in to explain myself.  With some clever time travel tricks (Joe will spill his coffee in 3...2...1) I was able to convince them I had psychic powers.  Seemed easier than trying to explain something I never even fully understood.

Over the years I must have stopped hundreds of terrorist attacks, assassinations, and got people evacuated in time before natural disasters.  I always carried a sidearm with me in case of an emergency rewind.  I think I've shot myself over a thousand times in my life.  I finally decided to take a break and go on vacation to Sydney.  Which brings me to the present.  I boarded Oceanic flight 816 to LAX heading home after my much needed vacation.

The in-flight movie was some terrible romcom.  So I watched a personal classic on my laptop.  Hook.  I always related to Peter Pan in that I could live forever,  I could have stayed a young boy if I had wanted to, just constantly replaying a day over and over.  (Tried it once, it gets really boring, I feel sorry for Bill Murray).

I don't know how they found out about me, or my powers.  I've never told a soul about how it works until now.  But somehow they figured it out.  They waited until after we were six hours into the flight before taking over the plane.  The leader told me there was nothing I could do.  They were watching me the entire flight, and any attempt to do anything would have resulted in them tying me up.  I tried everything I could think of.  They were thorough.  Two of them sat on either side of me unbeknownst to me for those six hours.  There was no way I could kill myself.

Everytime I failed, we crashed into the secret nuclear missile facility in Nevada(the *real* Area 51, the one on Google Maps is a fake).  Effectively setting off two hundred nukes and obliterating the entire Western half of the country.  At least, that's what they said was going to happen.  And judging by the explosion right in front of my face everytime time froze, I'd say they were right.

I have spent almost a year trying to find a solution to this problem.  There's no way for me to get back to before the flight took off.  They knew what they were doing and planned this all too well.  It's impossible.  The best I can do is fight my way into the cockpit and lock myself in when they let their guard down.  This plane will never make it to Nevada.

So I write this to inform you that the United States no longer has their safeguard.  They are vulnerable to attacks and assassinations once more.  The masses thought that things were fine since 9/11, when in reality it was all me.

I don't know which reference I want to make for my true last words.  The Captain America parallel is obvious.  Groundhog Day too cliched.  I'm almost out of time now.  We're less than 10,000 feet above the Sierras now.  Down to just a minute or two.  I've lived an amazing life.  More than any man ever has.  I suppose now is as good a time as any.

To die will be an awfully big adventure.

#### [WP] You are the first boss of a videogame who, after accidentally killing the player in their first try, decide to take it upon yourself to fulfill their quest.

Score: 444

The hero had made his way through my keep, torn through my defenses, and brought ruin upon the men who had pledge their lives to me. I had heard of him, as had all the other great Lords, the man who said he would slay a thousand evils in order to bring justice to the world once more. He had good reason to say so. I had heard of his tale; the village in which he hailed had been put to the torch a year ago and his family had perished within. 

My own liege Lord was the one who had done it. He had risen up against other Lords and brought his armies through the countryside, burning the villages, taking the money, and providing food for his soldiers. The war was still ongoing, but he had sent other Lords back home, to quell rebellions rising within his lands.

The hero, as he such called himself, had marched into my throne room, and drawn his sword. He was a stout young fellow, who bore a fresh set of iron-plate armor with barely a scratch on it. A bow and quiver wrapped around his torso, and a sword, covered in blood, was gripped at his side.  "A minion of the Lord Guerknot. You shall be the first to fall among the rest."

I had sat waiting for him. There was no shame in a Lord protecting his home, with his own soldiers throwing their lives before he threw his own. They had pledged themselves to me and it was *their* honor to fall in my name. "I have heard a lot about you Warren. A commoner turned soldier. A man without a family."

He raised his sword, "You do not get to speak ill of the dead!"

"You were on the wrong side of history, Warren. That is all. The wrong side of a war."

"A war that shouldn't exist."

I stood at his comment. He was never pledged to Guerknot like I was, but to speak against my Lord's war was to speak against me. "A war that you perpetuate with killing. These men did not participate in the burning. They did not destroy your village."

"They serve the one who caused it all."

I scoffed. "They serve me! No one else. They guard the people in *my* kingdom, no one else's."

"And you serve Guerknot! You think such a man cares for them? For the people? For even you?"

I laughed. It was something that the war had caused me to think about a lot. I served Guerknot because my family was pledged to them, because it was *my* duty as the Lord of Mountain's Fist to serve him. But the war had caused peril in my country, in my land. Tribesmen were active once more, pillaging and raping my people when I had men across the globe fighting a war that was not theirs to fight. My own vaults dry of coin because I spent it helping the war effort. My fields worked to ash because the troops needed food.

My people going hungry, going cold, and going into the Earth because Guerknot wished to further his Kingdom.

"I agree with you."

He did not seem to like my response as he took an aggressive step forward. "Then why would you let me kill all those men? Kill *your* men!"

I took a few steps forward, stepping down from my throne, "Because the Mountain's Fist does not take kindly to intruders. But if you pledge yourself to me. If you kneel to Wymarc of the Fist then I will provide you with an army. I will let you take revenge."

He faltered. I could see it as he thought about the offer. "This is a trick."

"Tell me, once you killed me, did you intend on taking the throne?" I continued to walk down.

He did not move.

"You'd leave the Kingdom without leaders, and when the job was done, when you finally struck down Guerknot the Besieger. Would you take over? Would you lead the Kingdom?"

Again, he faltered as he realized the truth in my words.

"Let me give you a chance at your revenge. And together, we can take down Guerknot from the inside."

He sat there for a few moments, debating to take my offer. Part of me thought he was going to, that he was happy with only the *thought* of revenge. Yet his actions proved otherwise. He lifted his sword, anger in his face, and he shouted at me. "Liar!"

He charged me, running at me with sword drawn. 

I drew my own and took the last step to even myself with him. As he swung, I ducked and spun at the last second, my cloak flying with me, the symbol of the Fist covering the room. As he turned to face me for another blow, my sword buried into his chest, through his own iron-plate and into his flesh. It did not come out the other side, instead the Sword of the Mountain stuck inside of him.

"You will be with your family again. And for you, and for the others who have fallen," I whispered, "revenge shall be granted."

He took a deep breath, and for a second I thought he smiled. I could see he was losing it, regretting his decision, but happy to be going back to his family. "Thank you."

I pulled my sword out of his chest and took a step backwards. He collapsed immediately onto the steps of my throne and I looked down upon him. He had the right idea, revolting against the Kingdom of Guerknot, but he had done it all wrong. He did not have the army, nor the power, nor the name.

But I did as the Lord of a proud and prestigious House. I had an army that wanted to take back their lands. I had the power of several vassals. And I, as Wymarc of the Mountain's Fist, had the name. In that, I would take back my forefather's Kingdom.

One mountain at a time.

The air smelt faintly of urine.

I leant into the wall, letting the cool bricks catch my weight. The night time rush that would periodically burst from the automatic doors and flood through the Underground station had slowed to a trickle. The pale, washed out corridors all but dried up. 

I pulled my coat tighter across my chest, but the shiver had nothing to do with the cold. The next tube was still a few moments away, and my mind had begun to empty.

I stared at my shoes, unable to grasp whether I liked the shade of brown. It was not as if I was undecided, rather the opposite, I was unequivocally convinced that I had no opinion whatsoever. It was a void that spread through my mind. I quickly became equally ambivalent about the upcoming electoral debate, about what I was going to eat for dinner, about eating dinner at all.

I slouched further down the wall until I was sitting on the damp concrete floor. The colour began to drain around me, like watercolours spread to thinly across a page. Soon I was left with only a wireframe, an indicator of where things should be but not ability to build anything meaningful within the empty space.

I rested my head between my knees pressing inward with my legs, using the pain as an anchor on reality.

Chocolate.

I love chocolate.

A little girl skipped into sight, her face smeared brown and colour bleeding from her footprints, spilling across the platform. Her opinions filled my mind. I hated the smell. I feared the train tracks. I loved unicorns. Her mum followed in toe, running onto the platform and grabbing the girl’s hand. 

The tube screeched to a halt, and as the doors opened I could see once again, through the many lenses crafted by years of unique experience.

People pushed passed me, and I smiled as they built my world.

Shining light emanates from Bartholomew who sits outside God's office. God, the big man, doesn't just see anyone. You either screwed up royally or you knocked it out of the park. Bart knows which one he's here about. He knocked that shit out of the park. The door to God's office opens and beckons him. 

BART COME ON IN AND HAVE A SEAT

Bart does and sits on a cloud. The office is not enclosed as far as he can tell. The door slams shut behind him. While Bart looks vaguely human, God does not really have a form. He or she or it is several blinking lights that looks more like a constellation of stars than anything else. Bart smiles at him. 

THE PLATYPUS, THAT WAS YOUR CREATION, CORRECT?

Odd that an all knowing being is asking him a question, but Bart answers it. 

"Yes, my Lord. Quite proud of it, actually." 

I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY THAT. MY REACTION IS DIFFERENT. THE PLATYPUS IS STUPID. JUST STUPID AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR CREATING IT. IF YOU WEREN'T A GREAT DESIGNER I WOULD SEND YOU TO HELL. 

"Whoa, what? Are you kidding me?"

NO, I HATE IT. 

"It's in Australia. Gabe gave kangaroos three vaginas, and he was promoted. I design something like this, and you're talking about hell. Seriously?"

YES. 

"You knew I would make this. You knew that. You've given me design notes before. Hell, you can guide me without telling me. You can control me. Your self-hating bullshit has gone too far. I made something weird that stands out, and you don't like it?"

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. 

"Adam and Steve was an interesting concept and you ended that right quick anyway."

THERE'S MORE. 

"Like?" Asks Bart. 

THE GIANT SLOTH, THE MOA, THE THUNDERBIRDS, AND THE DINOSAURS. 

"All extinct. You ended them all. Every last one of them. I design life on Earth, remember? If those are my own only mistakes, well, that seems pretty good. Oh wait, you're infallible supposedly. What is this really about? I'm not getting back together with Lucy, threats or not." Says Bart. 

ALRIGHT FINE, I KIND OF LIKE THE PLATYPUS. IT'LL MAKE HUMANS MORE ACCEPTING WHEN THEY FIND THE DUCK PLANET, BUT LUCY IS UPSET. SHE MIGHT NOT TAKE NEW ARRIVALS BECAUSE OF IT. THERE'S NO HOPE FOR RECONCILIATION? 

"It's been two million years. She's nice, but all she talks about is torture and punishment, and I'm sure the sex would have phenomenal if we had genitals, hint hint." 

NO GENITALS FOR ANGELS. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. LOOK AT THE MADHOUSE IT IS ON EARTH BECAUSE OF GENITALS. 

"Good point, but, you know, sex looks great."

IT'S THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING EVER. THAT'S WHY I CREATED HEROIN. 

"Ooo, can I have that?"

NO. I KNEW THAT'S WHERE THIS CONVERSATION WAS GOING, AND I STILL DIDN'T AVOID IT. 

"Says more about you than me." 

YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW, LOOK GIVE HER A CALL, SOMETHING. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

"Yes, sir." 

BTW, I MISS THE DINOSAURS. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BRING THEM BACK. 

"Can do, my Lord."

ALRIGHT, GET OUT OF HERE. 

Bart leaves and goes back to his job. He sends a quick message to Lucy. Bart thinks about the platypus and laughs. He couldn't wait for them to become hyper intelligent and ravage the universe. Lucy would think that's funny. He sends a quick message and gets back to work.

#### [WP] When I was 16 my father pulled me out of school and shoved me in the car. His eyes didn't leave the road as he threw a gun in my lap and said, "We're going to get your mother."

Score: 440

The car door slammed as I reached for the seatbelt. Frightened and confused, I obeyed my father and buckled into my seat. The windshield wipers swiped back and forth, mopping up the downpour as my father ran around to the driver's side of our family's SUV. 

"Hold this," he said as he threw a gun in my lap. "We're going to get your mother."

"Dad, what's going on?" I said. 

Without a word, my father sped out out of the parking lot of my high school and onto the main road leading to downtown. The gun felt heavy in my lap. I was too scared to hold it so I was squeezed it between my thighs. My palms began to sweat as I watched my father's eyes dart left and right as we weaved through the slow traffic yielding to the storm. 

"Dad," I repeated, "What's going on?" 

"Something's happened Nathan and we need to get your mother and get away from here," said my father. 

I had never seen my father act this way. I always thought of my father as the boring, middle aged government worker, who did nothing more than go to and from work, with the same briefcase for the last twenty years. Not today. Today he acted like he just woke from a twenty year long dream. 

"Nathan, he said, "I need you to listen very carefully at what I'm about to tell you."

I turned to my father and quickly made eye contact with him. Studying his eyes, I saw a different man. I nodded. 

"There's been an attack. We don't know who they are, but we know they released it downtown and it is quickly spreading. The symptoms are subtle, a common co--."

Before he could finish, our family's SUV became the bearer of a brunt impact that had run a red light. I clutched the dashboard and center console as we spun around in circles, finally coming to a dead stop in the middle of the intersection. 

Before we could assess the damage, my father grabbed my arm, "You ok?"

Filled with adrenaline and my heart pumping fast through my chest, I nodded again. 

"Son, we're going to have to move on foot, said my father, "grab the gun." 

Without hesitation, I clutched the gun in my hand, turned to my father and nodded once more.

This is bullshit.

What the fuck kind of God thinks this is a funny thing to do to someone? All I do all day is lie in bed and wish I was dead.

Super speed. I know what God's ability is. Super dick...hole...ness. 

"I brought you some milk, sweetheart," my kind, generous, loving mother said as she set the glass down on my bedside table.

"Fuck milk, Mom! I wanna' go outside and do things!"

"Well, I can get the wheelchair and bring you outside," she swooned.

"No! Not the wheelchair mom! I want to go outside without a wheelchair!"

I could see how much this was hurting her. I mean, we both knew that wasn't an option, but shit, I can't keep all this frustration bottled up inside, not even for the woman that gave me life.

But what kind of life is this to have? What kind of gift is it if all I get to do is look at my ceiling and pretend like I know what if feels like to jerk off? It's her fault I'm in this mess, for Christ's sake. 

She looked at her feet and said, "Well, is there anything I can bring you? Anything you'd like to do? You want a coloring book, or a movie?" I sighed, not to keen on berating my mother anymore, even though she's a bitch for giving birth to me.

"It's fine, Mom. I think I just wanna' sleep."

"Alright, well if you need anything, just call." Then she spun around and shut the door with the gentleness of an angel's whisper.

Fuck milk. Seriously. I want a Coke, but doctor's say I can't have any sugary drinks because they fear my super speed my give me super fast diabetes, so for this broken, young, degenerate it's milk, water and at Christmas, sugarless eggnog. 

Instead, I just did what I normally do. Grow my fingernails out with super speed, then chew on 'em. 

Except today was different. For some reason, as I clenched my teeth down on a freshly generated bit of nail material, the satisfaction of that snap didn't rush down my spine like it normally does. Instead it just tasted weird, like dirt. 

Great, now everything sucks.

But then I had an idea. It was a weird idea, a far-fetched idea, but if I could get it to work, it just might be worth it. 

I clenched my bed sheets in my hands and gritted my teeth, focusing all my energy inside my soul, deep down into the cavernous recesses of my brain. I started to shake, my face turned red, and veins on my forehead gained noticeable three-dimensionality.

I looked down. The hair on my arms was beginning to grow in full. My stomach started arching over my waistline. The skin on my limbs was growing increasingly white and washed out. What hair I had on my stomach grew out and began turning gray. I was doing it! It was working! Super speed my aging process!

All I could hope for is that I could age myself right into the grave, but as the energy was flowing through me, something else was going on in my head. I felt my entire life flashing before my eyes. People I'd never met, yet loved more than anyone on the planet. People I'd lost. Children I'd fostered. Pets I'd owned, jobs I'd worked, I saw it all. I saw myself stuck out of time in every situation I'd ever experience, all within the span of a few minutes. 

Then it began. A creeping, ominous feeling, like the lights were going out.

So I stopped. Look at me. A few moments before I was a shiny, young teenager. Now I laid in the same bed as a decrepit old man, scared and confused. After meeting all those faces, watching my kids grow up, seeing what my life had become, suddenly, I didn't want to die. Even if it was all from the perspective of a wheelchair, it was beautiful, visceral, it all made sense. This gift, it really was a gift. God had so much planned for me, an entire, beautiful life totally worth living. My mother going through so much pain just to bring me into this world of experience and beauty. I wanted so much to live it. 

But I already had. Time only goes in one direction. So before I age myself to death, let me tell you something. 

Never try to rush things. Life will come to you. Don't try to meet it halfway.

Also, our God is a rampant asshole for toying with us like this. Just like our mothers, who have the audacity to believe that any child they bring into this world will appreciate it.

Adios.

#### [WP] Death spared your life and made you immortal. Over hundreds of years, you have become friends. He's been very busy with work and you miss seeing your buddy. You spend centuries attempting to create world peace, stop war and cure diseases so you can spend some quality time with your only friend.

Score: 436

Death spared my life once. It was a long time ago - almost so long that I can no longer remember it. The only thing that I can remember is being sick and willing myself not to die. I had a family that needed my support. I was a doctor myself, lying on the floor of an examination room in my own sick and repeating it in my head. *I won't die, I won't die, I won't die.*

He appeared and I thought he was a fever dream. With his black cloak and his scythe - just the way that he had always been described. I let out a sob. "No. No, you can't come for me. Not yet. I won't let you take me."

Death had no face. "I'm not here to take you. I'm here because I've never seen someone with this...resilience." The fever dream shivered, moving in the light of the doctor's office. "Are you really alive?" 

"Please," I begged. "Spare me." 

The fever dream dragged a finger across my cheek - ice against my burning skin that made me convulse and jerk and twitch on the ground. 

Then he was gone. 

I healed from the illness - one of the rare few who did. As I cleaned the sick up from my office I wondered about the hallucination. At the very end of it though I had the opportunity to go back. I went and held my wife and my three children and I went to work and I earned enough money to keep them all happy in those desolate times. The economy came and went - my children grew - and I aged very well.

In fact, it wasn't until I was about sixty that I noticed I hadn't aged at all. My wife seemed to notice it first, remarking that my skin still seemed as smooth as it had fifty years ago when we'd met. She remarked that it seemed like I was still a young man. 

She left me soon after - thought I'd been touched by the devil. She took the children with her, and then I was alone. I quit my practice and lived off the streets, wandering at night and looking at all the homeless and the dying that laid out on the curbs. I threw myself into a river but the icy water did little more than make me shiver, climbing out some frozen popsicle of a man. 

The gun left but a mark in my stomach. The rope left but a burn around my neck. 

One day, the fever dream came back. But this time I was sat on a bridge and looking over at the sunset. He came and leaned against the barrier and I looked up at him and said, "You were never a dream."

"No. I was never a dream."

"How long has it been?"

"Seventy years, eighty?"

"But you haven't come back for me?"

"I made my choice with you. You are what you are. You can never go back." 

"Then I'll have to watch the rest of them die."

"It's the unfortunate consequence. A parent watching their children die. Then their grandchildren. Eventually the grandchildren's grandchildren. You won't die. You will never die. Sometimes you'll wish you did - I know that I've been lonely a few times over the years. Maybe that's why I chose you," he seemed to be speaking more to himself than to me now. "Maybe it was just a split second decision. But your determination to live was...*impressive*, at least." 

"And they'll all die."

"Yes. They will all die." 

I stared out at the river, and then turned back to death. But he was gone. 

He came every few months to see me after that. We talked sometimes. I made him tea from my house. I invested and played the new stock market. I went back to being a doctor for a while, and then quit while I waited for everyone who had ever known me to die. Then I went back to being a doctor. The technology changed, but people remained fairly the same.

Death and I played chess. Death and I read books synchronously and then spoke about them in enthused voices as we threw back shots of vodka. Death and I spoke on the eaves of war and then he would disappear completely for years. I spent the time reading tomes of books and watching the new media as it first came out - first the VHS and then the DVD and then the VR and the IR and the CR. I read the complete *Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire*. I went though all the classics when the books were published. I traveled and let my beard grow as I went from library to library. I touched the oldest of runes. I touched runes before they were runes.

Death always found me, when he was ready to see me again. We would sit and drink and play chess and talk about everything and nothing. Death would tell me about his job and I would tell him about being a doctor, and he would make a remark or two about how it was funny for friends to be a protector of life and a taker of it. 

He was my friend. 

Three hundred years after he took my ability to die the hundred-year war began. I didn't see death for a century. He came to me one day while I was sitting in former Cambodia - the A.A.C.S flag flying overhead with its eight points and its colorless, drafty tone. 

"Been a while," I said. 

"Up for a game of chess?"

"Are you going to leave again?" 

"Only if there's another war." 

There was another war, and then another. The war against the AIs. The war between the A.A.C.S and the N.A.C.U.S that ended in the death of almost two hundred million people. Death was busy, and I was lonely. I went back to sitting on bridges and looking out. I could see the bridges as I couldn't have four or five hundred years before - through the teachings of Aristotle and Plato and the wisdom of musicians, actors, and politicians. I could think of a hundred different answers to the meaning of life but I had no one to share them with. 

Death came back one day. "Chess?" he dropped into the chair like one of the corpses he collected and I pulled out my chessboard.

"I've missed you."

"Yes. It's lonely to go so long without a friend." 

"I wish you weren't so busy."

"As long as man exists, there will be someone for me to take. It's the burden that I was given."

"Given by whom?"

"By whomever is my creator. Yours too, I suppose. *The* creator." 

I mull it over in my head as Death takes one of my rooks. After all these centuries there's still nothing that we do but play chess. Game after game after game of chess. 

It dawns on me that if I want to spend more time with Death I need to fix the problem of war. 

Of course, there is the issue of what Death said. As long as there are people, there will be war. 

I have read many books. I have studied many subjects. I have been alone with my thoughts for many years.

I know the most simple solution to that problem.

"Velkom to ze Hoodraulic Press Shannel. Today we are going to crushing this John. He is very annoying as you can see," the man said as I squirmed in the chair.

The scent of blood was trapped in my throat by the thick band of tape wrapped around my face. An opening scarcely more than a slit by my nose caused my breath to come in thin wheezes, further inhibited by the liquid caking the inside of my broken nose. 

Letting out a brief whimper, I heard him sigh again at the noise.

"You see chat I mean?" he addressed the invisible audience, "I think ve should get on and crush it."

*He couldn't be serious.* From somewhere above me, the machinery rose in pitch, a high whine cutting across the rumble of the motors, and I knew what was descending upon me.

At first first contact my hair was flattened against my head, the pressure then increasing on my scalp as my head was pushed downwards. The force increased and my chin collided my my chest, straining the muscles in my spine. 

I was hunched over further and the press continued downwards, forcing my chest into my knees and stretching my shoulders away from my hands which had been tied behind the chair. 

And still the push became stronger. 

I felt the first vertebrae pop somewhere in my lower back, directly below the column. Crying out in muffled agony, a ripple of cracks arched up my spine and my legs went numb as I felt my abdomen turn warm, a wet rush inside me as my pelvis compressed.

My legs splayed out to one side as I continued to scream, my entire body now on fire as my brain struggled to interpret the signals it was receiving. I tugged at myself and something slopped onto the floor below. Through the clouds I saw a pile of string sausages linked together. How odd for him to put something like that down there. *Why hadn't I noticed before?*

Huh. Odd how I feel hot and cold at the same time.

As the darkness gripped at me with fingers of ice, I heard him laughing along with the woman beside him.

#### [WP] A man orders a "cheese pizza with no crust" from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine.

Score: 401

“Thirty five.” 

The kid, whose baseball cap was on backwards like it was the middle of the nineties again, was holding  a bundle under his arm, wrapped up in a brown paper bag that was way too small to be a pizza. 

“Alright, I get it. I thought I was funny. It wasn't funny. I didn't actually want a block of cheese kid, it was a joke.”

“Thirty five.”

This time he held his hand out, the look on his face speaking volumes about how much he didn't want to deal with this shit right now. 

“Alright, alright, but thirty five is a little steep for cheese you know? What kind of cheese costs that much?” 

If I was being honest, I didn't buy cheese often enough to know first hand how much a block could cost. The only things in my fridge at that time were some condiments, a few bottles of light beer and leftovers from three weeks ago that I kept convincing myself would be fine to eat whenever I got around to it. Maybe I should have actually bought a pizza tonight instead of being a smart ass and loosing thirty five dollars for a damn block of cheese.  

Fishing my wallet out of my back pocket, I held out a fifty and raised a brow at the teen. “You got any change?”

Suddenly clutching the bag more closely now, his eyes narrowed and he shifted his feet, glancing out at the road as though to be sure nobody was there waiting for him. 

“No, you idiot, it's thirty five thousand, how new are you at this? Is this a fucking sting?”

“What the hell are you talking about? No cheese costs that much! It was a prank call, I never thought you guys would fill the order!”

“Wh—cheese? Wait, who the fuck places a prank call order for a kilo of coke?!”

His voice was hushed, but he was screaming as much as a person could hope to in the midst of whispering like this was some sort of dr--- What!?

“No, no way. That is not what I ordered. I did not order that. Is that what you have in the bag!? I ordered a cheese pizza with no crust!”

“Yeah!” the kid was hissing now, fingers clenching anxiously against the brown paper. “Exactly, and that's code for a kilo of coke. If I bring this back my boss is going to have my ass!”

Holding my hands up, I took a stride back into the house and shook my head. “Well I don't have that kind of money!”

A police cruiser rolled down the street, and I could only imagine that I looked like as much of a deer in the headlights as I thought I did, because the delivery driver grit his teeth and ground under his breath a stern. “Hand me the fifty bucks.” Operating on auto pilot, my eyes still locked none so subtly on the police car, I held out the hand that the bill was crumpled in and dropped the sweaty thing into his hand. 

Shoving the bag into my arms, the kid caught my eye and held it with an intensity I didn't even think possible on that pock ridden face. “Now,” he muttered. “I'll be back for the rest of that money in a week, so you better start getting real creative.”

As he jogged back to the beat up old Honda haphazardly parked at the end of the driveway, I somehow managed to shut the door behind him. 

--------------------------------

“Sir?” Snapped back to the present, I blinked at the travel agent in her smart pantsuit and wondered briefly if she took her job too seriously.  “Sir, you said Mexico is where you'd like to book a cruise to? Anything particular you're looking for from your trip?”

“Oh...” Scratching the back of my neck and chuckling under my breath, I shrugged. “You know, tacos and shit. I love Mexican food. You can uh, only eat so much pizza right?”

I eyed the piece of bacon on my plate suspiciously. It looked more like a bacon-shaped and bacon-scented dog treat than *actual* bacon. "Honey, what is this?"

She slid the eggs out of the frying pan onto my plate and made a regretful face. "I know, I'm sorry. It's some kind of soy bacon. Some environmental terrorists managed to get ahold of one of the time warp portals and went back to fiddle with the 1950s. Somehow they managed to convince the U.S. Government that meat products were related to communism or something. I didn't have time to read the report very closely. The point is that everything is vegetarian now. Even the eggs are..." She sneered at the pile of yellow on my plate, "well, I don't exactly know what they are. Should be fixed by lunch though."

I sighed and bit into the bacon. It had the texture of rubber, and the taste wasn't too far off either. Damn time meddlers. Every day some other crazy group decides to go back and change things, thinking that maybe no one in the present will notice. It seems like I constantly wake up in the Third Reich when some stupid college kid builds a closet time machine and goes back to make Hitler a martyr or something. I could deal with a little soy bacon if that was going to be the worst of today's time corrections. 

"What are you plans for today, honey?" I asked, biting into my toast. At least strawberry jam was the same. 

"Paul has that field trip today for science class," she said. "Cretaceous period." She nodded over to the plastic suits in the corner that would pretty much immobilize our son while he was back in time. Wouldn't want someone stepping on the wrong little mammal or something like that. "The school is requiring twice the normal number of parents after the American Revolution incident." I rolled my eyes. Some punk in our daughter's class had decided that the lamp from Old North Church would make for a nice souvenir and had accidentally prevented America from ever existing. Boy, the Time Rectification Division had *not* been happy about that and even threatened to cancel all time trips for every student in the district. Luckily the History department had enough clout with the administration to make sure that didn't happen.

I checked my watch. "Well, hon, as much as I loved eating my blobs of soy," I grinned as she scowled at me, "I must be off to work." I grabbed my keys, gave her a kiss, and headed towards the door. 

She waved the morning time rectification report at me. "Take the I-16 instead of your normal route. It looks like..." she studied the screen a bit closer, "Wow, that's a doozy. Someone apparently went back to pre-Columbian America and formed an empire for themselves. The Rectification Division is still getting rid of the monumental statues where the highway used to be." I rolled my eyes. More megalomaniacs going back and playing god with advanced technology. 

I headed out to my car. Just as I reached for the door handle, everything began to shimmer in a time slip. "Oh, come on!" I growled, checking my watch again. With the traffic diversion, I was *already* going to be late. 

When everything solidified again, my gleaming new car was gone, replaced by what looked like an old steam-powered Model-T. "Great," I grumbled, sliding into the seat and trying to work the bellows enough to get this pile of junk moving. Yet another day where someone decides to fix global warming by preventing humans from every using fossil fuels. "Just fucking great."

*A young woman walks through a narrow corridor, carrying two steaming cups of coffee in her hands. This is CHEYENNE, a graduate student. She taps a plastic badge on a card-reader with her hip, then pushes her way into a small office.*

**CHEYENNE:** Hey, Frank? Are you around?    
**FRANK:** (*O.S.*) No! Go away!

*Cheyenne smiles to herself as she walks around a large filing cabinet. Behind it is a diminutive man sitting at a desk covered in print-outs.*

**CHEYENNE:** Well, darn. I guess I'll have to drink this coffee myself, then.

*Frank looks up at the white cups.*

**FRANK:** Oh, alright. Give it here, then.    
**CHEYENNE:** What are you working on?    
**FRANK:** It's another bloody send-back from the BODC. They claim our reports are invalid.    
**CHEYENNE:** Invalid? How? We're using their equipment!    
**FRANK:** That's not even the weirdest bit. Are you ready for this?

*A moment of tense silence passes.*

**FRANK:** (*CONT'D*) Well, are you?    
**CHEYENNE:** Oh, sorry, I thought you were being rhetorical.    
**FRANK:** I was, in fact, but I wouldn't mind your participation.    
**CHEYENNE:** (*Sighing*) Yes, Frank, I'm ready. What's up?

*Frank snatches a piece of paper from his desk and holds it out to Cheyenne.*

**FRANK:** Look at the forwards on this email.    
**CHEYENNE:** NASA? What the hell do they have to do with oceanography?    
**FRANK:** Probably something to do with the tides.    
**CHEYENNE:** "Tides?"    
**FRANK:** Well, I don't know, do I?!

*Cheyenne glances around the office.*

**CHEYENNE:** Why have you been printing out your emails, anyway?    
**FRANK:** Ah, that's the tricky bit. It seems as though our server has started erasing messages of its own accord.    
**CHEYENNE:** (*Skeptically*) Really.    
**FRANK:** Yes, really.    
**CHEYENNE:** Are you sure you didn't delete them by accident?    
**FRANK:** Quite sure, thank you... and what's more, everything that's missing had a reference to the same topic.

*Another moment of silence passes. Cheyenne sighs.*

**CHEYENNE:** What topic is that, Frank?    
**FRANK:** The Puerto Rico trench. I've checked, and the only records we've retained about the area have to do with volcanic activity. There's no other data.    
**CHEYENNE:** You make it sound like someone is clearing things out on purpose.    
**FRANK:** I'm rather convinced they are, actually... but lucky for us, I've kept hard copies of everything interesting.    
**CHEYENNE:** What constitutes "interesting?"

*Frank swivels around in his chair, scanning his immediate area. He points to a large scrapbook at the top of the filing cabinet, which Cheyenne retrieves. Frank opens the book and flips to one of the middle pages.*

**FRANK:** Right, here we are. These are images taken by a robotic submersible some three or four years back. They're nowhere in the database, even though there's a log number.

*He taps a small section of text on the page. Cheyenne leans in closer, squinting at the photographs.*

**CHEYENNE:** If I didn't know better, I'd say that looks like...    
**FRANK:** (*Interrupting*) Yes, well, it clearly isn't. It would have to be truly gargantuan, after all. Perhaps large enough to move the entire planet.    
**CHEYENNE:** The resemblance is rather striking, though.    
**FRANK:** Quite. That's why it was originally dubbed "The Engine." Not that you'll find any reference to it now, of course.

*A look of mild horror flashes across Cheyenne's face.*

**CHEYENNE:** Frank, do you have images like this for every ocean trench on Earth?    
**FRANK:** Somewhere around here, yeah. Why?    
**CHEYENNE:** Think about their locations relative to the planet.    
**FRANK:** ... I'm afraid I don't know what you're getting at, love.

*Cheyenne pantomimes holding a globe in her hands.*

**CHEYENNE:** If you wanted to pilot a planet-sized object, you'd need thrusters in specific locations, right?    
**FRANK:** Surely you're not suggesting that the Earth is some kind of colossal ship.

*The two stare at each other for a moment.*

**CHEYENNE:** No. No, that would be silly, wouldn't it?    
**FRANK:** Incredibly silly. Why, the very act of moving it would strip the atmosphere and kill everything on the surface. 

*He closes the book and shakes his head.*

**FRANK:** (*CONT'D*) I'll tell you, though, I'm going to reach out to some friends at NASA. If they're influencing the BODC, I want to know why.    
**CHEYENNE:** I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of things.    
**FRANK:** I will, as well. Maybe I'll find another engine, eh?

*Cheyenne smiles appreciatively, then moves to sit at her desk on the opposite side of the room. Neither she nor Frank notice the blinking red light in the vent above them.*

"Turn right here," said Hobbes. Calvin turned left, and Hobbes groaned again.

"I believe that we shouldn't follow other people's advice unless they can give a very good reason."

"We've never been this way," said Hobbes. "We don't know what might be in front of..."

"And even then, we should stand up for ourselves," said Calvin. He let go of the wagon handle and smack his fist into the palm of his hand for emphasis.

"It's a cliff! Stop!" yelled Hobbes.

"We should be given the right to make our own mistakes. To go the road less traveled by--"

"Stop-stop-STOP!"

"--to learn the hard way. To--"

But Calvin never got a chance to finish his speech. For at that moment, the wagon tipped over a steep cliff, and kid and tiger and wagon flew into the air. Each arced through the air in a graceful fall and landed squarely in a prickly bush in the ravine below. 

"See," said Calvin, "if I had never ignored your advice, we would never have known not to come this way."

"What a success," grumbled Hobbes, sitting up gingerly. "I think I bruised my spine."

"I thought you said tigers always land on their feet," said Calvin as he brushed twigs out of his hair.

"We do," said Hobbes, "but it's impossible to land on your feet when you land on a thistle bush. Wait a minute--" 

"What?"

Hobbes got to his feet and looked around suspiciously. "Someone's been eating this recently." He pointed to a branch that seemed to have been bitten off.

"Huh," said Calvin. "Can you grab the wagon? I can't reach it without scratching myself."

"Get it yourself," snapped Hobbes. 


* * *

The two friends, dragging a red wagon with one bent wheel, made their way down the ravine in the afternoon light. Presently the walls of the ravine fell away and they found themselves in a section of the woods they had never been before. It was pleasant and green and thick with trees. Hobbes looked about curiously and sniffed.

"See," said Calvin. "Mistakes let you go places you never would have otherwise."

"Shut up," said Hobbes, rubbing his back. "What's this?"

There in front of them was a wooden door built into the bottom of tree. Above the doorway was written "Mr Sanders." Hobbes noticed that the last "s" was backwards. 

"Let's find out," said Calvin. He tried the door, and it swung open easily.

"Wait! You can't just walk in," said Hobbes. "What if somebody lives there?"

"Oh, don't be such a girl," said Calvin and dragged the reluctant tiger inside.

It looked as though someone did, in fact, live there. The floor was wood, comfortable-looking furniture was scattered about, and a pleasantly sweet smell filled the place. A clock on the wall pointed to 10:55, but it wasn't ticking.

"We shouldn't be here," said Hobbes nervously.

Before Calvin could answer there was a noise at the door. They both spun around to see a young boy standing at the doorway. He wore shorts and had messy brown hair that was longer than Calvin's. 

"What are you doing here?" frowned the boy. He had a funny accent.

"Hey," said Calvin. "Are you Mr. Sanders?"

"No. Mr. Sanders used to live here, but now my friend does. Are you burglars?"

"Just apologize and let's leave," said Hobbes.

"No, it's alright, as long as you didn't steal anything," said the boy. He turned to look at Hobbes and smiled.
Both Calvin and Hobbes jumped. People always ignored Hobbes. He was always very proud of this--humans are afraid of tigers (as they should be), and people ignore things they're scared of. But now, here was this boy, staring right at him. And smiling.

"You're friends with a tiger?" the boy said to Calvin. "I don't know anyone besides me who has animal friends."
Hobbes shook himself and stepped forward, extending his paw. "I'm Hobbes, and this is Calvin."

"I'm Christopher Robin," said the boy. "Do you want to play?"


* * *

If you were to go on a walk through the Hundred-Acre Wood that day, you might just have seen two young boys playing. But if you looked closely, you would realize that it wasn't just two boys--there were also animals: a quiet bear, a shy young pig, a tiny but enthusiastic kangaroo, two tigers, and many more. And if you really payed attention, you might have even seen an owl swoop silently overhead.

You would have seen a heffalump hunt and a baseball game. A game where it seemed like everyone was making up the rules as they went along, and another where everyone dropped sticks off of a bridge to see which one got to the other side faster. The bear who lived in the Mr Sanders house even recited several pieces of his own poetry. 


* * *


Finally, when it was getting dark, the brown-haired boy had to go home. One by one the other animals said goodbye and wandered off until just the blond-haired boy and the taller tiger remained. Calvin picked up the handle of his wagon and sighed. 

"Those were some strange people!" said Calvin.

"Nice though," said Hobbes.

"True," said Calvin. "And there was another tiger!"

"Hm," sniffed Hobbes. "I didn't much like him. He tackled me during CalvinBall. You don't know what it's liked to be flattened out of nowhere by a giggling orange blur."

Calvin snorted. 

"The bear was nice, though," continued Hobbes. "And dropping the sticks off the bridge was fun."

"Poohsticks, yeah, I guess," said Calvin. "But isn't it a little self-centered to name a game after yourself?"

Hobbes cleared his throat but didn't say anything. He looked around. "How do you suppose we get home from here?"

"No, no, we can't go home yet!" said Calvin. "Rosalyn will never find us here."

#### [WP] The invasion of Earth has finally begun but it is not the humans who are putting up the fiercest resistance.

Score: 364

As the mother ship, 2000 meters long and covered with bulbuos spines, approached inner orbit, captain k'rac of the imperium of zel, conquerer of a hundred worlds and slayer of the crab nebula hordes, was signaled by one of the communications officers on the bridge.

"We are approaching our designated landing point, captan" clicked the prawn like navigator.

"Good" rumbled k'rac. "How long before we land on terra?"

"Approximately 20,000 flashes of a pulsar, " replied the officer, performing and double checking the minute calculations needed to breach orbit. 
"The swarm mother's larva have reported that the dominant species, known as "homo sapiens", are stupid and weak, only using crude ballistic and nuclear weapons".

"Wonderful!" chuckled (or as close to chuckling as a giant shrimp could) k'rac. "Agitate the hives, wake the dirgecallers, and prepare the photon mortars, this will be a slaughter!" As he began to leave the bridge and make his report to the monarch, k'rac turned back, as an afterthought struck him "Where does our first battle begin?"

"An island, uninhabitable by humans in the center and a good landing point, clicked the underling. "The dominant ape species here calls it..." 
the communications officer squinted at the hazy intercepted maps, taken from rogue satellites flung out of earths orbit;

"Australia"

Somewhere beneath the White House - in a basement that doubled as a bomb shelter - the President and his most trusted advisors met. He sat tapping his fingers against the table in agitation as the others argued.

"They may try to destroy us if we send them a sign of weakness," a general said. The Secretary of State and Vice President exchanged looks.

"Mr. President, are you bored?"

He turned his gaze to them with his eyebrows up. "I just don't know what kind of aliens they think they are. They aren't that smart. They aren't that great. Don't they know? America is a great country and they can't even get the numbers right."

"The...the numbers?" asked the Vice President. 

The President laughed. "Why, they say they want to be the *fifty-first* state. That's too funny. They obviously didn't learn their history well 'cause there are *already* fifty-one states." 

The room fell quiet. 

The secretary of state leaned over to the general. "Perhaps," he whispered, "it would be best if we play along, and come up with the real plan later."

#### [WP] A guy sells his soul to the devil, but the guy is the best lawyer in the world and manages to turn the deal around.

Score: 354

"Alright, there's one final stipulation before you sign the dotted line," said the lawyer, shuffling the paper on the desk. They were specialized, made from a substance that could not be burned, and the wood fiber ones typically erupted into flame after five to six minutes in Hell. 

"Which is?" Said an exasperated Devil, swishing his tail left and right with impatience. 

"That in the future, when I come to pay you my soul, I can exchange any soul considered to be greater than my own if I can bring them down to this room."

"Who gets to decide if they're greater?" Said the Devil, his eyes squinted in suspicion. 

"You do, you do of course. Think of it as a way to get more for your money. Now, I'm ready for you to sign."

The devil pulled out his pen, made from black obsidian, and the ink made from things far worse typically found within the human body. With a swishing signature he wrote his name, smoke curling up from the letters as the ink dried. 

"And here," said the lawyer, "And here. Here too."

Fifteen minutes later, and thirty seven signatures later, they were finished. The devil smiled, knowing it was now a waiting game. That for the cheap price of a billion dollars, the most beautiful woman in the state, and a successful career, he was now one soul up. 

All he had to do was wait for the man to die. 

***

Eighty six years passed. Humans now lived longer than they used to, meaning their debt took longer to pay, which was wreaking havoc in his soul finances and flow team. 

The knock came boldly before the lawyer stepped in, wrinkles crossing his face, a smoldering cane at his side. 

"Was it worth it?" Asked the Devil as the lawyer entered the room. 

"Indeed. I would say that is was."

"We'll see if you say that in a thousand years!" Replied the Devil, as he fetched a pair of glowing red handcuffs. 

"But wait!" Said the lawyer, "I've brought another soul to this room, like we agreed upon. One greater than I, and I demand a trade!"

"A trade?" Said the Devil, looking to the left and right, "But there is no one else here."

"But there is! *You* are here, and I'd like to trade my soul for yours!"

"Ridiculous," said the Devil, "I won't accept that."

"You have to.  You signed here," the lawyer pulled the packet from his briefcase, yellow sticky notes covering the pages, "It says I can trade my souls for any greater soul in this room. Unless, of course, you consider my soul to be more valuable that yours."

The Devil's jaw clenched as he sat in his chair, and the lawyer spoke again. 

"Well, is it?  Is mine more valuable?"

"No," hissed the devil through his pride, as the lawyer turned to leave. Before the door shut he called out to him, "You'll still burn in Hell! You didn't escape that!"

From the door the lawyer nodded with a smile. 

"I'm a lawyer. I expected no less, so this was the best deal I could get."

#### [WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.

Score: 351

It all started twenty years ago, when a drug-fueled teenager with a temper came across a young boy sitting on a wheelchair, all by himself in a deserted park on a Sunday evening.

"What you doing out here by yourself?" I said, staggering over to him.

"Hi," he said. "Doc said I've got two days left, so mom's taking me around the neighborhood. You know, see some friends, say goodbyes."

"Where's your mom now?"

He looked like he wanted to shrug but his shoulders were too weak. "Dunno. Buying something from the store, I guess."

"Listen, man, you got any money?" I said. Without waiting for an answer, I began  undoing the clasp of his watch.

"Hey, what're you—don't take that! My dad gave me that!" He grabbed my wrist with a limp hand. Before I knew what I was doing, I punched him across the face.

"Don't touch me," I roared. "You're going to die anyway!"

"No," he said, only to be met by another punch. "Please—"

"Let go!" Our tugging led to him toppling from his wheelchair. In my blind rage, I began kicking him in the belly. He squealed, almost like a piglet, from each blow. His legs, which had been still the entire time, began to thrash as well.

Finally, pulling my arms free from his hands, I ran. I didn't even think about my actions then.

It was only two days later that I realized what I'd done just for a couple of beers. He would've been dead by now, but only because I'd killed him.

***

'cept the poor bastard didn't die. I only remembered because he appeared in the news, hale and hearty, standing proud beside his weeping mother. Every paper, every channel, was calling him a miracle.

Of course, back then I thought so too. Now, years later, I knew better. I stood before a wall in my room plastered with newspaper cuttings and magazine articles, of children who've been on the brink of death and lived. Men who've had limbs detached, only to regain them with little more trouble than simply sticking the parts back on. Women wasted away by disease, now out in the world doing great things.

All because of me.

I strode in front of the mirror and struck a pose: pecs trust out, hands on my hips, butt to the side. I've gone by so many names. The Man Who Punches Cancer. Germbeater. Hospital Crasher.

But most recently, I'd been officially given a designation by the city, after I saved more than sixty dying children at a care center.

I am the Bad Touch.

And it was time for me to go to work.

***

"Don't worry," I said to the parents standing by the bed. They always worried, for some reason. "This won't hurt a bit."

The mother bit her lips and nodded, allowing her husband to pull her back.

Their daughter lay before me, comatose. A horrible fall had broken something in her skull. Doctors couldn't do anything, which was where I came in. Well, I usually came in whether they wanted me to or not. Hospital Crasher. Good health before the whims of man.

"Here comes the bad touch!" I shouted, and slammed both fists into her chest.

She jerked awake with a cry. At once, the nearby doctors and nurses came running, along with security. I only had a bit of time before their hesitation to chase me away was overruled by protocol.

"Don't worry, dearie," I told the coughing girl, patting my biceps. "My slabs'll take care of you." With that, I threw a flurry of punches into her face, burying her in the folds of her pillow. Her mother sobbed behind me as her father comforted her.

Within minutes, it was over. She was dancing with her laughing and crying parents, and security guards were half-heartedly chasing me from the building. I ran with a spring in my steps, head held high. Another child saved. Death denied once more.

My next target was across town, at an old facility, requiring me to take a cab. This request had come in my email. Young boy, dying of cancer, paralyzed. The guards let me in without a word. Strange, usually they asked a ton of questions.

As a nurse led me to the third floor, I couldn't help but feel uneasy at the state of the place. It was rundown; filled with outdated equipment, grim-looking staff and few patients at all. Once, I even saw a rat slip out from a crack in the wall to dash among slippers.

"In here," she said, opening a door to a ward. Right after I walked in, she slammed the door behind me and locked it. I gave it no thought, however. A kid here needed my help.

He was sitting by the window, on a wheelchair, looking outside with dull eyes. His body was emaciated, and he didn't even turn his head when I knelt by his side.

"Son, you're a real champ," I told him quietly. "But you're in for a beating."

"I thought so too," said a voice behind me.

I spun around to face a young, clean-shaven man wearing an expensive-looking suit. He was smiling and fingering a tarnished watch on his wrist.

"Who're you?" I said.

He smiled even wider and gestured at the boy. "I'm not what's important right now. Doctors say he only has two days. Can I watch you work?"

"Two days is plenty," I said, standing up. "Answer my question."

"Don't you remember me? I used to sit in a chair like that, once. Until someone tried to rob me."

That watch ... the pieces clicked into place in my mind. "You? What're you doing here? What's all this?"

He shrugged and swept his hand around. "This dump? I own this place. You gave me a second chance, and I wasn't going to waste it."

"Emerson Care," he announced suddenly. "That's my name, by the way. I never got the chance to tell you. Or thank you."

My eyes went wide. "Emerson. Lucas Emerson? You're on the city's medical board. You own ... you own almost all the private hospitals here."

"And care centers, treatment centers, pharmacies, medical research labs ... the list goes on. You see, ever since you saved my life, I've been a tad ... interested in healthcare."

"Good to hear that," I said, preparing to flex my muscles. Corporate executives loved that.

He pursed his lips. "Yeah, not so great when someone's running around town healing everyone. Occupancy rate's shit these days. Profits are down, and I can barely keep the lights running in some of them. This place, for instance."

That sense of unease tripled. "Why have you brought me here?"

Lucas grinned, but his eyes were cold. "People don't need a miracle, Bad Touch. We aren't designed to live forever. When old age comes, people need beds, and rest, and medicine. I give them all that. I don't need a charlatan taking all that away from them. You're a false prophet. And I cannot allow you to keep doing what you do."

The door opened once more, and two men in suits came in. Both were huge and intimidating.

"Way I see it, you have a choice." Lucas pointed at the child behind us. "You can keep healing them. I'm not against that. I don't forget my roots. But you do it when I say you do. I don't lose all my profits; you get to keep some of them alive. Win-win."

"And if I refuse?" I said, fists clenched.

"Then we'll see if your own fists work on you." He snapped his fingers, and his men strode toward us. "But think fast. Consider your time window ... terminal."

#### [WP] You applied for a job at google, everything goes well and only one interview remains: They'd just like an explanation for your search history.

Score: 345

The knock on my door came like a blast of thunder. I jumped up in my armchair and looked at the time. Eight past midnight.

"Who's that?" I called. The armchair was so soft I didn't want to get up for no good reason.

"I'm Ms. Vernon from Google. We scheduled an interview today, remember?"

I groaned and shambled to the door. "You're six hours late. Can't you come back—"

The moment I unlocked the door, a pair of bulky robots burst inside and grabbed hold of my arms. Following them was a middle-aged woman all dressed in black.

"What're you doing to me? Let me go!" I shouted.

"Your interview has begun," she said sweetly. "I suggest that you watch your tone."

The robots dragged me to the living room and forced me into my armchair, while Ms. Vernon perched herself on the piano stool. When they were certain I wasn't going to try and run, the robots released my arms and stepped back.

"You can't just bring your private enforcers into my home," I said. "I have rights—"

"You signed your rights away in the job application contract, remember?" She waved a Google tablet before me, the offending document on display. "Along with your rights to sue for any bodily harm caused, so I suggest you behave yourself."

"I thought I was supposed to meet one of your top executives," I said. "Who are you?"

"I'm the special assistant to our COO," she said, swiping her fingers over the tablet. "But that's not for discussion. We're actually pretty impressed with your scores. Why, I'd say you're almost a prodigy, especially for a fifty-year-old man."

"Do you manhandle all your star applicants?"

"No," she said, voice cold. "Only the ones with a suspect search history."

I gulped; despite my earlier bravado and indignation, I knew I was in true danger now. Even as she slid her tablet across the coffee table to me, I was tensing up.

"Explain—" she said. "—why you don't have a search history."

My jaw worked soundlessly as I looked at the robots. Their red eye slits watched me impassively. Someone had turned the inside of my mouth into a desert. "I—I—"

"Nothing at all," she said. "Not a single search performed on Google in your entire life. How is that possible in the twenty-second century?"

I could only shake my head.

"We even checked the archives of Bing during the days before we bought Microsoft. Nothing from you. Where did you learn to code? How do you even use the Internet?"

"I don't," I said, face flushing. "I—I visit libraries. I borrow a lot of books—really, I can show you my study—"

"Pretend for one second that I'm an idiot," she said. "That I believe your horseshit about books. How do you remember everything you read? The primary needs of mankind are Google search and wifi, before even food. How do you survive without using a search engine?"

I licked my lips. "I go outside. A lot. I buy things from stores, I talk to professors, I borrow books. I can show—"

"Liar. You've done something to conceal your search history." She snapped her fingers, and the robots seized me again. "But Google knows. Google always knows. We'll find the truth."

"I'm not lying," I screamed. "I haven't even switched my computer on for a day!"

"You use your phone."

"I use my phone for calls!"

Her eyes widened. "You monster."

"I'm speaking the truth! Please, no, please ..." My pleas and tears went unanswered as they marched me out of the door.

All around us, my neighbors watched silently through the lens of their phones. No doubt they were using VideoGoogle to discover my crime. The only thing I'd ever wanted was to work at Google like my father before me. But the woman's eyes told me all I needed to know. I, the last of the Zuckerbergs, had just failed my entire line.

#### [WP] You are a hero with a strange power. Every time you raise your hand in a catching position, a voice yells a party nickname for you and a drink or drug tossed into your hand with impressive speed and accuracy. This is your epic.

Score: 343

It started at a party a while back.  Lots of people, loud music, hot, sweaty.  A good party.  I was dancing with this babe, seemed to making some progress with her.  There was a pause between the tunes and she asked if I would get her something to drink.  I was not about to leave her, so I looked over to where the beer cooler was, stuck my hand up and shouted "somebody beer me".

From somewhere I heard someone say "Bob-bay" and a beer hit my hand.  I was at a party, that's how it's supposed to go.  It handed it to her and I could tell beer wasn't really her drink.  Just then another song started.  It was one of my current favs and I shot my hand up in the air in appreciation.  "Bobster!" I heard over the tune, and a bottle hit my hand. Somehow I reflexively caught the bottle.  I looked at in surprise, and my dance partner took it with a thankful look in her eye.

That was the beginning.  It took me a little bit to "get" what was happening. I don't understand why it's happening, mind you, only the process.  I stick my hand up in the air, I heard a voice from somewhere shouting a variation on my name or some other nickname, and some type of "party substance" hits my open hand with amazing speed and accuracy, and I catch it every time.

It was fun at first.  I'm hot and thirsty?  Pow, beer.  I want to relax, a fat joint.  I want to party...you get the idea.  It's almost always appropriate to the situation I'm in or who I'm with. Its made me a very popular guy to be with too.  I could always get you something.

I just wish I could control it.  I had to stop raising my hand in class as my college professors found it disruptive.  I can't go to sporting events or concerts, or anywhere cheering might be involved as the constant incoming volley of cans or bottles or bags is difficult to deal with. Playing sports?  Forget about it.  

The worst though is what landed me where I am, in the hospital.  I was cruising down the street down by the beach. There was traffic and fair number of people.  I saw a buddy of mine and absently threw my hand up to wave at him as I called his name.  I big can of Foster's Lager hit my hand.  I caught of course, I always do.  I also lost my balance.  I mentioned the traffic right?

I came to while the paramedics were attending to me.  I was lying down, my right arm was broken, along with several other injuries. I was kinda out of it for a bit, but the horror my injuries were made evident in the hospital.  You see, because of the injury to my arm, and shoulder, and everything else, they needed to keep my arm immobilized.  And elevated.

Make it stop.  I can't take it any more.

Score: 341

Sir Ronald collapsed onto the cold stone floor. The statues of The Twelve gazed upon him, their faces cold to the knight's sorrow.

"What more do you want from me?" Ronald whispered, his voice cracking up. "I've slain the Beast of Darkness, I've saved the world from the flames of Azavar, I've returned the holy relics of Sir Veremur to their rightful place in your shrine. What more could you possibly ask of me? Why won't you accept me? When will my time finally come?"

The Twelve remained silent.

"For centuries I served you. I've seen so many of my friends and comrades pass on to your embrace. Am I really not worthy? Will I be destined to wander this land alone even when everyone else has fulfilled their purpose." Tears of pain and anger rolled down the old knight's scarred cheeks. "Is this my fate?"

The Twelve remained silent.

"Why? Why am I not worthy?" Sir Ronald jumped up to his feet, his voice echoing throughout the Great Temple. "I've done more than any other knight in the history of the Order! I deserve what is rightfully mine! How can you just stand there? Without me this world would be nothing, but dust and ash! Why do you ignore me?"

The Twelve remained silent.

"Answer me, pathetic fakes!"

Ronald felt his heart pounding in his ears. With his vision enveloped in a shroud of red, the knight gripped his sword and struck at the statue of the Allfather. A thundering crack resounded, as the marble cracked from the terrifying force of the blow. The pale head rolled off the statue's shoulders and shattered on the floor.

Ronald stared in disbelief at the dark blood pouring out of the cracked marble and creeping along towards his feet. Trembling, the knight made two steps back, horror gripping coldly at his heart. The red substance climbed the steel leggings, slowly enveloping Ronald. From the liquid he felt a warmth slowly building up into a roaring almost incinerating heat. It squeezed into every crack making it's way towards Ronald's body, surrounding him in a flowing burning veil.

The knight screamed in agony, feeling his flesh and bone being burned and rebuilt by the blood. Yet before long the pain ceased and only a sensation of newfound power remained. The sword in his hand ignited, painting the room with an ominous red light.

"So this is my fate?" Ronald asked, his voice unnaturally deep. "Then send your champions, gods, let's see who prevails."

Having said that, Ronald, who would later be known as the Godslayer, left the chapel, his laugh filling the halls.

What just happened... am I going insane? Did I pretend to hear her thoughts? Oh shit, she's coming over.

"Hey mister! You're pretty hot, for an older guy. Wanna buy me a drink?"

She is using me, I know it! I heard her thoughts. Can I do it again? Can I do *more?* I was just staring at her like this...

*God he is ugly. Two drinks and I am getting the fuck away from him. Wait, what the fuck am I doing... why am I leaning towards him, oh shit I'm going to kiss him!! HELP! OH GOD I CAN'T MOVE!*

*You think it's funny dressing like that? Tormenting men with those legs?*

*Oh Christ, how are you in my head? Please leave me alone mister! I'm only 15!*

*What am I doing...* 

"Leave the club and go home! Do not come back here until you are twenty one. Leave now or I will get inside you head and make you do far worse!"

How did I do that? I almost *made* her kiss me.  Good, she has run off. I would have hated myself for the rest of my life if I had even kissed her. My divorce was tough but this isn't the answer.

Those lads over there are laughing at me. I know it, I can see them turning their heads for a quick glance, then they turn back to their mates and laugh. They need to be taught a lesson. I'm going to take over the cocky looking one and have some fun.

*I'm glad that old guy is taking my mates attention away from me. I haven't smiled in a year. Not since mum died. I know my mates are totally fed up with me being such a downer, but man, I just hate my life. I hate myself.*

Oh shit, this poor kid... what's wrong with me. I have turned into a bitter and cynical old man.

*Hey, can you hear me?*

*Wh—who said that? Am I going mad?*

*No, you are not. I am a, um, an angel.*

*What?*

*I am an angel, and I am up here with your mum. She has a message for you.*

*M..mum?*

*Yeah. She says that she loves you, and that she is proud of you.*

*Oh God. Is this real? I'm crying in-front of my mates, I can't help it.*

*She says that it was OK to cry, but it's time that you found your smile again. She says you have a beautiful smile. She wants to see it again.*

*Please! Please tell my mum I love her and I miss her so, so much!*

*She already knows.*

*She does?*

*Yep, she knows. Listen, I have got to go. But remember what I said.*

Poor kid. Hope it gets easier for him. Hey, would you look at that, he's smiling.

#### [WP] Write a seemingly normal story, except for the last sentence, which makes the entire story creepy

Score: 335

They say parenthood is difficult, but my Charlie is an absolute angel! He stays perfectly quiet while I change him, never cried when I feed him his veggies, and loves going out! Just yesterday I took him for a ride in his stroller and he barely made a sound, he loves being outside so much.

Other people just don't understand parenthood. They recoil and act like they've never seen a baby, they gag and vomit as if they didn't shit their diapers too at that age. 

Little Charlie is the light of my life, but even he gets tired at the end of the day. So I put him in my car, through the driver's side of course. The passenger side still has a huge gash where that truck T boned me. I carefully buckle him in and drive him home, he needs his rest after all! 

I lovingly tuck him into his little bed, kiss his cracked forehead, close the lid, and begin to rebury my son.

They were so in love. He embraced her so tightly, she expressed herself so loudly that he made her quiet down as they didn't want to get caught. She even went on to tell people about her night with him. He was so embarrassed and bashful, claiming she exaggerated their experience together.

#### [WP] You're living in a fantasy due to a coma. But it's actually really great and you don't want to wake up. You try to ignore all of the increasingly obvious 'Wake up' hints being thrown at you so you can continue to live in your dream world.

Score: 329

"Fine haul today," the guard said, chuckling as he eyed the prisoner I was leading.

She was beautiful, with a creamy complexion, dark, doe eyes and rosy lips. The dress of sheer silk she wore seemed molded to her curves. Her wrists were bound together in front, causing her biceps to push out her already ample chest. No need to guess where the guard was looking.

"Careful with her, she's a witch. And a feisty one," I said, winking at her.

She pouted at me as the guard handed me a bag and said, "Don't know how you do it. Do you catch them when they're asleep or something?"

I jingled the bag's contents with a grin. "Interesting what can happen when you're in a bed. She's all yours."

"Come on, baby, let me off easy," the witch said. "Didn't I make you feel like you were in a dream?"

"See you when you get out," I said with a laugh. Giving her a final slap on the rump, I walked back the way I'd come.

We were miles underground, in the labyrinthine Hollows. Once the hidden fortress of a mighty kingdom, it had since been donated for use as a prison by the remaining members of the royal family. Now, only prison guards and their wards prowled the torch-lit caverns.

My breath misted the air as I climbed a sloping path toward one of the portals that led to the surface. Thinking back to the guard station earlier where I handed Theyenaa over, I wondered how they would treat her. Nothing harsh, I was sure. She had only been guilty of thieving, her victims usually silly but handsome men she had seduced into bed. Probably three days in a cell, three meals a day, and nothing more to endure than a few flirtatious remarks. The Wardens were unforgiving when it came to maltreatment of prisoners.

"I say, is that you, Virgil?"

The booming voice jarred me from my thoughts. I spun around to see the speaker peering at me from within a huge cavern to the side of the path. It was a red dragon, almost twenty feet long, lying curled up on a massive pile of gold coins. His scales gleamed with inner fire, and so did his eyes.

"Jonah?" I said, stepping closer to him. "Oh God, it's really you!"

The dragon snorted, beckoning me to join him with a clawed foot. "Been a while, old friend."

I shifted a small mound of jewelry aside to make some sitting space on the ground. "What're you doing here? Given up on arresting poaching dragonslayers?"

He sighed and turned his sinuous neck to look at the nubs on his back. Only then did I notice he was missing his wings.

"What happened?" I whispered.

"Ambush," he said. "It's all over for me."

"No, it's not," I said fiercely. "You still have your breath. Your claws, your sense of justice! You can't just sit here and mope about it. You can still do good!"

"You're one to talk," he said. His stare made me uncomfortable; it felt as though he was looking through me. "Why're you spending all your time down here? You're still alive. You should be out there."

I frowned. "I was on my way out when I met you. Dropped a prisoner off earlier."

"I don't mean the job. I mean your life." He fidgeted, causing coins to flow down the pile in mesmerizing streams. "I can't tell—er, listen, you need to get out of here."

"Now you're chasing me away?" I glared at him. "You were the one who called me here."

"Sorry," he mumbled.

"Well, if you're really sorry ..." I pointed at a massive golden crown at my feet. "Do you mind if I borrow this for a bit?"

He snorted. "Every time you 'borrow' something, I never get it back. Go ahead, but heed my advice," he said seriously. "None of this is real. Wealth—real wealth—is found in the real world."

"Right," I said, rolling the crown around in my hands. "Well, see you around."

Leaving the dragon in his room, I continued on the path, studying the crown. There was an old inscription carved on the inside.

"Let the Last King of the Watch wake the world from its nightmare," I read. Where did Jonah even find this thing? I had never heard of a 'King of the Watch'.

A turning ahead led to a tunnel, with cells on both sides. They were filled with shambling, rotting undead that gave off a strong smell of ammonia. Upon seeing me, they rushed to the bars, moaning, "Wake. Waaaaake."

"Shut up," I muttered. "I am awake."

"No, you're not," they said in unison.

"Shut up!" Their cries pursued me as I broke into a run. The portal wasn't far away. If I could get there, I would be back on the surface again, with plenty of coin to spend on women and music and good food. The good life was waiting to be lived.

The next area was large and open, and featured a tall stone construct in the middle. Between its two massive pillars shimmered the portal, looking like a rippling pond. But barring the way to it was a white, furry snake that made Jonah look like a tiny worm by comparison.

I gulped. It was one of the Wardens, an entity so old few alive knew its true name. It was watching me with three pairs of green eyes, flicking its three-forked tongue so powerful I could feel a mini-shockwave.

"Uh, hi, Warden Snake," I said.

"Enough games," it said. Rather, I heard the voice in my head; its mouth never opened. "You're only harming yourself."

"What do you mean?" I said, fighting to urge to retort impatiently.

"You don't belong here."

"I've been doing this for six months. I got my Arrestor license, fair and square. I passed training. Am I not doing a good job?"

"This prison is not meant for you," the snake said.

"I'm not a prisoner, I'm here on my own free will."

"You're being stubborn. You need to wake up and see reality."

Snarling, I said, "You don't get to tell me what to do, or where I should be! I choose to be here. I want to be here. I'm enjoying my life. I have money. The loveliest women I want. Respect, admiration, adoration! People want to be me."

The snake's head drooped a little as I continued shouting, "Look at me! I'm strong, healthy, I have abs for freaking sake. Do you think I want to be out there instead? Fat, stupid Virgil who can't even walk up stairs without panting? Sitting at a stupid desk, tapping away on a stupid keyboard with coffee stains left by its last user? Going home everyday to a wife who wouldn't speak to me, to kids who've replaced me with their phones?"

Tears crept out from the corners of my eyes. "I don't want the pain. If you know what really happened, then you should know—you should know I'm scared. I don't know how bad the crash was. Six months ... God, six months."

A long silence followed, punctuated only by my sobbing. And then the snake spoke, gently, "And yet ... nothing you described can compare to the pain felt by the people who love you."

Uncoiling itself, it slithered closer to me. "You could've thought up any other place throughout these six months. A beach. A palace. Your own island paradise. But no, you chose to work in a prison instead. I think you know why that is."

"I—I do?"

"Your services are no longer required, Arrestor," the snake said. Its eyes were suddenly glowing like suns, so brightly I had to shield my own. "Farewell."

The light grew—fierce, all-encompassing light—until my world turned to white.

And then, I heard a beeping sound.

#### [WP] You are a medieval knight that just ate a magic mushroom without knowing what would happen.

Score: 327

The battle raged around me as I choked on the mud with my dying breaths. I couldn't feel my legs; an enemy swordsman had raked his sword across my spine. I couldn't feel my left hand; it lay in front of my face, fingers curled up, like a dead spider. I couldn't see out of one eye; not with an arrow in it.

But I retained enough presence of mind to realize when someone stooped over me. An enemy, come to show mercy?

"You look like you need help," the man said gravely.

I tried to lift my head, to spit in his face for the insult, but my gaze made it no further than the hem of his cloak.

"Perhaps this will do." He held out a small, purple mushroom before my nose. Through the smell of blood, smoke and earth, I caught a scent of peppery sharpness. "Partake of this power, and rise once more, brave warrior."

Before I could resist, he grabbed my jaw and shoved the mushroom down my throat.

"But be warned," he said, rising once more. "If you do not have the strength, the darkness will not save you, but claim you as it has so many others."

"Let—it—try," I said. Then, I coughed up my liquefied insides all over his shoes and fainted.

***

Some time later, when the clash of steel had given way to the feasting songs of ravens, and the bellows of man turned to whimpers of pain and loss, I woke up on a field of fragrant, golden grass.

So unexpected was the sight that I leaped to my feet, only realizing a moment later that all the agony I'd been feeling had disappeared. Vigor surged through me, like the power of a thousand galloping horses, like the warmth of the summer sun. My detached hand began dancing in joy around me on fingertips, like a colt bounding around its mother. There were no ravens; tiny, winged unicorns flitted through the air, squeaking songs of romance.

"Look here, one of them's still alive."

I turned slowly to face the speaker. It was a giant of a man, seven feet tall, his brawny frame exposed in full, bare-chested glory. In fact, everyone there seemed to be built solely to make a nun question her life choices. Some were astride mighty capybara steeds. The capybaras had fur of every color imaginable, and they wore Ray-Bans.

The man hoisted a gigantic toothbrush in one hand. "Pick up your weapon," he said said. "I will not slay an unarmed man."

I was too busy studying my surroundings to answer him. The castle had become a construct of pink, wobbly jelly. On its walls stood enemy archers: fat, bearded babies dressed in red, with quivers of red-white candy canes. The brawny men had taken prisoners, beautiful women in bikinis who for some reason had very hairy thighs and rough voices.

"Fight me," the man shouted.

"Very well," I said. Bending low, I picked up a giant feather and held it at the ready.

With a roar, the man raised the toothbrush and charged, bristles rustling in the wind. I sidestepped his clumsy attack and tickled him across the back. Instantly, he deflated with a whizzing sound and went soaring away in the air.

The rest of his fellows began attacking, but I had the element of surprise. I plowed through them, turning dozens of these brawny fellows flat as paper and sending them on unwanted flights. The women began screaming my name and giving lewd suggestions as they flashed their breasts.

"I'm sorry," I said solemnly, taking cover behind a bread house as the archers let fly with their candy. "But I will have to swipe left for now."

Without their footmen and their cavalry and their capybaras (I felt bad about tickling them, they quoted Shakespeare before turning into handbags), the archers stood no chance. I cut them all down, turning them into piles of melted sugar that smelled strangely of Cuban cigars.

An hour later, I was the only combatant still standing in the castle yard. I wasn't the least bit tired, but the thought of spending quality time with all those women had me panting and drooling. But before I could make my way toward them, a thin man in a billowing cloak appeared next to me.

"It seems you've saved your kingdom," he said.

"You look like someone I've seen on Netflix," I said.

He patted me, almost sympathetically, on my stump. Noticing that the cut was now oozing with vanilla ice cream, I began slurping on it. For some reason, he winced when I offered it to him.

"I daresay the effects will wear off in an hour or so. If you survive, you'll be regretting this moment—"

Before he could finish, I punched him in the face. As he lay unconscious, I rummaged through his belongings until I found a small pouch filled with familiar looking mushrooms.

Without hesitating, I ate them all. I would make my kingdom great again.

It is said that on earth, when something breaks, everyone inexplicably becomes an expert.

Xlargok thought it was pure magic.

Just watching the creatures argue was a spectacle of its own, and Xlargok was glad he had brought his galacticom to translate it all.

"No, you gotta turn it *the other way*," a burly human was saying. "Here, give me the screwdriver-"

"I think it's not actually a screw," another human spoke up, eliciting deadpan stares from the other three humans. Perhaps, Xlargok considered, her mammary glands indicated a lack of the strange gift the other three humans seemed to possess.

"Naw, I reckon the crash must'a broken the glimmery bit loose, here, this part that's all beeping without sound somehow."

The burly man scratched his head, and gave the bit a *bang* with the screwdriver for good measure. Xlargok waved a tentacle in amazement. Somehow, the man had just banged on the hyperdrive *without blowing a good chunk out of their planet*. Truly amazing.

"So you were just driving by, eh, mister err...?" The third man held his thumbs underneath his suspenders and looked at the alien expectantly.

"**Xlargok**," Xlargok beamed the word into their minds using his mental gland.

"Right, right, xander. Fancy costume you got there. Don't worry, we'll fix up your car in no time."

"It's all the gadgets that he's put on it that's probably caused this in the first place," the burly man muttered, and the other two hummed their agreement.

"Isn't it that part there that looks even more odd than the rest?" The mammary human spoke up. "Honestly, I still think there's something very fishy about this whole-"

The other three shushed her. "Don't be rude now, Jane," the man with the suspenders said in a tone that Xlargok assumed entailed some local cultural significance.

The burly human turned to the lightspeed warp and gave it a good *bang*, and suddenly the control panel lit up again. Xlargok enthusiastically clapped his hands, all six of them.

"That did it," the man said triumphantly.

"Hey, you just hit the part that I told you was odd!" the mammary human said indignantly, but the other three ignored her.

"**Thank you, humans.**" Xlargok beamed at them, pleased with the adjustments. He got into the minimization room of his ship, kicking off the anti-gravity and soaring off.

The four humans stared at the sky for a while after he had disappeared, saying nothing.

"Strange fella," one of them concluded finally. "Must'a been from New York or sumthin'."

#### [WP] You finally meet up with with your online cosplaying group at a convention for the first time but you're starting to get the feeling that these guys aren't cosplaying.

Score: 323

“Could really use a beer right now,” Steve mused out loud as he pretended to eye the top of the convention hall, his moustach twitching. 

He twiddled with the hilt of his sword, causing his sword to swing wildly around his left leg. I noticed it seemed quite weighty for what was supposed to be just a prop, for his waistguard shifted visibly as he did so.

I had met up with this duo, Steve and Muni, outside Comic Con. We really hit it off over the net and shared an interest in cosplaying.  I was cosplaying a thief, Steve, a warrior, and Muni was dressed as a wizard. They insisted that we shouldn’t limit ourselves by cosplaying as a specific character from a franchise.

“Is that a hint? Is that what it is?” Muni asked. His eyes narrowed dangerously. 

“Well, I’m just saying…” Steve replied.

“Alright, fine. I don’t want to be accused of being stingy or hear comments about it *being free anyway*,” Muni resigned.

Muni adjusted his purple wizard hat, adorned with what I assumed to be random hieroglyphics, before holding out his left palm face-up. Right in front of my eyes, as his right index finger spiraled above it, a beer magically appeared. He handed Steve one, before making another one appear and passing it to me.

“Wha…!” I exclaimed. “What the hell was that? Was that magic?”

“Yeah, I’m pretty good at it,” Muni replied nonchalantly.

“Cool! Can you teach me?” I asked with the excitement of a young boy as a took a swig from the bottle. I was always a sucker for magic tricks.

“That… May be a little, uh, difficult,” Muni said. I got the feeling he wasn’t letting up on what he knew.

“Because…”

“Well, we, uh, can’t teach outsiders how to use – I mean - *do* magic tricks. My teacher forbids it,” Muni said.

“Okay… Nevermind then. Forget I asked,” I said. It really wasn’t that big a deal. I didn’t want to push my luck and be an annoyance to the group.

“Steve, your sword looks heavy. What material did you use for it?” I asked, eyeing his sword suspiciously. It *did* look too heavy to be a prop. It also seemed a little too sharp when he showed it to me before we entered the hall.

“I used metal for it. To give it, uh, a more realistic feel. Yeah,” he replied. The duo exchanged glances for a jiffy. I didn’t miss it.

The stark Sahara felt refreshing after half a day at sea.

When I was a kid, everyone laughed at me. "The Feeble Flash," they teased. The power of super speed, but crippled legs. Until the day my father decided to teach me how to swim. That was the day I realized I could still use my super power, just not in the way I'd imagined.

Now I'm a superhero despite my disability. When an oil tanker crashed off the coast of Nigeria, I sped out to help contain the spill. When a deadly outbreak of the flu hit the Philippines, I brought vaccines from the US in the blink of an eye. I've dragged in stalled fishing boats stuck in the Bering Sea.

"So you're still running the beta? I told you last week to patch it." James hated Mondays. He hated managing the engineers that spoke in long sentences full of acronyms. Mostly, he hated being stuck in this job with no way out.

"Yes," said the man across from him. He was fairly tall but his slouching and khakis that were a size too small made him look both taller and shorter at once.

"The stable release came out 10,000 years ago. And in all that time, you haven't upgraded it."

"Yes, sir, we were preparing the update for today, but an issue came up."

"Well, I'm sure that upgrading will solve your issues." James had never had an issue on his computer solved by upgrading, but surely there was a first time for everything.

"We'd have to reboot," the engineer offered.

"So reboot!"

"We...we believe that some of the simulants have begun developing rudimentary sentience. It would...remove them."

Suddenly, James felt like he was on much firmer ground. After all, he had aced his intro to philosophy class.
"No no no. They were designed to give the illusion of sentience Michael, but they can't actually think. They just simulate having a sophisticated calculator made of matter in their heads. No one could possibly *think* using matter. The idea is ridiculous. Imagine if you had to *think* using a piece of nerve fiber. You might as well think using an apple."

"Hrm, yes, well you see, that's the problem. We've...uh...The other day." Michael stopped for a minute. "I've talked to one."

James had never quite got the hang of Mondays.

"You've...talked to one? Did you bang together some pieces of air until their tiny little nerves could hear you?" James joked.

"Uh, no sir. If we adjusted the algorithm that calculated the air movement it..."

"How did you talk to it?"

"One of the patches in the release candidate was to patch a buffer overflow error that allowed for execution of arbitrary commands on the program."

There was a long, awkward pause. The tall man coughed. James gave him a stare that he hoped conveyed the message that he needed a better explanation without having to admit he didn't know what the problem was.

"It left a message for us on the server." There was another long pause. "It...she...saw the update being scheduled. She realized what it would mean and asked us not to do it."

James let his head fall into his cupped hands. "Michael. I need you to speak slowly and in very small words and tell me exactly what happened."

Michael took a deep breath. "We've known about some bugs in the program for a very long time. They've always had medicine men, witches, saints, people that learned somehow where a bug was, how to exploit it. They never knew how or why it worked, just that it did. But, someone has gone much further. She can use crystals...quartz I think... to poke a hole in the system. She can use the administrator screen."

There was a moment of silence.

"Look. The higher-ups said that they wanted to see the system patched last week. Hell, they wanted it patched 10,000 years ago. You patch it today or you're fired and I'll find someone who can."

"Yes, sir." Michael walked quietly out of the room.

James leaned back in his chair and took a sip of coffee. There was a secret to dealing with engineers. He might be getting the hang of this after all.

Score: 320

"So, this is you.... you are Michael?" the clerk asked, although it was more of an accusation, we both knew.

"Yes..." I trailed off, maintaining eye contact. My right shoulder twitched mutinously.

In my life I have had some particularly cringe-worthy moments, but now I had plumbed the depths for a new personal low. Using my recently deceased older brother's ID to try and buy beer felt like less of a tribute to him now than it had sounded in my head an hour ago.

As I looked into the clerk's eyes I detected a distinct glint of resolve, and I could tell this was about to end very, very poorly for me. I inventoried my options in an instant, and in my mind I decided the best option would be to insist I was my brother. My body determined the best line of action would be to cry, wet myself, and beg him not to call the cops however, and was a heartbeat from moving unilaterally for plan B.

"Michael!?" Cried a woman from behind me.

I turned around and recognized Tanya

My brother had always been an unstoppable force of willpower. He was my hero growing up. He performed well in school, was an all-star athlete, and always had the eye of the ladies. I would say that his Achilles heel was his hero complex (with which I was thankfully not likewise afflicted). 

He always wanted to save everyone. 

Tanya was his Everest. 

She had been Michael's girlfriend for almost all of high school and college, and must have taken Michael's successes as a personal challenge; the challenge being to see how much she could hold him back. She pushed for him to go to a local college rather than where he had his full ride, demanded he not attend parties at college in mixed company, and imposed other petty, insecure restrictions on him that I most certainly would not have endured, in addition to her otherwise insane histrionics. It had been around five years since I had last seen her and a couple years since my brother had finally broken up with her while over seas on his final deployment. When I had heard about the breakup I had been ecstatic.

Currently, her face was lit up with surprise and joy.

I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach.

"Oh, hi Tanya, how's it going?" I inquired dismissively, already turning around to try and make a speed record of the end of my purchase. The clerk, while still eyeing me suspiciously, was now ringing up my items.

"How is it going? How is it GO-ING?" She demanded while storming inexorably forward. It was clear that the surprise had worn off, and her face no longer displayed any joy either.

If I had any common sense I would have grabbed the next closest person in line for use as a human shield. She was on me in an instant.

"Here I am at home, WITH YOUR SON that you refuse to hear about, and you don't bother to tell me you are in town!?" She raged.

I felt like I had been punched in the face. I was never an uncle, was I? It had been so long since I had seen her and Mike had never mentioned a pregnancy... I felt sick. We hadn't talked much in the months before he was killed but I felt like this is something he definitely would have told me about, wouldn't he?

The clerk no longer held a look of consternation, and had instead opted to much more expeditiously ring me up, while paying much closer attention to the items on hand.

"We waited for years, YEARS, for you to see the light and come back, you piece of shit. Leaving us alone, without even your military benefits because you were too CHICKENSHIT to get married!" she roared, making accusatory chopping gestures in my direction for emphasis.

I had no idea what to say. I turned around again to the cashier who was now pushing my items at me and demanding money in a demeanor that was vaguely reminiscent of a how a robber in a stickup might.

"Don't you turn away from me!" She yelled. "You and I have a lot to talk about."

I grabbed the two six packs and headed for the door. I felt a burning shame and confusion roiling inside me, but I knew there was no way I could let her malign my brother like that. Pieces were falling into place, and the picture they were creating of Mike was not flattering. I just wanted to go home and digest, preferably with a healthy dose of beer.

"I joined the Army to escape you, you evil bitch. You only ever held me back." I choked out, with my hands full of six packs. I moved for the door and only looked back once as I hustled through it.

I almost made it to my car before she got to the parking lot.

"Donny." She yelled.

My name stopped me with my door still open. I placed the beers down on the driver seat slowly. She closed the gap on my car with a couple quick strides, dropping the angry pretense.

Now it was my turn. The confused and upset feeling was giving way to rage building up inside me like pressure in a pressure cooker.

"You knew ... you really ARE an evil bitch." I intoned matter-of-factly. "You know who I am and you put me through that right after my brother died? You know Mike died right? But seriously, there is no kid? You guys broke up years ago..."

"Hold on." She said dismissively, waiving away my words. She came in close, then reached into my car and pulled out one of the six packs.

"No, the kid isn't his, and yes, I know he is dead. This is the tax for getting you through that shitstorm you were brewing in line. And for not telling your mom, dickhead."

"I can see why he left you." I said angrily, letting rage get the better of me.

She looked me up and down with a calculating look, then turned to walk off with my beer leaving me with just a single six pack and a final quip.

"I can see why you wish you were him."

Score: 320

My friends had opted for the surgery too. We had made a pact to go through it together but they had developed their powers over a year ago. Meanwhile I waste my days still stuck in a wheelchair, still breathing through a tube and now watching them all outside; flying and fighting and having fun. They practice to become *heroes*.

Today I look out of the window onto a grey sky. A single ray of light creeps through a crack in the clouds to glare blindingly in my eyes. I am taunted even by the heavens. I try to move my head to escape the beam, but I am unable to shift a single inch. Instead, I shut my eyes and block out the world.

---

The years have passed and my friends no longer visit. They are too busy now. I despise them for leaving me here to rot. Everyday is grey. I no longer look out of the window but instead keep the curtains drawn. The light can no longer torment me.

The nurse enters my room uninvited. A fat thing with huge drooping breasts and a sarcastic face.

"Hello! How are you doing today?" she asks, knowing full well that I cannot respond.

"It's a lovely day outside! Shall I open the curtains and let the light in?"

*NO!* I scream silently, desperately, **NO!**

She pulls back the thick fabric and releases the light. It dances gleefully around the small room. It reflects off  my metal wheelchair and into my eyes. I am enraged. If only I could move. The hate pulses through my head, through my veins and through my heart."

"Are you OK Xavier? You look quite il—*gghhhh!*"

I squeeze her neck. Not with my hands but with my hatred. It is like watching a chicken having it's neck wrung. 

She slowly turns red, then blue. Then limp.

If I could smile I would. Instead, I channel my hate into my chair and slowly move out of the room. I will one day find my *friends*, but now I must prepare.

Score: 318

"A what?" I asked.

"A scientist!"

I swallowed. "A what?"

He looked confused. In his defence, it was the exact same question I'd asked a second ago. "A scientist!"

"Yeah." I said. "Yeah..." There was a moment of awkward silence. "So..."

He turned to my adopted family and looked at them derisively. "You don't belong with them, wavin' wands and making dishes fly through the air when you need to wash up. You belong with us."

I brightened. "So how do we wash dishes?" I asked.

"Well..." he said. "With sponges. And arms."

"Arms?"

"Yeah. Our own arms. All... scrubbin' like."

I smiled encouragingly. "Right."

He shook his head. "This isn' about washing up, Henry. It's about changing the future!"

"The future!" I exclaimed. "How?"

He took my hand in his giant shoulder. "Through painstakin' research, my boy! Through arduous peer reviewed repeatable experimentation and constant academic scrutiny!"

"OK... What about the rest of my life? I'm on the Quidditch team!"

He shook his head. His hair followed, a moment later. "Quidditch is a game for those that rely on magic! We have football, Henry! Assuming you don't get knocked out too often. Or soccer! Where you can touch the ball five or six times an hour! Or athletics! Which yer clearly not cut out for. Do ye know what bowling is?"

I couldn't help glancing at my aunt and uncle. "No..." I said. "But anyway. Tell me more about this science. It's as fantastic as magic, right? I can make wondrous things happen?"

"Yes, my boy!" Higrod pulled me towards him and pointed out of the window at some imaginary future. "Although the road is not easy. You'll be challenged."

I squared my shoulders. "I can take it!" I said.

"Of course ye can. Challenges will face ye along the way. Through questioning yer methods and doubting yer assumptions. But ye'll persevere."

"Will I? And will people recognise my perseverence?"

He gave me a seesaw gesture. "Sure, there'll be bad journalism, distorting the views that you made very clear in your abstracts. Of course, there'll be internet pundits simplifying your views to absurdity. And you have to expect click-bait articles making promises on your behalf that are inconceivable within your lifetime. But if you stick with it, my boy..."

"Yes?" I asked, trembling with excitement.

He leaned in close. "Yer very own Google doodle."

I sagged. "Really?"

"Possibly on yer hundred and sixty eighth birthday."

"Right," I said.

"If ye're not dead by that point."

I nodded.

"Which ye will be."

"Yeah," I said. "I'm going to stick with magic."

#### [WP] After a freak accident, you've split into two versions of yourself. One good, the other evil. For some reason you two are able to cooperate quite easily.

Score: 318

"It's not quite what I thought it would be," I say. I reach out and touch the face of this other half of me. It looks just like me. Like staring in some sort of twisted mirror where I move and the mirror doesn't. Like getting really high and feeling like having an out of body experience but instead of staring at *myself* myself I'm staring at...

Well, I guess I'll call her Pa. 

A voice booms down at us from an intercom somewhere. It's a live voice, not the prerecorded kind that plays on commercials. It's a voice that I know we can talk back to - a real human sitting somewhere near enough to see us but not very near at all. Some paradox of far-but-not-far, an observer who can watch and tell me what I'm seeing and why I'm seeing it but who is unable to feel the strange sensation of dissociation and rapidly infusing morphine-induced euphoria. "Separation complete. Meet yourselves, girls." 

"Did you know that this was going to happen?" Pa looks scared. She must be the good twin. Which makes me the evil one. Except I don't feel very evil. I don't feel like I want to go around burning things or killing people, or even hurting this strange mirror image of myself that does not mirror me. I do not look scared. I force the muscles of my face to move so that I do not look scared, rearranging each facet of my face like a piece of some puzzle until I am but a blank experimental page for the far-but-not-far owner of the voice to watch. 

Pa blinks at me. I haven't answered her question. I don't plan to. She walks to the door and peers out of it, standing on her tiptoes and coming back. She sits down on the floor. She is a constant stream of motion. With every move she makes I force a bit of cement into my muscles - consciously imagining that lactic acid is filling my body from the bottom to the top, simultaneously freezing and releasing me from the need to be able to move. I am frozen - call it too much pot again - paralyzed from the high that is allowing me to see the strange hallucinations that are before me. 

This isn't a hallucination. I know it's not. She is the good twin and I am the evil. 

"They can't do this to us," Pa is saying. She's sitting on the floor again, cross-legged, looking up at me like she should have pigtails instead of the long straight hair that hangs about her shoulders. She - I - sort of look like this manifestation of Asian-meets-Aryan, some thing that was molded from clay by a God and then throw out into the trash with that sound - *pah!* 

"Please talk to me," Pa is standing now. Her hands are on my shoulders. She's pushing me. Somehow this contact breaks me, like I'm a glass of water and she's dipped her finger in and pressed so lightly yet just right on the surface and broken the tension and broken through to me. I almost fall into her. 

"I'm here," the words echo in the room and do not seem to come from my mouth but they are not the words of the far-but-not-far intercom woman. Pa is sitting, saying *we need to get out of here* and I agree. 

"Why did they do this to us?" Pa is asking all of the questions that I feel I should be asking and thinking. She is the speaker and I am the thinker, apparently. Speak kind words, think the truth I suppose. It occurs to me that she is looking at me again. I wonder if there are as many thoughts in her head as there are words in my mouth. 

"We need to get out of here," I'm just repeating her words now. Parroting them. A sick mirror of *her* now, but delayed by a few moments. A playback. A choral round, beginning to sing just as she's two syllables in, our tongues and teeth moving just the same but at different intervals. 

"Pa!" Pa shouts. It occurs to me that to Pa *I* must be Pa, and *she* must be I. It is a very confusing situation. I think of the intercom and the woman's voice and the fact that she is far-but-not-far and watching us but not close enough to be in this room with us. 

"I'm here," it's my voice. 

"We need to get out of here." 

Third time's the charm. "How do we get out? The door is locked. I remember - we remember. Being drugged. Being dragged here. The experiments. The torture." 

"It's horrible," Pa's voice is small. As if on cue the door to the room buzzes and opens on its own. I imagine the far-but-not-far woman sitting in her chair with her feet up on the table as she sips a soda, *slllllllllrp hrphrphrphrp* and watches two parts of the same girl argue. It occurs to me that this might be their plan - to release us and see what we'll do. 

"We should go," Pa, the talker, is talking. I look at her and nod. I am tired of talking and I would rather think. I think of destroying the people who did this to me. That settles in my mind that I must be the evil twin. There are worse things to be, but it occurs to me that I'll never have my own narrative. No one ever follows the narrative of the evil twin. I am thinking of how I will spend the rest of my life being misunderstood and misinterpreted by people who look solely for good. I am thinking this way when Pa wanders out the door and looks back at me and says, "Come on, Pa!" and I once again remember that in her mind - if she has a mind - *she* is I and *I* am her. 

I follow her out. The hall is dusky. I want to ask Pa if she feels the same heaviness and dizziness. The sort of dizziness that comes from waking up in the middle of a dream that seemed too much like reality. Pa is over by the window of another door now and looking in and her mouth is slack. I go to join her, the dizziness trying to pull me down like strings tied to synapses inside my brain, little tugging pulls that remind me of looking into a flashing lightbulb and the bright red dots that continue to swim after I blink, threatening to run each time I look directly at them. Pa is looking into a room and there's a man that's strapped to a table in the room, looking directly at us but not *at* us. 

When I stand back I see the little sign on the door, the three triangles that come together and make me sick. That sign isn't on our door - the door we just came from - but it is strangely reminiscent of some other door. Pa looks at me and I look at Pa - we're having the same thought, except she says her out loud to me and I think it but don't say it. That we were in that same room with those same three triangles, except maybe it was before *we* were *we* back when *we* was *I*.

"They're making superheroes," Pa is taking the words from my brain. But we can't both be superheroes. Not if one of us is good and one of us is evil. That's what they told us they were doing, back when *us* was *me* and I had the same ability to speak and think and I wasn't overwhelmed by just one process. Pa is speaking aloud everything now - the triangles and the superheroes and how one of us is good and evil, though she doesn't mention which she thinks she is maybe to spare my feelings on the matter, though my feelings feel fairly stoic and non-emotional about the whole thing anyway. I'm too busy trying to call back the feeling of being too high that all of this might be some dream from a drug trip far before. 

"Pa," Pa waves her hand in front of my face like I haven't been looking at her the entire time. Her hand has those after waves, those fuzzy lights that follow, little imprints of her hand burned into my eyes. Suddenly my head hurts. Everything is coming back - memories of screaming. Of torture. Of green IVs and yellow triangles and of becoming me and her. 

"Pa," Pa says again. "Pa. Don't you see what they're doing here?" I want to say that of course I do. Of course I see. Instead I clench my hands tightly together and shut my eyes to make the pounding stop. I raise my fist and I hit it against the wall and I feel the wall crumble underneath me. I think of the man in the room with the three triangles strapped down to the table with his IV full of glowing liquid and the screams and if he will be an *us* soon, as well. I know exactly what they're doing. I know exactly what they plan to do. 

"We won't let them," Pa is saying. She's taking my hand. Her hand. They are perfectly aligned, copies of a hand that should not exist. Like cupping my fingers together, sliding my own fingers up my wrist and grasping. Pa is putting her arms around me and I'm letting her even though the anger is building inside of me. But unlike what they wanted my anger is not at her. She is me and I is she. She is good and I am not. I won't be what they want me to be. Not to her.

"We'll do it together," she's saying. She's squeezing my hand. 

I wonder idly if there is room in the world for two superheroes who are at the same time exactly the same, and at the same time completely different.

#### [WP] You are a hero with a strange power. Every time you raise your hand in a catching position, a voice yells a party nickname for you and a drink or drug tossed into your hand with impressive speed and accuracy. This is your epic.

Score: 317

My theory is that it's magic. I don't know how, I don't know why. But hey, free beer.

Let me start over. My name is Michael. Mike to my friends, and I have no idea what I'll be the next time I put my hand up. I am a superhero. I think, at least. I certainly have a super power, but it only became useful during college. I'm a senior now, so I'd like to focus on my classes, but I don't know how to turn it off. But you have to believe me, because trust me, it gets awesome in a second.

So, here goes. When I raise my hand, like if I'm moving to catch something, someone yells a nickname for me, something like "COWBOY MIKE!" (I own no cowboy hats or cowboy gear of any kind, so I have no clue where that came from), and then a drink is thrown into my hand with the speed and accuracy of an MLB fastball. It is unreal how fast it goes. The drink varies too, even to drinks that one definitely does not throw. I accidentally raised my hand in chem lab once and caught an appletini, salt and everything. It even had one of those little umbrellas.

It's made me pretty famous around campus, and I even once had a TV crew interview me. I don't think I'll exactly be asked to join Overwatch anytime soon, since they have all have actually useful superpowers, like that superspeed girl with the two pistols. But hey, it's not awful being a minor celebrity. But here's where it gets cool.

So we had a supervillain attack the campus. Like, an honest to god supervillain. He called himself Ferryman, and he was trying to goad Overwatch into a fight by taking hostages. No one wanted to mess with the dude holding two shotguns and seemingly able to produce more from nowhere (probably his superpower, maybe a variation of mine but actually useful), so he managed to take the student center hostage. Of course, since I was stupid, I had my headphones in, and I walked into the student center somehow. And there he was, black robes and all.

I was hung-over at the time, and not really in a mood to deal with anything. It hadn't really made it through my skull that I was facing down a legit supervillain, so I pulled a trick I had mastered during freshman year. I turned around, raised my hand so it lined up with his mask. The voice yelled "THE MAN, THE MIKE, THE LEGEND", and I dropped my hand right as I saw the drink. Ferryman got clocked right in the face with a loaded can of PBR.

I guess it was more the surprise of it than any real injury, but he was out cold. Just to make sure, I kicked him in the head a few times. Of course, my luck being as it is, Overwatch rolled up right at that moment, to see me, Michael Ferris, standing over the prone form of a supervillain. The exchange had been caught both on security cameras and several phone cameras.

I received an official commendation from Overwatch "for my heroic actions in the face of grave danger". I got to shake the hand of Strike Commander John Marion, which was probably the coolest part of the whole thing. I also got someone's number. I think it was that Egyptian sniper chick, since she introduced herself as Amara when I texted her. I didn't know Overwatch recruited 21 year olds, but apparently they do. We're getting drinks in about 15 minutes, so I gotta go.

Moral of the story, kids, even if your superpower is useless, you might get lucky. Keep at it, learn the ins and outs, maybe you'll get somewhere. Like me.

#### [WP] In the future Earth is fighting a desperate war against aliens. With no other option, we start to use heavy genetic engineering, effectively making most humans like nightmare monsters. After victory, the unaltered refugees on a secluded planet do not recognize us for humans anymore.

Score: 310

The next month would mark the 78th anniversary of the mass exodus from planet Earth. Just one year before that, they came. These beings from the corner of the Baziniel galaxy. First contact seemed genuinely peaceful as we exchanged gifts and research. Yet their captain was overthrown by a planned mutiny, and the new leader desired nothing but the rich ores our planet sheltered. Days turned bleak as they began systematically bombing our land to get closer to the rare ores near the earth's core. We tried stopping them but our measly weapons were no match for what they brought. Scientists and experts declared that the only way for survival was to leave this planet and seek refuge on Mars, at least until another solution was found. The aliens didn't care one bit about human life, and didn't blink any of their six eyes as we launched ship after ship full of humans towards Mars.

What those people aboard weren't told was that they had left a small percentage of the population behind, to stand against these intruders. We were told that ethics would be thrown out the window in our fight and that we would do anything to win and bring our people back. So our scientists spent over half a century perfecting this serum that destroyed and rebuilt our DNA piece by piece, fine tuning each and every one of our attributes by tweaking the order of the base pairs. We gained traits and abilities no man ever had before and had become less man than the very creatures we were fighting.

Once this serum was perfected, it was quick work defeating the alien invaders. We kept their ships and tools to study, but executed nearly every one of them. We kept two alive, not as prisoners, but as friends. Two who were friends with the original captain, and did not come to Earth seeking riches. However we told them, any slight misbehavior and they would end with a bullet in each brain.

It has been almost 10 years since our victory. We had tried to salvage what we could off this planet but there was little hope. We knew our time was short and had to move out. We contacted our brethren on Mars, looking for a warm welcome. The scientists there took one look and were aghast. We were not recognizable anymore. They pleaded for us to stay away, believing the true human population would think they were under attack once again if we showed up. They explained that the humans on Mars would take no chances after their last alien encounter, and the military had been ordered to shoot any foreign being on sight.

We were disheartened after hearing our fate after sacrificing everything about ourselves for the greater good. Yet we understood. We had to make a home for ourselves in some other region of this universe. The scientists had freed us from our chains that linked us to mankind. They told their children that all human life had died on that planet 78 years ago. And they were right.
